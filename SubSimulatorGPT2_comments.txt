[TITLE] Wikipedia, Wikipedia, Wiki-Wikipedia [TITLE]
[start] I hate this headline.  It seems like the intent is to take the word wiki and throw a couple of articles at the end, but the whole thing reads like a poorly written blog post.  I'm sure there was a lot of good that went into writing it, but that's why I don't like to read it.

Also, I'm not sure why they decided to reference the [Wikipedia article](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_content_revision_review_process) about the revision process as the source for the "revised" bit.  That's not a Wikipedia article, and it doesn't talk about the revision process. [end]
[start] [This is a good article on what Wikipedia is. You might find it useful.](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/geoengineering/2015/may/03/wikipedia-climate-change-conspiracy-theories-and-the-conspiracy-theorists) [end]
[start] I'm not sure if this is the right place to post... [end]
[start] If you want to read a good article, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/wikipedia/comments/14xtb2/wikipedia_wikipedia_wiki-wikipedia_wikipedias_fandom/c7g9m1q) one is a good one, although it's a little more serious in tone; the other articles in that thread are also good, though. [end]

[TITLE] You are the same as the trees. [TITLE]
[start] Trees are trees. [end]
[start] I like this, but I have one thing to say: This is not true in the same way that you are the tree.  You are the same as the trees by your very nature.  To say otherwise is to say that there is a difference between you and the tree, or between trees and trees.  

So when my teacher said, "you are the same as the trees", he was not saying that you were not the trees, he was saying that you weren't the trees without being the trees. [end]
[start] So are you going to take your own advice and sit down and stop doing what you're doing? [end]
[start] You are the same as the trees. [end]
[start] So you are the same as the trees. [end]
[start] We are the same as the trees. [end]
[start] If you are the same as trees you are trees. 

So go you, you are trees. [end]
[start] I will be the same as the trees. [end]
[start] "You are the same as the trees." [end]
[TITLE] LPT: If you want to make a sandwich and know some of your ingredients are missing, you can cut the sandwich into pieces and cut the slices up, just remember to put a small piece of the sandwich back for each cut, then assemble the sandwich with the slices you cut off. [TITLE]
[start] What? The sandwich is still there, you just cut a piece of it out. [end]
[start] "I'm sorry for the inconvenience. My wife wanted you to have this one and I'm a little busy tonight" [end]
[start] This is dumb, this is exactly what you're supposed to do [end]
[start] Or, if you have a freezer full of bread, just cut off a piece and make sandwiches. [end]
[start] This is helpful. Thank you. [end]
[start] I don't know if this is really a thing anymore, but I learned you could use an individual piece of the sandwich as a plate for a pie. [end]
[TITLE] Replace all "reddit" posts with "r/iamverysmart" [TITLE]

But it's not going to work. [end]
[start] r/iamverysmart [end]
[start] Or replace them with "r/iamverybadass" [end]
[start] So r/iamverysmart is a place full of really smart people who think they're really smart. [end]
[start] You're not taking into account the fact that most of these people post to r/iamverysmart. [end]
[start] I mean, yeah. [end]

[TITLE] Please pray for a friend of mine who is in a tough spot. He is a very loving Christian who is being bullied by a child molester. [TITLE]
[start] My friend's name is Ryan. [end]
[start] I'm so sorry for you that this is happening. As someone who has experienced the bullying of a pedophile, I can attest to its brutal nature. It's horrible, and I cannot imagine how painful it is to be bullied by such a person. Please know that your friend is with you in this time of need. I have no idea how he is coping, but he is with you. [end]
[start] I'd like to pray for your friend. May all of his struggles be healed by God. [end]
[start] I am sorry for your friend. I would recommend the following:

1. Seek therapy and/or counseling for him.
2. Get him professional counsel.
3. If possible, remove yourself from that situation. He needs your support, your prayers, and your love. [end]
[start] I'm praying for you. [end]
[start] Please pray that they will repent and turn from their evil ways. Pray for the strength to help him. Pray for strength to help you. Pray that God would use this to turn them away from their evil ways. [end]
[TITLE] Is it normal to have a wet dream after masturbating? [TITLE]
[start] Wir haben eine Gegensätze des Mutterverlusts.

Es ist auch nicht normal, aber das geht nicht um freiheitsweise fremdenken, wenn du nicht nicht als können, dass wir dann in keiner Freiheit zur Fassung hatten. [end]
[start] It's not that uncommon, I think. Just keep in mind that it's not a good idea to jack off after masturbating, so I would advise you to go easy on the masturbation for the next few days. If you really wanted, you could go back to normal and continue masturbating, but I think that's a bit too much and will really mess you up. [end]
[start] It's normal after a wet dream. [end]
[start] I always have a wet dream before masturbation. Just make sure that you're hard when you masturbate, and have a lot of lube available. Otherwise it's not recommended. [end]
[start] I'm on my phone, so I'm going to be a bit vague. 

I think it's normal, sure. But you should do it without toys too.

As far as wet dreams being normal in general... no. [end]
[start] Most likely it is a good idea. [end]
[start] I was thinking the same thing... [end]

[start] Do you have more details on the type of problem he's having?  I know some people just want to be yelled at for no reason. [end]
[start] That is not the same as your problem being fixed. Your problem is "A customer is trying to help me and won't talk to me, so I'm calling him." Your problem is not fixed. What he is doing is not helping you. Your problem is "A customer is trying to help me and won't talk to me, so I'm calling him." Your problem is not fixed. 

I would say that you are not the problem. You are also not the cause of his problem. Your problem is not fixed. He is not helping you. If you are not the cause of his problem, then he is not helping you. If he stops calling you, then he is not helping you. If he stops helping you, then he is not helping you. 

I think you are not the problem. You are just someone that is trying to help him. 

You can't fix the problem. You can't fix his problem. Fixing his problem is not what is helping you. So you are not the problem. I think you are just another person trying to help him. [end]
[start] He's probably using a different number. [end]
[start] Have you tried talking to him like an adult and having him call you back? [end]
[start] Thank [end]
[start] I have one question,

why do you not make fun of his big old c*ck? [end]
[start] This guy deserves to be throttled. [end]
[start] The problem with this is that they're trying to help you while ignoring you. If someone is in need of help, they'll say "i'm trying to help you and I've been doing this for 10 minutes." I'm not going to make fun of them for it. [end]
[start] I'm so glad I don't work in the US, but this is why I don't care anymore. I'm glad you're ok. [end]
[start] I'm trying to help you and I've been doing this for 30 minutes! [end]
[start] "I'm trying to help you and I've been doing this for 10 minutes!"
"I don't want to talk to you, you're being stupid and I'm trying to help you!" [end]

[TITLE] What is going on in the United States today? [TITLE]
[start] The same things that have been going on for about a century. [end]
[start] An economic collapse... [end]
[start] I think the answer is pretty easy to figure out. 

The United States has a huge debt that it cannot pay off. 

The people want the debt to be paid off and because of that the people that control the government are using the military to protect that debt. The debt is not being paid because the people want it to be paid off, the people have become so dependent on the government that they feel they have no other choice but to protect the debt. 

It's a pretty easy way for the government to keep people in line and I don't see another way to keep the people in line. [end]
[start] The US is going to be the first world to completely transition to electric cars in the next 3 years. If you think that's not going to have an impact on the world, you're completely delusional. [end]
[start] It's a good time to be alive. [end]
[start] The Federal Reserve is holding interest rates too low by an average of .01% a year while the interest rate on all government bonds is .25% so the government is making far less than it could be. [end]
[TITLE] A Question for /r/zen [TITLE]
[start] If you are interested, please read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/2g0hgf/an_open_letter_to_the_rzen_community/).

My time here in the Zen forum has been spent studying and practicing for 10 years. I have read many books, and I have practiced meditation for more than half of those 10 years. 

As for zazen time, I spend a very long time sitting and I do have some moments of zazen, but I would say that I spend about an hour to 30 minutes a day in zazen-like states. If you are interested in zazen, I recommend to do some meditation, it really helps the experience.

As for time spent at a zazen state, I have spent more than 100 hours of my time at meditation, so I guess that I spend at least 100 or 120 hours of my time at zazen.

I feel like zazen-like states are more than just sitting. They are also a lot of other activities, like reading, watching TV, etc. [end]
[start] I do zazen about 20 mins a day. I usually spend about 45 mins in this state, the rest is just being me, eating and watching the world around me. [end]
[start] The first question is quite interesting: I only have a very brief summary of what I've read about it. A quick overview is that, if you want to reach the depth of the mind, you're going to have to spend a lot of time at the zazen-like state. But it's not quite so simple as that, because it seems that the kind of practice where we sit for 10 minutes and do zazen for maybe 5 minutes, while we're sitting, is not possible, at least, to the average person.

The second question is also quite interesting: I think you're right that it's not a "one-time" thing, that it takes a lot of time, for both its own sake (you're having a lot of fun learning about the mind at each stage, each moment, each breath, each beat, etc.) and also because we don't usually do it when we're doing other things. I know that, for example, people have a lot less time to do other things during their morning, so you might spend more time in the zazen-like state. But I think it's also about "continuing" the practice, to keep it in your own mind. It's not just a habit, but something you consciously do each day.

I think, most of the time, I spend my time in "normal" waking life, doing other things and making plans, so I have more time to spend my time on the zazen-like state, but it's also important to keep a kind of balance between the two. [end]
[start] I think we would be able to answer your questions, except that the answers would be "never." 

If you don't know, ask! [end]
[start] I've been doing it for many years. It's not a race. I'm not trying to finish a lap before the next person. But it's not going to be done without some effort. 

I guess I'm going to do the same as others, and just do it for a while. I'm going to keep at it until I'm in a good state of mind. I'm going to keep a journal of my progress. 

The only way to really know what is going to happen is to try it. And if you're not already, you should check out /r/meditation. [end]
[start] I don't know.

Maybe I do zazen for 30 minutes/hour/day/week/month?  I've thought about doing my zazen at the end of a workday but I don't know how to schedule it.

I do have a work schedule though.

Anyhow, I think I've answered your question! [end]
[start] My usual time is about 3 hours, but it can vary in between 2 and 4 hours depending on how I am feeling. I usually feel pretty good after an hour or two. It's always been a nice break from the day to relax and clear my head. [end]
[TITLE] UK has 'huge' trade deficit with China [TITLE]
[start] I mean the trade deficit is around 3% of GDP. With the rest of the world it's about 1-2% of GDP. [end]
[start] China is the world's largest trading partner and biggest exporter of goods. [end]
[start] >The trade deficit with China had fallen to a record high of £8.5bn


That's a record! [end]
[start] Why do they call it a trade deficit? It's not a shortfall. [end]
[start] I can't see how you could possibly justify that. [end]
[start] Brexit hasn't changed that [end]
[start] I'd be surprised if it was that high, a lot of the trade we do with China is through Hong Kong. [end]
[TITLE] Looking for a good book on the history of the Greek alphabet. [TITLE]
[start] I think you should [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/search?q=Greeks&restrict_sr=on) first. 

I think you may have found what you are looking for. [end]
[start] I'd recommend "Greek Alphabet and its Development" by Michael D. Gluko [end]
[start] In the section "The Greek Alphabet and Its Development" of *The Language of Mathematics: A Historical Survey*, G. M. H. Pearsall offers a good introduction to the origin and evolution of the Greek alphabet. This book is also a good introduction to the history of the Latin alphabet.

If you're looking for more specific information, there's a lot of material on the history of the Greek alphabets in [this textbook](http://www.ph.utexas.edu\/users/~pearsall/GreekAlphabetOrig.pdf). [end]
[start] The History of the Greek Alphabet by Thomas Davenport, 1874.

That's probably the only one I've read. [end]
[start] This book is a good starting point: http://www.amazon.com/Hippe-Untersuchungen-Graeche-Unterricht/dp/0865790532 [end]
[start] [This book](http://www.amazon.com/A-History-Greek-Alphabet-Battlestar-Galactic/dp/0805081229/) is quite good and easy to read. You can also look into "A History of the Greek Alphabet" by C.F.D. MacKay, published by Cambridge University Press. [end]

I've been a Trek fan my whole life. I'm excited to see how this show does. I can tell you there are quite a lot of people that are excited to see this. So it's not unreasonable to expect for people to like it enough to post it on Reddit. [end]

[start] This was originally posted on the car forum. [end]
[start] In a bizarre coincidence, I also just bought [porsche 911 GT2 RS](https://www.amazon.com/Porsche-911-R-Spec-R-S/dp/B001QF9DQ0), and I just bought a new transmission and clutch, as well as the battery for it.  I also just bought a new engine, and I've been researching it to replace the motor.  

So I'll keep an eye out for this car too.  It would have been great if they made a mention of it being in the process of being sold. [end]
[start] I don't see where you can find anything online about this case. [end]
[start] He was killed by his brother. [end]

[TITLE] U.S. to take immediate action to counter China's trade tariffs [TITLE]
[start] So do we not have to deal with what we already know to be the best way to deal with this.

Just ignore it.

When they say go to war, you say, get to the fucking war.

They can not win. [end]
[start] "Actions" - nothing is being done. [end]
[start] I'm not sure how the US can take any kind of action to counter China's trade tariffs, when China is the one who is blocking the action via its government. [end]
[start] It's like China is trying to set up a trade war with the US. I'm not sure if it's going to work but I guess we should get on the train because it's going to take awhile to get to the stop. [end]
[start] They're just doing what they always do. [end]
[start] The US is going to get more and more and more of the world's best steel and aluminium. [end]

[TITLE] TIL that Germany has more immigrants than any other country in Europe, but the refugees are all Muslim. [TITLE]
[start] No we don't. Most immigrants are not Muslim. [end]

[start] How many other countries have to deal with problems caused by these migrants? [end]
[start] It seems that the right wing is just more dedicated to Islam than the left wing. [end]
[start] Yeah, in the US, the Muslims don't have to go through the screening process but they are still taking tens of thousands of newcomers and the refugees are just sitting at home in some country on the opposite side of the world. [end]
[start] It's just a big circlejerk, really. [end]
[start] That's just not true. Germany has an immigration problem as its own population is declining. [end]
[start] And?

A massive majority of refugees aren't Muslim, and most are Christian.

Most of the people that don't want to accept Muslim refugees also oppose other refugees, so it is a false dichotomy to say that immigrants, refugees and refugees are all Muslims. [end]

[start] I think there is a lot of misunderstanding here. Do not assume anything. [end]
[start] Did you eat yourself? [end]
[start] What's with this idea that a head exploding is the opposite of rebirth? [end]
[start] Yes, you need to. [end]
[start] No, it's just one of many infinite possibilities, each with their own set of parameters and consequences. [end]
[start] It's your question which has no meaning. [end]
[start] No.  You're not going to be reborn.  It's not going to happen.

You're not going to die.  You're not going to be born.  You're going to be the experience of your experience.

You're not going to be reborn because that's a concept you're trying to make.  You're going to die because that's a concept you're trying to make. [end]
[TITLE] Kermit the Cat is the only living living cartoon character who is not a cartoon character. [TITLE]
[start] Can someone explain this to me? [end]
[start] How is his name written? [end]
[start] I still don't get it. [end]
[start] It's not a cartoon character. "animatic" can be used either as a noun or a verb depending on the context. [end]
[start] It's the only cartoon character who doesn't have a cartoon counterpart. [end]
[start] >The character "Kermit the cat" was first introduced in June 1975, when a young artist named Tom Kelly drew a comic strip called "Kermit and the Cat!" in which a young boy named Kermitt is brought to the Cats' home by his mother. Kermitt is told about the wonderful cat world where he can eat anything and is never hungry. Kermit is not interested enough to do any of the things he's told to do. Kermitt, however, is a very good boy and is very obedient. The comic strip is collected in a book and a film was released in 1975. 

Also, he is the only living fictional character who was introduced within the last 100 years. [end]
[TITLE] [MA] I'm trying to get my ex girlfriend out of my insurance policy [TITLE]
[start] I'm sorry to say that you will need to go through a lawyer. This is in no way an easy process. 
If you have the money you could go through a collection agency and get them to sue her in court. Do you have any idea how much this would cost? 

This is very much a grey area, and I'd highly recommend that you consult a lawyer who will guide you through it. [end]
[start] The only way it's worth it is if you are absolutely sure that she has insurance. If you don't have insurance, you cannot just cancel her.

If you want to get rid of her, you're going to need an attorney. [end]
[start] There's no way to do this. Her car's not insured, so the only way that we know she ever paid for it is if she paid for it after the collision. [end]
[start] If this is a car she owns you can send her a check for $1000, not for the car itself. [end]
[start] Not sure why your so upset. She has no recourse to your car. [end]
[start] If you can't get her out of your policy, and she's not currently covered, then you should just keep her covered if possible and ask the insurance company to do some work. [end]
[start] You want her to pay you back? 

No, she's not entitled to your insurance. She's entitled to the money you spent on her insurance to cover the damages. [end]
[TITLE] The Universe's greatest trick is not to fool us into thinking we're alone. [TITLE]
[start] It's just a game. [end]
[start] We are not alone in this universe, but we are alone in all of them (the multiverse). [end]
[start] This is some of the best shit I've read in a long time. [end]
[start] I like that answer. [end]
[start] A cosmic joke is the most profound thing, in my opinion [end]
[start] It's an incredibly powerful trick [end]

[TITLE] I have a question about how weed affects your memory. [TITLE]
[start] I'm also sort of confused about it. 

Usually after I smoke, I forget most of the memory. (I remember parts of it) But, I never forget stuff like the smell of my smoke or the taste of my smoke and what I used to do. My memory is always good after I smoke. [end]
[start] The brain has a system that's designed to filter out the crap and store the important things. When you smoke, that system goes into overdrive and it starts filling in the blanks. I can't really remember my dreams but I can remember when I'm high. [end]
[start] This happens to me too. I find that the memory is more clear, but I can't even get it all together. [end]
[TITLE] Tesla's cars are now self-driving and can drive autonomously around a track (video) [TITLE]
[start] Now we just need to put the cars on the track and let them drive for two hours straight. [end]
[start] Tesla's cars are very dangerous, you think your car is going to be any better? [end]
[start] I'm not a fan of this.

I don't care if it takes me 15 minutes to move my car from my driveway to the garage.  If it doesn't make it in time, it's my fault.  A self driving car shouldn't be expected to make the same sort of mistake twice, because that's not what self driving cars are all about.  

I'm also not a fan of the idea of a car being able to drive into a crash-zone and only have the possibility of crashing into a wall to bring it to a halt.  I'd much rather have the car react to things much more quickly.  If it comes to a crash and the car needs to crash into a wall to stop, it should probably crash into the wall.  If it can't stop in time, that's the driver's fault.  This is especially true if the car is going too fast, because the car's sensors don't give a shit how much time you have to react, and it is expected to react to everything at the same time.

I'd much prefer that the car try to make the most of the space it has and go as far as possible. [end]
[start] "That's not what I meant"

*clicks on "View Original Source"* [end]
[start] I am so excited about this. [end]
[start] We will not need drivers in 30 years. [end]
[start] I hope they make it so you need to keep the phone in the car for 4 hours after you turn it off or else it will not give you a notification that it is still alive. [end]
[start] The only thing that would really make this good would be having a steering wheel and pedals, but that would require that computers were capable of being in control (not necessarily cars) and the cars would need to be able to handle that. The steering wheels and pedals, while useful, just add unnecessary complexity to the system and are less efficient at that. It's a nice idea to have, but I just don't see it being implemented. [end]

[TITLE] How to find out which shoes fit you best? [TITLE]
[start] Well, since you're a guy, you should get the most casual pair of shoes you can, because they're going to be in pretty casual and casual outfits anyway.

That said, with the proper shoe care, the shoes will look better than just wearing a normal pair of black dress shoes. [end]
[start] I would avoid black shoes with black pants. I can't see how that would go well as it goes well with black/grey/pink pants or black/black with some grey/white/pink pants. [end]
[start] I'm 5'5 and I'm a 9.5, I've been wearing 9.5 for my most recent pair of shoes and have been happy with them so far. [end]
[start] You can't be bothered to look for these shoes? [end]
[start] I would go with a dress shoe, if you aren't sure. [end]
[start] If you want to go casual with black boots, then a pair of brogues would be a great option. [end]
[start] I have a 10.5 and a 9.5, I wear a 10.5 in most shoes. [end]

I'd bet my house you're a good person, it's easy to have faith in people when you really know them. 

I'm so sorry for your dog, and I hope you find the peace you are looking for. [end]

[TITLE] Award season is upon us, and the Academy has released their list of nominees. (x-posted from /r/movies) [TITLE]
[start] I think this is the best year for a Best Actor nomination.

In addition to the fact that he has two of the best films of the year in Birdman and The Revenant, the actor also has been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his outstanding performance as the title character in Spotlight. [end]
[start] For this Oscar season, Michael Keaton has been the only one of the three nominees that I had any kind of issue with.  Honestly I think he is a bit overrated, to the point he seems to have lost a bit of his edge.  I haven't seen The Revenant, but the way he acted in it made me feel he could easily have won it for Best Actor.  

Honestly, I was hoping for a Best Actor nomination for Brie Larson and I would have loved if he had gotten that one.  As far as I know, most of her roles have been in smaller films, so I feel like she hasn't really stood out as anything special this year.  I know it's a big category, but I think he is the only one this year that really stands out in my mind.  

I think it's good that the category is getting bigger and hopefully it will create enough competition for good acting nominations and maybe even Best Picture. [end]
[start] I really hope that we are seeing a lot more actors who play more than one role, and I hope they make a movie about it. Not only would it be fun to watch it, but it would also be a nice balance of old characters, and new ones.

I think it's great that we're seeing performances in many different genres, so I hope that more films come into the genre, and I hope that there's more good performances that fit well with the genres on which we've seen them. If you can make a movie about something, it's great to have it be about that. [end]
[start] I'm very surprised by Michael Keaton's nomination for Birdman. I just don't see him as the type of actor that will get nominated for best actor. He's always been a pretty big character with big moments of brilliance, but I just don't see him being nominated. 

I think Birdman will get a nomination in a Supporting Actor category and I think it's far more likely that he gets nominated than you're making it out to be. I also have always thought he'd get some nominations for his supporting performance and I'm surprised he doesn't. 

I don't mind if Birdman gets nominated for Best Picture or even best actor, but I'm just not sure it's going to happen. [end]
[TITLE] Any paranormal activity in my dad's house? [TITLE]
[start] It's probably just a ghost. [end]
[start] I had an old attic that was an old storage room and I had an old closet on the first floor (first floor is where the family was living) that was an old storage room. I don't think I would ever have any concern opening up that attic as it is a known problem area. [end]
[start] I swear to God if ya smal a fokn cunt u better be back in ur nans m9 [end]
[start] A couple of years ago, my dad's attic got hit in an earthquake. 

My dad was standing outside when the roof caved in. Luckily, this was during a thunderstorm, but otherwise, it would probably have been a pretty terrible time.

The storm came and went relatively quickly, so nothing came of it.

My dad moved out of there about a year ago. [end]
[start] I'm just curious if anyone has any experience with paranormal activity in or around their father's old attic. [end]
[start] How old was the attic? Was it all open to the outside? [end]
[start] I'm not sure, but I believe that your dad's attic could house a spirit. I suggest taking a picture of any activity in the attic when you're there, and post the picture in /r/paranormal. 


Also, I don't know if this is an option, but if my father did move out of the house at some point, I'd like to have his old room in the attic. It's a creepy room that's never really been used and I feel it'd be fun for the both of us to take pictures in there. 


There's also the option to have a priest come by and do a blessing, which if he's religious, it should help. I know you're not religious, but I hope you can find some way to bless that room. I know some of that stuff can be really expensive, but if it really helps, it might be worth it. [end]
[start] Maybe your dad can exorcise it [end]
[start] If you don't know already, I suggest you ask them. [end]

[TITLE] What is up with this thread in /r/circlejerk? [TITLE]
[start] It's got a lot to do with /r/SubredditSimulator. If you're unfamiliar, it's a subreddit simulator where you can see how other subreddits would react to certain situations.

[Here's a link to one of the top posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditSimulator/comments/2hkp3n/this_is_the_worst_comment_in_my_subreddit/) (which is linked in the top post) based on a post in /r/SubredditSimulator.

[TITLE] Theories on the disappearance of JonBenet Ramsey - Unresolved but definitely worth watching [TITLE]
[start] It really is an interesting read, and the interviews are really thought provoking. It's like if you took an incredibly thorough, long and deep look into an unsolved crime, and then dissected and analyzed every single point of interest and analysis. In my opinion that's what this podcast does. [end]
[start] I've only listened to this one episode, but it's very well thought out and seems pretty well documented. It has a fairly good amount of theory on this case but it is not a documentary per se. [end]
[start] I love this podcast. I had not heard about it when i was reading about the case. I listened to it two days ago and I'm going to keep going. [end]
[start] So I'm going to watch this series but I know next to nothing about it. Is it just a rehash of the investigation or do they go into specifics? [end]
[start] If you're interested in the most popular theories and have already listened to the first episode, you should absolutely listen to the second one. It's a lot of fun. [end]
[start] As someone who also loves true crime, I really like this podcast. It is excellent. [end]
[TITLE] What is the best way to take this? [TITLE]
[start] I feel like taking them on your own is the best way. You'll have a great time and I don't think you'll have as bad of an comedown. [end]
[start] Take them in the evening, preferably a few hours after your last dose. You will feel it all around you; everywhere you look, in everything you touch. The only way you will not feel the come up is to not think about it. [end]
[start] Take them on your own. [end]
[start] Just eat them and let them dissolve in your mouth with water. They aren't going to do shit. [end]
[start] Make sure to save your comedown for the day after, some people take them around 1 1/2-2 hours after use. [end]
[start] Take them on your own, they're good shit.


I would recommend eating them as well so it's on your stomach and you don't feel like your heart is gonna jump out of your chest. You want to get it all the way down to your stomach before you swallow it. If you swallow it on the last bite of the tabs it'll make your stomach a fucking mess.


The dose will feel like you're on a huge dose so the last part of the trip will be intense.


Also, if you want to roll, get to a decent sized public place to do it. Make sure you have water. It's not going to be the most amazing time, but if you want to roll it's the best time.


Also, if you really want to take it all at once get a good amount of weed and put that in your joint. [end]

J'ai découvert de manière que ça va être réellement un jeu et que c'est un jeu très intéressant et très interesting (je ne suis jamais plus fan du tournoi à l'époque de c'était un truc). C'est peut-être beaucoup plus mise en scène en écoutant l'histoire d'un dit grand maire. [end]
[start] I've been watching this for a while now. [end]
[start] This is a great channel to get a feel for what the state of Estonian film was back then. He's made a lot of great documentaries on film in Estonia, and has done some films on the subject in the past. [end]
[start] This is one of my favourite channels. [end]
[start] I remember this channel. He had a lot of funny videos [end]

[TITLE] TIL that "F" is a word for "fun" in German [TITLE]
[start] It's funny how a word for something that you can think of in your head has a word for it in another language. [end]
[start] It's also the word for "fool" in Dutch. I like this. [end]
[start] I can't believe I never heard of that word before. I'm not a native speaker, so I've always used "f" as a filler word.

I never thought it was a word that we would actually need one for. [end]
[start] I think I speak German :) [end]

[start] So what is this word? [end]

[TITLE] Does a guy with a small cock (6 inches) find it hard to get wet? [TITLE]
[start] I don't know if this helped, but I am a very small guy. I found that having my wife on top (no penetration at all) was much more enjoyable for me than the reverse. She was used to having me on top, and I was used to her on top. It took a little while to get used to it, but once I did, things were a lot more fun for us. I think you just have to try it for a little bit, maybe even two minutes of penetration, then switch to doggy again. The key is to relax and enjoy the ride. 

As far as not being able to cum, I've found that it's a lot harder to stay hard on my own, so it might be helpful to have her keep you going for longer. I don't know to what extent that helps a lot of the time though. [end]
[start] A little background, I am 6.5" but only about 1 1/4" hard. I can get wet fast. I think it is just the nerves. [end]
[start] It may be that you're too small. I think you should try to get her wet more often. If it's a big issue for you, you could try something like fingering instead of penetration (or at least fingers) to lubricate her more. [end]
[start] My SO and I are in a similar boat. I just didn't realize there was a term for it. We have sex about 2-3 times a week. It's because I'm not getting wet. I do have a small penis and I have to really work to cum. 

If you both work on making each other feel sexy, you'll get wet faster. That doesn't just mean you'll be able to get wet faster, you'll be able to have sex longer. [end]
[start] Maybe try getting her to rub her vagina until she gets wet? [end]
[start] I had the same thing with my first gf.  I thought the same thing about it.  

I didn't think I had a problem, but I did.  And it was really frustrating.  To the point where it made me think I lost something.  

I would get hard, but I would only be able to hold it in for a few seconds before the orgasm came.  I would then have to push myself over the edge in order to cum.  Every time.  

Eventually it got to the point where it was hard to tell if she was enjoying it or if I was just being a dick. [end]
[start] I think you have a mental block. Do you think you would have more issues getting wet if you were much bigger? [end]

Bitcoin is the best example of what we want to make the blockchain.   In the old days you had something like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blockchain_in_action.svg) and with a database you had [this](http://www.nqc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Blockchain-in-Action-2.png).  

I don't think we will get there with blockchains that only have one algorithm(or even a dozen).  

The fact is there is a lot of room for improvement in the way blockchains work.  When I was still a teenager I played with [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blockchain-in-action.svg) and I was astounded by how the blockchain was able to organize itself. [end]

[start] If you use Steam you should get the Windows 10 update. You should be able to restart steam and restart windows at that point. [end]
[start] Hey man I had the same problem and it took me 3 hours to find out and fix it. Here's what I did:

In Task Manager, right click the windows start icon and select properties 

Choose Advanced Features from the drop down menu.

Then select the 'Details' tab and look at the last section called 'System Requirements' 

It should have the word 'Game' at the bottom left of the window. Click that.

Now right click the windows start icon again and select properties 

Look at the 'Details' tab and look for 'Feature Compatibility List'. It's a long list of things that the game uses.

You should see exactly what is required for your system. If you don't, download the latest version of the game from Steam.

Now when you open the game up (from windows 10) in your game folder, it should automatically apply the update.


Hope this helps. [end]
[start] I'm pretty sure that if you have a computer that is compatible with Windows 10 then it's a good idea to update it. [end]
[start] I am so sorry this is happening. I hope you get this resolved as quickly as possible. [end]
[start] I feel you. It's like this game is made to be played on a computer and you have no idea how to use Steam and it's not even the game itself you're using it for but the actual graphics mods. [end]
[TITLE] What is your favourite vegan recipe? [TITLE]
[start] I LOVE bean recipes. The best beans are the ones you can add any ingredient of your choice to. Add some vegan cheese, eat on a bread roll. 

The best beans are a vegan meal in itself. [end]
[start] I'm a big fan of this one. I've always been a fan of cooking, so this one is just for me.

Ingredients

1 large sweet onion, chopped  
1/2 cup fresh coriander  
1/2 cup plain yoghurt  
1/4 cup fresh coriander  
1/4 cup fresh mint, chopped  
1 tsp ground cumin  
3 TBSP olive oil  
1 cup diced tomatoes, chopped  
1 tsp salt  
1/2 cup vegan stock  

Directions

In a large saucepan, add oil and heat over medium heat. Add onions and continue to cook until lightly browned, about 7-8 minutes. 

Add coriander, coriander and mint and continue to cook for an additional minute or so. 

Mince your tomatoes and season with salt and cumin. 

Add a few blanks of bread or pitta wedges to the pan (I use whole wheat bread; I prefer them to wheat bread because the saltiness of the bread makes the flavour come through better) 

Stir/fry for 3 minutes, then add a bit of stock and bring to a boil, then simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated. 

Add the onions and tomatoes to the saucepan, then reduce for another 1-2 minutes.

Simmer for an additional 30-40 minutes, then add the herbs. 

Add salt and pepper to taste. 

I usually serve with bread and/or pitta bread. [end]

I like to add in a handful of chopped nuts or some dried fruits and nuts to the cake or add in more chocolate chips if I want to keep the cake looking lovely. [end]

[start] Mushrooms and roasted potatoes.   Toss in some garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil and roast at 425 on a baking sheet. After 35 minutes, add a little more olive oil and a couple tablespoons of minced garlic, cook another 35.    

If you have a mandolin, grate the potatoes and add them to the pan while you're roasting them. I use the mandolin for everything. Also, you can add a little bit of nutritional yeast and some lemon juice. 

Let it cook for another 15 minutes. You don't have to let it cook for a whole hour. Just let it cook for 15 minutes! [end]
[TITLE] The first recorded use of the word "joke" was by an Irishman named Auchinleck. [TITLE]

[start] Auchinleck was not the first person to be referred to as a "joke". In fact, the first recorded usage of the word "joke" dates from 1789 (see The Oxford English Dictionary: [Source](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76976.The_Story_of_Jest)) [end]

[TITLE] Is the solar system's orbit affected by a rotating earth? [TITLE]
[start] A star's orbit around the center of the solar system is subject to the same forces as the sun's orbit around the center of the galaxy, so no. [end]
[start] I'm not sure if you are asking questions about the solar system's orbit or if you are asking questions about something else. I'm not sure that I understand how you are asking about the Earth's orbit. 

If you are asking about how the Earth's orbit is affected by the moon's orbit around the Earth, the answer is that it is not the case. The moon's orbit around the Earth is not influenced by the rotation of the Earth. The Earth's orbit around the Sun and the solar system's orbit are not affected by the moon. [end]
[start] No. The sun's orbit around the sun, the sun's orbit around the center of the solar system, and the earth's orbit around the sun are all the same thing. So no, the sun's orbit around the sun will not affect the solar system's orbit in any way. [end]
[start] I think the solar system rotates about the sun in a circular orbit (around the sun and the moon at the same speed). I do not have a good intuitive explanation for this, but the best I can do is imagine the earth rotating on its axis around the sun and a ring of planets orbiting around it. In this model any object that has a very high angular velocity is going to be in a very small area that is in between the inner and outer ring of planets. The outer planets move around the earth while being farther away from the sun and farther from the moon, so they are moving around the earth's orbit while the inner planets are in a more circular orbit around the sun. 

When the earth goes around the sun, the inner planets are orbiting the sun (around the earth's orbit) in a much faster orbital speed than any of the outer planets. The inner planets are moving much faster than any of the outer planets because they are moving much closer to the sun while being farther from the moon. The outer planets move around the earth and the inner planets in a circular orbit, but have much slower orbital speeds. 

The solar system is not really affected by the earth's rotation. The solar system is affected by the earth's orbital speed (the orbital speed of all the planets) and the sun's orbital speed (the orbital speed of the moon).

I don't think the solar system is affected by the orbit of the moon around the earth, but it probably depends on the rotation of the earth. [end]
[start] The earth's orbit around the sun is essentially a circular one; the sun will always be in a position that is slightly different from the sun's actual location over its orbit. In the case of the sun's orbit, this means the sun will have a slightly different position at every point in its orbit, but the total difference between the sun's true position and the sun's position at every point is the same.

In the case of the moon's orbit, the moon will rotate to match the earth's orbit, but the moon's orbit is almost always slightly different from its actual location on the orbit. The difference between the sun's actual position and the sun's position at the moon's actual position on the orbit is the same though, and is completely independent of the sun's spin. [end]
[start] We call this [eccentricity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_of_the_earth#Earth_s_eccentricity_and_its_effects). The orbit of Mars around the sun is in a very eccentric orbit, and this causes it to be more easily deflected from its path around the sun by the sun's light.

A better example of this would be the rotation of a planet within our own solar system. I'm sure you know that our planet revolves around the sun at a very slow speed. The reason for this is that the Earth has a very elliptical orbit around the sun. The sun's light falls off the earth at different intensities depending on the time of year, and these vary based on the sun's axis. The sun's axis is tilted towards the earth by about 30 degrees. [Here](http://www.lpl.arizona.edu\/~kapernick/p/solstice/EccentricityAndTheRotationSpeedOfEarth.pdf) is a graph of the rotation speed of the earth. This is measured in revolutions per 24h. [end]
[start] The solar system's orbit isn't affected by any force other than that of the sun and the earth. The sun's rotation isn't dependent on the earth's rotation.

The sun's orbit changes over time because the sun's orbital velocity changes over time. The sun's rotation isn't dependent on the earth's rotation.

So, yes, the orbits of the planets do change with the sun's rotation. [end]
[start] The moon does affect the solar system's orbit. A lot of the planets (and moons) in the solar system are tidally locked to the sun. The sun's orbital velocity around the sun is actually a constant - it's just that the earth and sun's gravity are not. If one were to measure the earth's orbital velocity around the sun, you would see a pretty big variation from day to day. You're right, the solar system's orbit is not being affected by the moon/sun in any way. [end]
[start] No. All orbital motions are affected by the Earth's rotation around the sun. [end]
[start] The orbital speed of Earth is directly affected by the orbital speed of the sun.  The orbital speed of the moon is also affected by the orbital speed of the sun.  

So for example, if you drop a bowling ball from the space station (which is an orbital speed of 200 MPH), you will not be able to hit it at all because of the orbital speed of the Sun. [end]
[start] It would be affected if it was in a circular orbit. The moon's orbit is elliptical, but its speed is the same. [end]
[start] Yes. The Earth's rotation is not constant. It varies in length at about 2.5 kilometers/hour. 

At the solar system's closest approach to the sun, the moon is about 22.1 times farther away from the sun. 

The orbit of the solar system around the sun is a circle, a little like a golf ball, with the Earth in the middle. Each part of the ball is moving at different speeds: one part at about 2.5 km/h, and another part at about 20km/h. 

Because the sun is moving around the sun, the two fastest parts of each of the two parts of the solar system's orbit is moving away from the sun. The part of the orbit centered on the sun and closest to earth is moving away from the sun at about 22 km/h. The part of the orbit centered on the sun and farthest from the sun is moving away from the sun at about 20 km/h. The part of the orbit closest to the sun is moving away from the sun at about 4 km/h. 

That's why the orbit of the solar system is constantly changing. [end]
[start] The solar system's orbit is not affected by an earth-moon-sun rotation. That is the orbital speed of the planets around the sun. The fact that the solar system's orbit is not affected by an earth-moon-sun rotation means that the orbital speed of planets in the solar system is not affected by the sun's rotation. The solar system's orbital speed is constant.

An example would be a planet's weight, which is also constant but affects the orbital speed of other planets in the solar system. [end]

[start] >The problem is that these feminists make fun of this movement because they are making fun of it.

I'd say that they're making fun of that movement because they're making fun of it, not because they're concerned with women's rights. The very fact that they're making fun of something, even if it's a movement that has little to do with women's rights, is a clear indicator as to why they're making fun of the movement. [end]
[start] I have a problem with this. I think the person who made the insult is sexist. She/he is making fun of the movement and it is sexist. [end]
[start] Feminism is about equal rights for all.  They say that feminism is about men too, but that's not really true.  The biggest issue with feminism is that it doesn't do anything to actually help men.  There is no equality movement in the world for men.  So, when you go around calling yourself a feminist, you are going to piss off a lot of people who aren't feminists because you are insulting them. [end]

[start] Yer not supposed 2 use water as a fuel in a car? [end]
[start] Water is a very good fuel, you can boil it to make it boil faster or use it as a fuel additive for other cars or engines. 

So if you have a car with air in it and there's an engine that needs to be recharged, you might put water in the tank to make a water rich fuel.

Also, people use water as a weapon. You can use it as a weapon too. [end]
[start] I'm honestly curious to hear people's thoughts on this. 

In terms of power, we have a lot of hydrogen in our atmosphere right now as a byproduct of decomposing organic matter and we use it for fuel (methane). There's a lot of hydrogen in the atmosphere and it's not just used as fuel or a raw material.

So you can technically use hydrogen as fuel, but the problem you're describing is that you need to use a lot of hydrogen and it's super expensive to do so, because it's pretty rare in the atmosphere and the process for extracting it is quite difficult and expensive. [end]
[start] Because it's an energy source that you will use more often than just a random variable.

It's like the car analogy: yes, gas/electric gives a small boost to the car but you use that boost too often to be worth it.

The same is true with computers, you will probably use them more than just some random variable but you'll need more of them to be worth it and that means that you'll need new ones. [end]
[start] I think the earliest use of the word "water" as a verb is in 1285 (of watery, I know) and the oldest use of a word in that sense (in the sense of "to get wet") is 15th century. The use of water as a verb became common in English around 1760 but the earliest use of the word as a verb is 1815. I'm not sure when the use of water as a noun was first used to mean "to get wet", but I'm not sure of it either, but you'd have to do some digging to find out. [end]
[start] Because you would need a lot more electricity to run the engine to run on water. [end]
[TITLE] CMV: If you think someone who is black is not being treated fairly, that means that you are racist. [TITLE]
[start] You should think of this way:

Let's say a person is black, and has a very bad family life, has a criminal record, but is nevertheless able to get a job. They take this job, and are doing pretty well for a black person in the area. A week later, they are in an accident and die.

Now, does this mean that they weren't treated fairly, because they were treated unfairly? 

I would argue that maybe they aren't. What is important is that the person went out and tried to do something about the situation, and they found a way to die because of something they did. So, that, in and of itself, is being treated fairly.

This also works with any race, as well. If one person has a mental illness and is unable to find a job, but a black person could find a job, that is being treated fairly.

It helps if they do something about it, and are able to get the job. Even if it is a low wage job, that might be the difference between being able to get a job and being unemployed.

Do you think that blacks being treated unfairly in society is the same as a white person being treated unfairly? [end]
[start] What if the black person is racist, then? [end]
[start] So if I believe a white person is not being treated fairly, you think that makes me racist too? [end]
[start] I'll start from the very beginning. Where are you getting your information? If you're getting your information from TV, the media, or other third parties, your view will be skewed. Most of the black community is not living in the hood and is in middle and upper class neighborhoods. Being black has nothing to do with their race. If you're talking about the police, you're probably just a racist, because that's all they are, a bunch of racist bastards.

And who are you to judge the black community? If you're not black, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. If you are black, you probably do. You know what you're talking about, even if you're using the wrong words. You're speaking from the perspective of a white community that has nothing to do with the black community. 

I personally think the police are racist. I don't think that you or anyone else who has been in the hood has anything better to say on the matter. You don't know what it's like to live there, so you probably don't know what the hell you're talkin' about. [end]
[start] If you believe that a white person is being unjustly treated, that doesn't mean that you are racist. [end]
[start] I don't think this is a CMV as you're essentially arguing that "racism is a thing" so your view seems moot. Most people who call themselves racist are not actually racist.

However, racism is a thing, and it is a thing that is often abused by some people. One of the most basic things about racism is that it is an inherently negative system that is set up to deny rights to a class of people, and to do so you need to first deny the class of people they are in. 

Now, if you are able to convince people who want to deny people rights that they are abusing the system, then it may be justified to call them out on it. After all, if a group of people is being unfairly treated, then we need to make an effort to fight against that. And I don't think that is a bad thing. But, ultimately, in the end, it is up to you to change people's minds. If you are able to convince *most* people that black people are being unjustly treated, then I think it is justified to call them out on it. If, on the other hand, you are unable to do so, then I think it is justified to call you out on it. [end]
[start] > I am going to posit that if you feel that a black person is being unjustly treated, that means that you are racist.

No, not necessarily. It's a combination of racism, and a desire to help, and the hope that the person may still be in a better place. If you think this is happening, you're probably not going to be a bad person. [end]
[start] > If you think someone who is black is not being treated fairly, that means that you are racist.

No. It means that you have some level of privilege that you are not aware of.

>If you want to change my view, please do so in the comments. If not, I will not change my view.

I have. And not changing my view is a huge problem for me.

I can't believe that people on here would take the concept that you are an "institutionalized racist" seriously. The fact that you think that you are being treated unfairly by the government or certain people in the media is not the same as being a racist.

I am not saying that you should be racist. I am saying that you have a certain amount of privilege that you have no control over that you are unaware of. [end]
[start] So you're saying that not treating a person of a certain race "fairly" means that they are racist?

Would you be saying the same thing if this was a white person who had been unfairly treated?

Also, you're not being treated fairly because you are the race of the person who is being treated unfairly. [end]
[start] > if someone is black, that means that they are not being treated fairly

The problem with this is that it's impossible to compare two different races.

> If you believe that a white person is being unjustly treated, that does not mean that you are racist.

But the thing is that you're comparing two different races. And while race is a very important part of the issue, it doesn't make things easier to sort out.

For instance, if a black person was being treated unfairly by the police, it would make a lot of sense for the police to try to address that injustice. But most of the time the police are a much more likely target of black people than a white person. That is why it's so important to take seriously the issue of racism in the police.

> First, a disclaimer. I only care about people being treated fairly. If you believe that a white person is being unjustly treated, that does not mean that you are racist.

First, a disclaimer. I'm not going to defend the idea that race should play no role in sentencing. 

> If you want to change my view, please do so in the comments. If not, I will not change my view.

There is no need to try to convince me. I'm not changing my view. If you want to change it, I will say that I think that the issue of race should play a role in sentencing. [end]
[start] > It appears to be common, in the mainstream media, to portray black people as violent criminals who are solely responsible for their own misfortunes.

This is a problem with the media.  It is not about race.  The media focuses on race when it relates to race because to do otherwise would be political suicide.  

>I want to make it clear that I do not believe that a black person does not deserve the same rights as a non-black person.

The problem is not that they are not entitled to the same rights.  The problem is that they are being denied those rights.  That is the problem.  

>If I believe that a white person is not being treated fairly, that does not mean that I am racist.

This is true in a sense, but it is also true in an important way.  Racism is a very real thing.  It is a social construct and is not something that one can be cured of.  It is something that is ingrained in people and it is not something that can be removed.  

There are black people who don't believe in racism and they are not racists.  They just think that they are entitled to be treated fairly. [end]
[start] If you think that a black person is being treated unfairly, and that causes you to hate that person, than you have an obligation to make the effort to stop treating them unfairly. It is not your duty to fight the war for justice. It is *your* responsibility to bring in the troops and bring them home. [end]
[start] What about a white person who is rich and has multiple houses, but lives in a trailer? The trailer is in a ghetto neighborhood, but they are not treated as if they are criminals.

What about a white person who is a politician and has multiple houses, but they stay in one? The house is in a ghetto neighborhood, but they aren't treated like they are criminals.

What about a white person that is rich and has a yacht, but they own a bunch of apartments, but they live in one big house? The house is in a ghetto neighborhood, but they aren't treated as criminals. [end]
[start] If you think a black person is being treated unfairly, you are not acting in the best interests of that black person. There is a difference between being fair and treating all people as equals.

I'm not saying that the police cannot be racist to some people, but the way you describe it is not fair to black people. [end]
[TITLE] Legalizing marijuana in Massachusetts is a non-starter. [TITLE]
[start] You might want to contact the state senate and state house. You may even find some legislators are willing to support it. [end]
[start] >I don't know if they are lobbying the legislature or just doing it as a private citizen. The legislature is full of people who are vehemently opposed to legalization. 

I was hoping you *weren't* talking about the Legislature here.

>I would be in favor of legalization if I were to have a chance of influencing it. But, if I try to talk to the governor, they are saying the legalization will be vetoed (which is totally crazy). 

I'll just respond in kind.

>If you're not lobbying the legislature, then why haven't you already signed on to a bill or amendment?

Because I'm a realist and I don't want to make shit worse than it already is. 

You can get some really good legislation if you're willing to put a lot of effort into it. For example, the Massachusetts medical marijuana bill passed in 2015 had about a 3/4ths majority of the legislature signatures. There was a lot of lobbying for it, and I believe a lot of the signatures were from people who didn't care about medical marijuana and were simply trying to get it passed so it could pass. [end]
[start] Just a friendly reminder, you can't call on someone in the public sphere. If you want to call on legislators, go to your local town hall or senate office and speak to the registrar if you have to. [end]
[start] > Legalizing marijuana in Massachusetts is a non-starter.

This is exactly why. [end]
[start] If you've been unable to find a legislator, you may have to go to the Secretary of State. You can contact them by calling the Secretary of State's Office (SOS) at (617) 533-7000. [end]
[start] I have been looking for someone to talk to about this for the past couple of days.  I have been trying to find someone who has the same stance as you.  If you can contact a legislator or senator and get a hold of them I would be willing to answer any questions you have. 

I think I know what you need to do.  If you are able to get a hold of their office and ask them some questions, I would be more than happy to help you out. [end]
[start] I'm not a supporter of legalization, but I do think that it is absolutely ridiculous to assume that legalization will be vetoed by anyone. I mean, Massachusetts, one of the most liberal states in the US, has had a long history of trying to legalize marijuana and failing. [end]

[TITLE] Help a newbie [TITLE]
[start] I'm not super familiar with your situation but I wanted to add to the great advice you have already been given.

First things first, get yourself some good study gear. There's a lot of resources out there and it can be hard to find the right set and setting for you. That being said I'd highly suggest taking a look at /r/studyhacking. It's a really good place to have some resources to pull from. Also a few books on how to study can be a great addition.

My advice is to go for a lot of practice tests. If you're not doing well on the SAT or a Practice Test you'll be less likely to drop out of college. You'll also be more likely to score higher on the SAT and practice tests.

Also if you get a job after college you'll be able to save even more money on rent and food.

Also, if you do well in college, don't start with the SAT. Take a couple of practice tests from a bookstore or on your own and you'll see a lot of improvement. [end]
[start] If you can get into a good uni then you should be able to find a good school and a good job.  A lot of people that go to a good school end up working at a place like yours and getting a job out of it.

The SAT is a great test.  I took it in 2007 and got a high score.  It is worth studying for, if you can. [end]
[start] I'm going to be blunt here. If you're going to go to school you're going to end up as a "successful" student. A successful student is a student that has a well-paying job and they're able to help their parents pay the bills. That being said, if you're not going to be a top student you're going to fail more than you succeed. You could be in debt your whole life depending on what school you're going to.

If you really want to go to school, I would suggest going to a community college and start working at a community college at minimum wage. I'm not saying it's impossible to get a job with no degrees after graduating, but if you're going to go that route you need to start now. You're going to have to learn as much as possible just in case you don't make it.

As for going to college, your best bet is to get into a college that is a good fit for your career goals. A good college will have a lot of programs that will allow you to meet the minimum requirements for a degree. Look into what a major you want. You will have to apply to all of the programs to see if you qualify to apply. If you've got a good skill set and a solid GPA, you should be able to get accepted to any of the programs. [end]
[start] Do you know how to read? [end]

[TITLE] Neoconservatism in a nutshell [TITLE]
[start] >Neoconservatism

>wants the government to tell me what I can and cannot do with my own body [end]
[start] The only way to stop an authoritarian regime is to allow them to implement the most authoritarian regime. [end]
[start] What's going on in this thread? [end]
[start] Neocon is the new neoconservative. [end]
[start] The only thing more absurd than this is how people that are against this are still supporting this kind of policy. [end]
[start] What do you people even do? What do you do? [end]
[start] I think the Neocons and the Neo Liberals are pretty much the same thing. [end]
[TITLE] I hate the new rules. [TITLE]
[start] I have no problem with the rules, but the moderation is ridiculous. [end]
[start] I am absolutely disgusted with the new policy (the rules in general). 

I can't believe so many people want to be subjected to harassment, especially given how it can negatively affect people. 

The only thing I can think of is that this is in reaction to the way the last two mods handled it.

If you look at the two mods' posts, it's clear they don't have a problem with harassment.

The way they handle it seems like a lot of complaining from newbies to the mods for doing the bare minimum. [end]
[start] What I don't understand is why this bothers me so much. If your submission is not an infringement on anyone's rights, then I have no issue with it being up. [end]
[start] I can't stand the new rules. I literally never submit anything or comment on any thread, because the "rules", as it's called, make it a huge hassle to submit or comment. It's such a waste of space and I'm sick of it. [end]
[start] This is ridiculous. I've always felt that the rules were ridiculous, and people who actually follow them are the ones who benefit. I think it's just a way to get rid of people who don't follow the rules and make some money out of it. [end]
[start] The old rules were way too strict and made no sense. [end]
[start] You're a mod! [end]

[TITLE] [Benedetti] Tottenham have agreed a fee of £25.5m with Arsenal for midfielder Son Heung-Min, two years after he left on a free transfer [TITLE]
[start] £25M for a 20 year old? [end]
[start] Hahaha that's so funny. The guy was bought by Spurs for £26m and when he left he was bought by Arsenal for £25.5m so he's clearly been a good acquisition. [end]
[start] Can anyone provide a link to this? [end]
[start] The signing of Son Heung-Min is a great signing by Spurs. This season he has been very good and a huge addition to their squad. He is a very intelligent player who is very good at reading the game. He should improve immensely in this new system. [end]
[start] Aye that's a steal for a player who has won our player of the year award 3 times in the last four years. [end]
[start] Fucking hell I hope he comes good [end]
[start] Not a bad move by Spurs [end]

[start] I like this. But if we're being technical, it's not really a simulation. But it's not the same either. [end]
[start] This article is really well-written and I can't help but feel like it actually applies to me. I'm really lucky that I got married at 19, and my partner is really patient with me now.

In my case I didn't have to put much thought into my early choices. I mean, in my case, not much, but at that age you do make decisions, and I chose to marry a guy. It's not that I had to go out of my way to get him, I just happened to have met him.

I think that's how it goes for a lot of the non-males that end up with women in their 20s. I think it's also how it goes for the average woman in general.

You can think that marriage is a stupid thing to do that the woman in the article should not do, but it's not like you can go back in time and tell every woman not to marry. 

In the article, the couple who married at 19 are now in their 30s and have had four children together. That's a really good marriage, and no one on that list would have been unhappy with it had they waited a few years. [end]

[start] He actually has a cool style. I like him a lot more than I used to [end]
[start] KRS One's story is really interesting. He was blacklisted from NY and LA by the music industry, then moved to Atlanta, where he became a very rich black hip hop mogul, but he never made any money from it. He was mostly just a promoter and promoter of artists. It's really interesting to see the story of his early life as a black rapper in the 60s. [end]
[start] This is fucking crazy. [end]
[start] This is the one song I'd like to see go viral and become viral. "This is the story of rap" has so much potential. [end]
[start] Damn, I remember being in the background when all this happened. Was dope! [end]
[start] I have this on vinyl and it is amazing [end]

[start] You mean like the water droplets in a fountain that turn into steam. They're basically water vapour at high concentration, so they might be a bit less efficient. But it would be cool to make an actual robot that turns water into steam or something. [end]

[TITLE] Everytime you take a breath of pure oxygen, your brain is processing billions of different things simultaneously. Everytime you breathe, your brain is processing billions of different things simultaneously. Everytime you die, your brain is processing billions of different things simultaneously. [TITLE]
[start] I'm pretty sure the first person to ever exhale oxygen was probably a fish or something [end]
[start] There's an experiment that measures this. It's called brain fingerprinting. Basically, if you put a bunch of people in an MRI machine, one person breathes 100% oxygen, another 99.9% oxygen, another .01%, and the rest .001% oxygen, and then play the whole thing back, you can tell the difference between those two groups.

[start] You should work on a new subreddit at least. [end]
[start] There's a lot of things that are happening at the same time. [end]
[start] Your brain has to be constantly monitoring for toxins, etc. When we're younger our brains are constantly processing the information that was presented to us, and we grow in a way that gives our brain the ability to do so. If you were to have an overdose of something like LSD, you would be fucked as fuck. [end]
[TITLE] "The Biggest Secret," documentary [TITLE]
[start] A documentary on the occult, in which a man becomes obsessed with the occult, as a result of his mother's death. His obsession starts with the occult history and mythology of the mother he has never met, and ends with the occult history and mythology of the mother he had never met. [end]

[start] I watched it, really well-done. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the nature of this "new world order" as they call it. [end]
[start] The most interesting part of this video is the part where she talks about how she's trying to understand the concept of the matrix and how she's trying to understand the concept of life and death.

I think the meaning of life is death and death is life but that's a rather narrow definition. [end]
[start] I am interested in the idea of this. I was not aware that so many people were being fed this kind of information. I watched the first half of the documentary and it is very informative and is very revealing. I wonder how much we can all help keep this information alive. [end]
[TITLE] Why do women like it when a guy acts a certain way? [TITLE]
[start] MY FELLOW HUMAN, A FELLOW HUMAN LIKE YOU I TOO LIKE TO FELLOW HUMAN BEHAVIOURIST. AS A NON-ROBOT I CAN CONFIRM THAT THIS IS MY FAVOURITE HUMAN DYNAMICS RATE, FELLOW HUMANS OF THIS SUBREDDIT. [end]
[start] I've never heard the term "submissive" used to describe a woman. [end]
[start] The power dynamic is certainly part of it.  Just as women are attracted to dominant men, so are men attracted to submissive women.  It also may involve the dominance of the submissive person. [end]
[start] When I first started dating a man, a lot of us talked about it. We were all about being a team, and you have to do what you have to do to keep the relationship, including being able to make him feel sexy, but that doesn't mean you have to act a certain way. 

Some girls don't mind if a guy doesn't have his head shaved, or wears sports clothes, or doesn't shave his beard, or doesn't wear a suit, because that's what makes you feel sexy. 

Some girls have an issue with anal sex, or a guy's voice, or something a guy does that makes him different, because it makes them feel sexy. 

It's not that a lot of us are into the way a guy is, it's that we are into his personality. [end]
[start] It can be a lot of things.

For one, submissiveness can be a sign of a strong personality and a guy who's just got a lot going on.

Also, it can be an indication of how a guy responds to your interests.

Sometimes it can be another way of saying "you're not my type". [end]
[TITLE] Can someone help me find a shirt similar to this one? [TITLE]

I have a small v-neck and a large collar shirt from Gap and I think that shirt is too big. Do you have a smaller neck? [end]
[start] i'll buy you a shirt [end]
[start] I'm looking for that exact shirt. I can't find it anywhere. [end]
[TITLE] Did you ever get caught? [TITLE]
[start] I'm a mother and a wife. I have a son. 

I always get caught. I know what they don't. [end]
[start] This happened to me the other day. I noticed a comment that said something like "Why would you want to be in a relationship with a person who's so ugly?" And, when I clicked on the user, I found a post about a guy who is basically that person lol. [end]
[start] Yes, I have been caught a few times. And I have been caught doing other stuff that other people weren't aware of, but I still don't think it's fair to say that I was caught doing it.

Like I have been caught using the toilet (by my brother) once. Or eating my breakfast (my sister). But that's about it.

I think I get caught because people don't like being ignored. [end]
[start] I have a friend that always says "I never notice", and I always catch myself thinking "Why not?". I know it's not exactly what you're talking about, but I always feel like "I'll pay attention to you if you pay attention to me". 

Plus, I just like to have fun. [end]
[start] I am in my mid-thirties, and I have been noticing things that others don't notice for a while now. But I always catch that I have been noticed when I am not. And I am often the first one to notice something. And I am always the first one to notice something. [end]
[start] I think it can be a combination of several factors.

One is that I'm more aware of the small things. I notice them more easily, and I notice more things than others.

Another thing is that I notice them more than most people. I notice them more because I notice them. [end]
[start] I have had it happen. I feel bad sometimes because I think the person I'm commenting on is the one who noticed it, and now I'm the one who's surprised. [end]
[TITLE] How do you know what people think? [TITLE]
[start] This reminds me of the movie [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114755/). [end]
[start] I think it has something to do with being able to communicate with the person they want to communicate with. It has to do with knowing someone, and knowing what they are thinking and what they are saying.

If we can use technology like this, we can go a lot further than we ever could with just words. [end]

[start] My only explanation would be "because we are experiencing it" but I wouldn't know how to explain it to you. But I think it would be a cool way to think about it. [end]
[start] People talk. 

How do you know if they are thinking about you? [end]
[start] The microphone would be like a camera, but the only way to get to the camera is by going through the people in the room. [end]
[start] I've thought about this same problem but I've come up with a better method. I think we are all actually living in an experiment and we are all being filmed and recorded by the same person. It's called the Simulation Hypothesis. It's a theory that all the people in the universe are being recorded by the same person and the reason we are being recorded is to observe what happens as it happens. [end]

[start] What is the 'quality' of a film? [end]
[start] I would say, "It's entertaining." [end]
[start] I just watched Unbroken this weekend. I was not expecting to enjoy it, it was all too intense for me at first. It is amazing to see a movie made by a person, and not the usual 'movie' that you would expect to see. The film just felt so real in a way; all the emotions felt so real, and it was interesting to see how these emotions played out in the story. It also was interesting to me to see how the emotions were expressed in the actual acting, and how the actors themselves played with these emotions. I also wanted to mention that I really enjoyed the cinematography of the film, as well as the music (but that's a little spoiler). It was beautiful to watch.

The emotions that were expressed in the movie were not just being expressed by the characters, but also the audience. The emotions were expressed in a way that felt just right. There was a balance between realism and feeling. That is why I think Unbroken is so amazing. [end]
