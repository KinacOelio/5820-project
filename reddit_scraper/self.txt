[TITLE] I want to share something a friend posted that helps clarify what's going on in the US right now. The protests are not *just* about one isolated incident. This is about race. The issue goes far deeper than that and it can't be explained away that easily. [TITLE]
[start] Can you post references for stats and facts? [end]
[start] America has like the most militarized police in the world and the largest prison population. Even the racist and totalitarian Russian cops kill less people (mostly torture suspects to death during the detention, so victims will admit to crimes). Compared to America, actual African countries don't have huge budgets and a lot of police officers, yet still manage to have far less criminals. America is literally worse than the poor African countries when it comes to the society, competing only with Russia. The superpower is not super safe, no matter the amount of guns people buy each day. [end]

[start] Yeah but it’s easier for the media to say “race war lul” instead of doing anything constructive, and people eat that shit up. [end]
[start] The words "black lives matter" offend me because they are condescending and patronizing. They make it seem as if I am supposed to not already believe this. I am tired of being assumed to be a racist because I am white. As a result, I actually understand why black people would be angry that people assume they're dangerous because they're black.  White privilege does not exist. Black disadvantage does. If people keep trying to push shame and guilt onto white people, more people who used to not be racist, are going to become it, and there will be even more chaos. I won't be one of them, because I'm not a dumbass - but there are a lot of dumbasses in this country.  Also, the fact that everyone whines about anti-black racism while COMMITTING anti-white racism (and also, while ignoring the terrible oppressions occurring in countries other than America which are even worse than black people experience here - such as the occupation of Palestine by Israel), pisses me off. You can  decry the systemic racism in a system without blaming an entire race for it. [end]
[start] This shouldn't even be just about race! Don't get me wrong with black people only taking up 12% of the entire US population but accounting for as much as 30 to 50% of certain prison populations they are definitely disproportionately affected.  However it's our entire fucking system. Have you ever heard of the Tulsa massacre in Oklahoma. A very successful black town was pretty much destroyed because white people couldn't stand black people having success. Literally for Generations we have kept black people poor. And because of this and because of racism a lot of our laws were made to destroy anyone who was poor because they were the minority they were the people that you wanted to get rid of. We have quotes from presidents who have purposefully put in laws to teardown minority communities and make them into slaves in a prison house.  Here's the issue when 98% of all charges and employee agreements as a general average from the studies and statistics posted out. Certain local areas you can find some as low as 90% of all charges and in a plea agreement. Why?  Why would any innocent person sign a guilty paper?  Because as soon as you are charged with something in the United States before you even seen the judge you show up as if you are convicted. It's common practice for a district attorney to up your charges to felonies as soon as they hit their desk however they can. Before they have even seen you. You can get fired from your job because of that. You can be denied any reasonable employment because of that. And the district attorney can drag on the preliminary rounds for years until you just want to sign a guilty plea.  You can set in the jailhouse during the entire time these preliminary rounds are going on. And in my area if you decide to sit in the jailhouse so that way you can get a lawyer assigned to you because they won't if you're not sitting in the jailhouse. The state literally charges you 75 to $110 a day for maintaining you in the jailhouse. Let's say your bail was set to 3000. Your mother could pay a bondsman about 300 to 350 to go and bail you out. Oh but if she does that you're considered able to afford an attorney. It doesn't go off with pay stubs it doesn't go off of W-2s. It doesn't go off of anything else any other government programs such as food stamps energy assistance free lunches for your children or even college education. All of those government programs actually take pay stubs W-2 tax returns Etc. Not if you want a lawyer!  The laws are made to keep people down. They're made to make you pay. It's your guilty until you pay for innocent. You know all the politicians who have been noted for sexual issues a lot of the pedophile if she's were people had even been convicted but just go to another country for a few years and then come back and still work in Hollywood with children! How does this happen with their backgrounds it's because they paid it off!  Meanwhile a lawyer can cost 2 to $300 an hour. And a situation with the lawyer I had to get she wrote herself down as my lawyer before I had signed anything or done anything. No other lawyer would take me because in the documents and the county she was my lawyer. She wouldn't progress my case until I had paid for a full size thousand dollars. So the district attorney kept me in the preliminary rounds and kept kicking it down month by month. I still had to show up to the courthouse every single month just for them to stay after me waiting in line for hours with a bunch of other people because you can't show up whenever you have to show up at 9 a.m. and they might get to you by 2 p.m.  They just tell you come back next month we haven't done anything. Meanwhile they charge you for every single court date they have which they have to have every month. It's $80 each court date. Him down at the top so you can report this to your attorney general of your state but they're not going to do anything. Oh when you can file The Paupers affidavit to try to get a lawyer but that's determined by a judge. And they won't give you one! I have seen homeless people who are still sitting in the jailhouse denied lawyer! Merely because they didn't call the right ones when there's a list of 20 lawyer and they called 10 of them. But apparently not the right ones. This is a list that is posted in the jailhouse. Along with bondsman that are posted in the jailhouse.  Imagine going through all this all the wild charges of felony show up on your background you've lost your job but yet you're seeing is able to afford an attorney. This can go on for years! There's this one story of a man who killed himself because he was accused as a child of stealing a backpack and grew up in jail before they finally just dismissed all his charges because there wasn't enough evidence or anything. He had been so mentally damaged by the way they treated him he ended up killing himself a few years later. His family noticed that he never recovered socially.  But when we have had politicians and presidents literally Target minorities and make laws that would disproportionately affect minorities and how generally the rich people are white and can pay Off Their fines and pay for their innocence that is what this issue is about. But no one's fighting the lawyers or the judges.  No let's all just blame the cops and it's the individual cops problem not the states problem because multiple cops have killed people with these restraining procedures. But no let's only focus on these three cops that killed this one man and not focus on reforming the entire Justice System changing the way our judges lawyer's and everything work Arbonne system are jailhouse system and our police all at once. No let's just defund the police. If we do that we're just going to leave a lot of the private stores to only take care of their problem with their security forces and their police forces and then we won't have a police force to ever investigate them. As corrupt as our police force is it's because of a lot of the other system issues.  Our justice system needs to be burned completely and redone!  Oh also it's a really interesting fact that the pharmaceutical companies and medical companies in the United States have spent more than NASA has just for a lobbying to keep their prices high and hidden and everything else. This is why it cost us 17% of our GDP just to take care of the old people in our country. Also that and we see fast food as an essential service but not certain Medical Services. What a fucking piece of work. I can't wait till I'm dead or out of this country [end]
[start] These people are kind of bringing it on themselves though. They grow up being told that they are special and deserve everything, and whenever they don’t get what they want they call it racist. Many deal drugs for extra cash, then call it racist when they get pulled up and arrested. I’m not saying that white people are better, I’m saying that people should learn that illegal actions over several decades are *going* to start stereotypes about a certain type of person. Nobody is special, and *nobody* deserves anything. [end]

[start] Yes it is about race here in the USA. I don’t know why it has gotten so bad with Covid but it did. This is not the home I know [end]
[start] This is probably the scariest post ive read this entire year.   Why? Well due to monetary and political reasons, you can now with the help of technology manipulate/brainwash human beings into believing something false to be facts by creating fake “facts”.   We are sadly moving in the same direction as with the Salem witch trials. Where their excuse was ignorance and strong belief, ours is too much technology/information mixed with planted beliefs.   ....  After spending day in and out for the last 25 years digging into the subjects mentioned in the post and working closely with it. I will have to say that this entire post only contains   - A personal opinion. - Fabricated numbers. [end]
[start] Are we going to get any sources for the actual claims here? The only one of these that I have seen sourced elsewhere is the 1/1000 vs 39/100,000.   Also, why not present that as 100/100,000 vs 39/100,000? I think everyone is in agreeance that there is a racism problem within the US police force; we dont need to undermine the point by trying to make stats seem more incredible than they already are. [end]
[start] When you present an opinion and claim that its backed by facts, you have to source these facts from a trustworthy source. Why should I have to search for information when you're the one trying to convince me that colored people are getting discriminated against?  So far I haven't been able to find any documents that had any trustworthy documentation or refrences but it might be me idk.  Anyways while I definitely believe that there is racism in the states(I know because I lived in the states for 12 years before moving back to Korea), some of these facts sound ridiculous.  "White families hold 90% of the national wealth, black families hold 2.6%" - I couldn't find any source. But it is plausible considering only 13.4% of the population are colored folks. But you have understand it's only been 52 years since Mr.King died. You might think that it's a long time, but for a few centuries colored people were treated as sub-human by the majority of non-colored people and many of the caucausian younger generation at that time has grown to be an old man ingrained with those very same values. Considering that the majority of Americans are caucasian, you can easily predict the result of what would happen.  I absolutely think that there are things that have to be solved within society in the states but these changes simply can't happen in a short amount of time. There's a national crisis in the US at the moment and while I respect your noble cause, it's detrimental to the economy and stability of the country. That's my opinion but each to their own.  P.S y'all at the states should seriously impeach pancake face at the whitehouse. While Obama wasn't the best president, he still put the country and it's citizens as top priority. Meanwhile, the current president tear gasses his own citizens to take a picture of him holding a bible upsides down rofl [end]
[start] It's also historically aswell.  I'm a white person ok, I live in the UK - so I am privileged (but skint), but I have white privilege.  I have suffered from discrimination and stigma as have a mental health diagnosis of bipolar.  But that is only when people find out, and that is only when I'm in a situation where people are judgemental, so that is not, say walking into a shop, walking into a pub.  I only experience that, from a small minority of people, when I chose to tell them, and most nowadays (perhaps I'm better at choosing who I tell now) people have become more understanding of it.  &#x200B;  So my discrimination I have experienced, was only temperamental - I struggle to find employment (I get the interview, do well in some (most I do appalling), but they always find a reason not to hire me.  And because of the types of jobs I apply for, I have to disclose to them, but it's not required for me to disclose until I get the job offer, but cos I'm sick of getting the offer, and then they turn it down, I now put it on the application form in the supporting info bit such as 'I will tell you now rather than later, I have a mental health diagnosis.'  Because I'm sick of going through all the process, which for me, takes a lot of effort and stress, to be turned down at the last minute.   So I tell them straight up if I can, then I know I've got a better chance, and I know then it's something I've done wrong in the interview.  So I suffer discrimination that way.  &#x200B;  So if I imagine, and I cannot ever really understand, unless I was actually a black person, and a black person reading this might very well say, no it was nothing like that, because you don't really know until you have experienced it for yourself.  &#x200B;  But can you imagine being born, and then (even at 6mths old babies have the ability to smile back at you if you smile at them), that young ok - coming out of the safety of your family home, sitting in a pushchair, going to the shops.  Where a lot of people you see, strangers are not smiling at you.  And it happens and happens again, throughout your childhood, not just once a week, over and over again, whenever you go anywhere at school, or anywhere where their is white people,  How do you think that might be reinforced to a child?  That you are inferior.  Their parents might try to explain to a child or reinforce that they are special and that black is beautiful, but a young child might not fully understand.  And they just understand, that they are getting treated differently from white kids.  They see negative looks in people's eyes, when adults, and perhaps other children, look at them, and it's in their awareness.  But then on top of that - there is the knowledge, when they get a bit older, to understand how the colonists infiltrated Africa, and enforced their white supremacy onto black people.  Take South Africa for example, the apartheid, black people had all their rights removed.  They were not allowed to have insurance, they were not allowed to own their homes, they had to rent off a white landlord, they were only allowed to be slaves, for white people.  They had to live separately from white people.  And even when apartheid ended, it created even more problems as there were no jobs for them when slavery ended.  Not only that, they were denied an education, because white people decided to deliberately give kids, that would be at high school age at this point, having to recite the 2 times table.  Because white people didn't want them to become educated because they wanted to reinforce onto them that they are slaves.  But children grow up believing that they are inferior.  Yes their parents might be doing the opposite, but when the leaders of your country, and the white people that lived their was reinforcing it constantly, people actually believe that they are inferior as it has been drilled into them since the day they were born.  There parents might have still continued to believe they were inferior to white people.  Then white people forced Christianity onto them, white missionaries.  They were led to believe that Jesus was white with blue eyes, in Christianity Jesus is God, so they believed in God, believed in Jesus, and believed that God is white.  Reinforcing that , because of the colour of their skin they are inferior and that inferiority has come from God, because God is white with blue eyes.  &#x200B;  Then the slavery and the brutally that their slave owners gave to them, and I am no where close to what they might have experienced over and over again.  They would have been terrified of their slave owners no doubt.  They were nothing more than how we treat our pets, however, we love our pets and we don't make them work for us for us to get rich.  Then slavery got abolished.  The problems do not disappear overnight - the problems are present here today - and are no where near close to treating people with a little of bit of respect.  Trump comes to power, after their might have been a ray of hope when Obama came to power  - for a black person, can you imagine how amazing that must have felt to witness the first black president - and that's your black president in your country, who's intention wasn't to get involved in the Iraq war, which shadowed his time in office, his intention was to fight what he could for equality.  And he tried to do that with free health care for all.  Then Trump comes into power, people in the UK, white people were angry about that, but can you imagine listening to him and he's your president and you are black - can you imagine how that must feel.  I can feel angry at Trump, but I'm at a safe distance from him, in the UK, to not let it bother me too much.  So yeah, when black people see a white person, it reminds of them that we were the same colour as their oppressors.  And it's them that have to try really really hard each time, to keep themselves polite with us.  Because if it was me, I just couldn't do that I'd completely insane.  I could not cope with that level of anger they have suppress on a day to day basis when you look at how we have treated them for all this time.  &#x200B;  The Black Lives Matter is not due to one single event.  I don't understand why it's taken this long for them to start protesting, because what happened with George Floyd happens a lot in the US.  I didn't fully understand this until I read 'Just Mercy' by Bryan Stevenson a couple of years before.  I felt what happened to Eric Garner was even worse, because the trial went on for years, and the police got away with it and still work in the police force.  There has been loads of incidents similar to George Floyd - and I have only heard of  a small fraction of them,   Black people in America, are scared, on a day to day basis, that they might get shot down.  So that might be one of the reasons why it's taken so long for the pot to bubble over - out of fear perhaps.  I visited America just the once, and I felt scared, knowing people might be carrying guns.  Thinking all the time, be super polite, don't cause any bother, and I'm a white person.  I was terrified at customs in LA airport as that was the first time I'd ever seen a gun in real life (i'd only seen a gun on TV).  Trump goes on about the UK having a problem with stabbings.  Yes we have, but it's a small minority, and this small minority, the majority are kids, carrying knifes as they've got involved in smoking a bit of weed, feeling a bit scared as they've been introduced to other gangs that carry knifes.  Mostly the stabbings are within these gangs, the majority, so for me I feel safe to walk where I want without that worry.  If you live in a country when guns are just seen on tv, seeing a gun in real life, seeing someone carrying a gun in real life is terrifying for me.  In the US, that might not occur to mind because they are used them.  So yes, I'm glad I don't have to face what black people have to face, as I couldn't live day by day have to put on a lid on my rage that I feel.  And I have probably underestimated it, because I'll never ever really know how it feels and how it effects you because I have privilege, white privilege.  And I too, was led to believe, not from my mum, but from the media and how one of my school teachers treated the one black kid in my school, that black people are inferior.  For F\*\*k's sake - it's a skin colour due to different levels of pigmentation.  and knowing how ridiculous, the intolerance, of a different shade of skin makes us - and how dangerous and oppressive we have become.  I'm gonna stop here. [end]
[start] Disney will not allow a black character unless it is an animal?  This couldn’t possibly be because the majority of the US population has been Caucasian, could it?  Not saying Disney is not racist, because some of their depictions in their shows, but there are characters evolving now that are not exclusively Caucasian.  Maybe they were targeting a broad audience, without intending to marginalize a group.  Yes, there is room for growth, especially since we are in 2020, but to state they will not allow it without proof from Disney?  Far fetched. [end]

[start] And I quote Wikipedia:  >According to a study from the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Justice_Statistics)  from 2002 to 2011, among those who had contact with the police, "blacks  (2.8%) were more likely than whites (1.0%) and Hispanics (1.4%) to  perceive the threat or use of nonfatal force was excessive."[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-81)    >   >According to [*The Washington Post*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post),  police officers shot and killed 1,001 people in the United States in  2019. About half of those killed were white, and one quarter were black,  making the rate of deaths for black Americans (31 fatal shootings per  million) more than twice as high as the rate for white Americans (13  fatal shootings per million).[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-:1-82)[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-83) *The Washington Post* also counts 13 unarmed black Americans shot dead by police in 2019.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-84)    >   >A 2019 study by Cesario et al. published in [*Social Psychological and Personality Science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Psychological_and_Personality_Science)  found that after adjusting for crime, there was "no systematic evidence  of anti-black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of  unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of  harmless objects".[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-85)  However, a 2020 study by Ross et al. criticizes the data analysis used  in the Cesario et al. study. Using the same data set, Ross et al.  conclude that there is significant racial bias in police shooting cases  involving unarmed black suspects. This bias is not seen when suspects  were armed.[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-86)    >   >A study by Harvard economist Roland Fryer found that blacks and  Hispanics were 50% more likely to experience non-lethal force in police  interactions, but for officer-involved shootings there were "no racial  differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken  into account".[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-87)    >   >A study in [*PLOS One*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_One)  found "significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans  relative to unarmed white Americans" by police. The average bias measure  was that unarmed African Americans had 3.49 times the probability of  being shot compared to unarmed whites, although in some jurisdictions  the risk could be as much as 20 times higher. The study also found that  the documented racial bias in police shootings could not be explained by  differences in local crime rates.[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-88)    >   >A since retracted study in [*PNAS*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNAS)  claimed that black people were actually less likely than white people  to be killed by police, based off the death rates in police encounters.[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-89) A study published in the journal [*Nature*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)) that found such conclusions were erroneous due to [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox). The *Nature*  paper showed that it was true that white people were more likely to be  killed in a police encounter, overall black people were still being  discriminated against because they had far more interactions with the  police due to structural racism. The paper noted that black people have  far more interactions with the police per capita than white people, and  that black people tend to get stopped for more petty crimes or for no  crime at all. Conversely, white people tend to interact with police in  situations more rarely, and often in more serious crimes such as  shootings, where police are more likely to use force. Thus while it  appears that white people are killed at a higher rate, the datasets are  not comparable in such a simple fashion. The *Nature* paper also  backed up the findings of Ross and Fryer, and concluded that overall  rate of death was a much more useful statistic than the rate of death in  encounters.[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-90)[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-91)   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_Lives\_Matter#Police\_use\_of\_excessive\_force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#Police_use_of_excessive_force) [end]

[start] Hi [end]
[start] Holy. Your right It’s not about a few things it’s about all the things listed in the post. Weird how come the news hasn’t coved the actual facts. That means the media and news is just feeding the issue and not giving the right facts also called fake news [end]
[start] Big city police are deployed in high numbers to low-income African American communities. Why? Because that’s where most of the crime is. That’s where it has been since the 1920s, and especially since the 1960s. Such deployments were far less common prior to the 1960s, when black communities were severely under-policed. The result was impunity for many black violent criminals and, in turn, an incentive for black men to engage in more violence as a self-defense mechanism. The late 1960s changed this pattern. As black-on-white crime rose, police departments came under mounting pressure to control crime, much of which occurred in or near minority neighborhoods where it victimized black residents. African American violent crime rates soared between the 1960s and the early 1990s. During that period, in big cities, arrests of African Americans for homicide, the most accurate measure of violent crime, accounted for 65 to 78 percent of all homicide arrests. This is an extraordinary figure when one considers that the nonwhite population of these cities ranged from only 20 percent to a bit over 35 percent. The situation today has improved considerably. African American crime rates, and United States crime rates generally, have fallen dramatically. For all persons of all age groups, the homicide death rate fell 34 percent from 1990 to 2016. For black males in the same time frame, the decline was 40 percent. While violent crime has fallen, it nevertheless remains disproportionally high in communities of color. The latest police data collected by the FBI indicates that blacks comprised 58 percent of all murder arrests and 40 percent of those apprehended for all violent crimes. This disproportional involvement of African Americans in violent crime turns out to be the most significant factor of all in explaining the use of force against blacks by police. It will be no surprise that violent criminals in the United States are commonly armed and dangerous. For assaults, for instance, 71 percent of arrested persons carried firearms. Among suspected murderers, 58 percent had guns, as did 42 percent of apprehended robbery suspects. This tally doesn’t include the knives or blunt instruments recovered from violent offenders, including over 48,000 cutting instruments possessed by those arrested for assault alone. Police, of course, are well aware of this situation. Charged with a duty to apprehend offenders, they are—and must be—prepared to use force. Confrontations, often armed confrontations, in these circumstances are inevitable. Such confrontations will frequently involve white police and black suspects. Whites are a declining proportion of police departments in the United States, but they’re still close to half the force in big-city departments where white males make up 44 percent of full-time sworn officers. The Chicago Study As it turns out, when it comes to the use of force, the race of the police officer may not be significant. A study of 270 police shootings in Chicago from 2006 to 2014 found that the demographics of the officers who fired their weapons matched the demographics of the police department. Whites were 51 percent of the shooters and 53 percent of the force; blacks were 23 percent of the shooters and 25 percent of the force. In other words, there is no evidence that white police were more likely to discharge their weapons or that African American officers were less likely. This is especially noteworthy given the demographics of the shooting victims: 5 percent were white, 14 percent Hispanic, and an eye-popping 80 percent were black. Equally significant is the reason for the confrontation. In the overwhelming majority of cases (77 percent), the police were reactive, not proactive. They were responding, in the typical scenario, to a call about a violent crime. In the proactive situation (23 percent of the shootings), the officer initiated the contact, e.g., stopped a suspicious person. [end]
[start] One word, Fascism. What you see today isn't a product of a single event, this has been going on for years, way before most of us were born, this system is a process, a process with a current goal that's set up to make us all dependent on a government, to demoralize us and rid us of knowledge and understanding, fill our minds with rubbish and what they've done is create a human breed that's disconnected from reality, people are in denial and they will be untill a tragic event happens in their lives. Both political parties have plenty of flaws but the same agenda, starts with demoralizing a nation, destabilizing and then a sending a crisis, after this crisis with a violent change in power comes the normalization stage. People know your history or be doomed to repeat it! We need a revolution, a radical change, such change doesn't come peacefully just look at the past! Thank you for sharing your post OP, reddit is probably our last source of useful information gathered from average people not big corp like Google and whatnot. A time is coming where people are rising, people who are NOT afraid of death, people who will take it upon themselves to fight, to raise other leaders and warriors, we must remain mentally strong, not let fear control our minds, thoughts, lives and relationships. We need to grow emotionally, people have become so hurt and offended that a single look at someone taken the wrong way can result in death! Why? Who is responsible? ALL OF US JUST AS MUCH AS THOSE WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT AND SERVE. So many people don't know the constitution and it's role, the same people don't care, yet only start to care when they're affected somehow, and that's usually too late. Ideological subversion is a legitimate process and this isn't just happening in our country this is a global event and it seems as if those NWO conspiracies are starting to make sense. I still have hope because it's hard to accept that at the root of humanity there is so much evil and hatred. [end]
[start] Race is the face of another problem, an arguably worse problem in a way: the face that extremist Republicans refuse to accept Democrats or liberals as human. Like Lindsay Graham said, you can be black in SC “if you’re conservative”. [end]

[TITLE] there is nothing more worse in this world than seeing your mom cry [TITLE]
[start] I miss my mum ❤️ [end]
[start] That’s the fucking worst, I’ve never seen my father cry so I don’t really know how it feels but when my mom cries I just can’t do anything but sadness.   It sucks for me that it takes my mother to cry in order for me to show some emotion. [end]
[start] Especially when it’s because of you [end]
[start] My mom died of brain cancer 4 years ago. This post reminded me of one of my saddest memories.  After 3 brain surgeries in a year to remove tumors, she was messed up physically and mentally. Was just a withered shell of her former self, a powerful human and pillar of strength for me and my sisters.  One morning when i was helping her eat breakfast, she broke down crying... saying how she will miss my sister's wedding (sister had just gotten engaged), never see her grandchildren, won't be there to make my sisters wedding gown (and boy could my mom sew!)... you know that howling cry...  I broke man. Fuck it was harsh...   My mom was in her last days, at home with us to live out the rest of her time with family. She was a nurse, she knew it was not going to turn around. I believe this was that moment of realization for her. She passed away a month later. [end]
[start] Seeing my child cry is worse. [end]
[start] Unless it’s crying from happiness [end]
[start] The only thing worse is seeing your dad cry. At least for me [end]
[start] Not if your parents were abusive assholes [end]
[start] I think there’s something very human about watching our parents cry. We always think they’ll be the ones to dry our tears, not the other way around. Is everything okay? [end]
[start] The animals that were hurt by children.  But that has more anger mixed with it. [end]
[start] True date, and somehow it happened everytime I try to talk with her about her problems with living alone and her potential alzheimer. That's tough [end]
[start] For me it sucks but in a different way. I feel next to nothing. My parents did the bare minimum to keep me alive, and while yes, I can see my sppent all her time in college or working to try and be financially independent, all she's done is put us in that special kind of poverty where you can't get welfare but you live paycheck to paycheck. She used me as a bargaining chip in the divorce and is trying to gaslight me about that being the case, she had me read her college books to her when her text to speech app didn't work, and after having almost nothing to do with me til I was thirteen, barged into my life and became a helicopter mom, invading my privacy three times over 2 years, and trying to cut all my communication with anyone other than members of the LDS church.  I'm bisexual.  Now she's a Trump supporter and believes that the CoVid vaccine is going to have a microchip that will mark us with the mark of the beast and damn us to total control by the government.  She's my mom. Everyone is supposed to love their moms, but I can't fucking stand her. This woman invalidates me at every turn and acts like it's for my own good, emotionally manipulates me and outright lies to there about it, wants me to follow the plan she made for my life with no regards to what I want, and I can't fucking stand it. I feel like aonster for hating my parents. [end]
[start] Try having your mom die.  Edit: don’t actually [end]
[start] Your experience is not universal. [end]
[start] Yeah I’ll never forget my mom’a face when I woke up after overdosing [end]
[start] Proper timely post OP.  Mum and I had a small argument and I haven't phoned her for a few days. Made me realise I shouldn't be so petty and give her a ring and tell her I love her.  Thanks. :) [end]
[start] Even worse is when she’s crying because you are a shitty son and failed her at growing into a promising man. [end]
[start] Ya, it's awful. Especially when I'm the cause...that being said, it rarely happens [end]
[start] Ive never seen either of my parents cry. [end]
[start] Yeah not always. Not everyone has a good relationship with their parents. For me, it’s far worse seeing my boyfriend cry [end]
[start] Seeing your mum in pain while dying is the second worst but seeing your mum take her last breath is actually the worst. Trust me. [end]
[start] When my mom dies I don’t know what I’ll do. I’m moving out on my own in 6 months and I’m just cherishing the time I have left living with her because I know visits will be few and far between. She’s done everything she can to support me through life and school. I just hope I can take care of her when the time comes. She’s a joy, a pain in my ass, and a fierce woman. I wish everyone could have a mom who instills in them the confidence and love my mom has for me. Her mom basically pushed her into marriage and quitting school at 19 and she made sure to teach my sister and I to be self sufficient, get our education, and never to rely on a man. [end]
[start] The first time I saw my Mom crying was sitting in her bedroom alone in her ranch house bought with what she could get for the family house my father purchased for us before their divorce. I had heard it before and I knew she cried. I saw it in different ways, but this was genuine.  I walked into the room and asked what was wrong so she just looked up and put out her arms for me and I came to hug her until she stopped. At least until she had cried with me enough and she said, "Thank you." I then went to the bathroom and did my nightly routine. I thought about it a lot.  There is a feeling you get that connects you to the brokenness in people when you see them hurting but it's an empty feeling that falls away for a moment when you can share that pain with them. I felt lifted, knowing she was calming because I was there.  I don't know if my being there was soothing, I don't know if she was crying for my sister and I. I do know it was just after an argument with my dad about us and I know she was comforted by my presence and that's a good feeling which makes this an okay memory.  She was a strong woman with an enormous heart and she did everything she could to hold herself together for us. She may be the reason I always feel the need to hold or be near anyone who's hurting. I know I can't stop their pain. I can always be there to let them know I care they feel it.  Her heart always showed in the people she took into her home. She had a family of friends with us when they needed it. She let our short-time stepdad have his Navy friend live with us shortly instead of paying crazy rent. She also let my sister's friends live with us when they had trouble at home.  She taught me to care about who people are and what they need when we are able to share. To see that woman cry was like being stabbed through the heart. I miss her. I never felt the need to thank her for everything she taught me and that will haunt me forever. [end]
[start] i’ve seen grandma cry once and it was the scariest, mom was in the OR i automatically thought she’d died or something happened. she pulled through thankfully. grandmas had 14 siblings go before her, she’s the last surviving one of her family, the woman is a rock. [end]
[start] my mom crying is the only time there’s ever any proof she actually feels anythi g [end]
[start] The grammar in that sentence is far worse [end]

[start] Y’all are awesome, thanks! [end]
[start] Good luck! [end]
[start] There needs to be like a upvote tax when posts like this happen like the dog or cat tax. You mention your dog/cat? You are now pressured to post a pic of that pet.  So, tax time: what are you trying to post to? [end]
[start] I see this all the time and I always uploaded to help people out with their Reddit experience because I love this place. It's kind of like my country I don't always agree with it but I don't want to be anywhere else. With that I have to wonder why there is a karma requirement to get into any sub? Does the sub want to prove that you're an actual participant and not a lurker in order to participate? [end]

[TITLE] I got rid of all of my social media (besides Reddit) and it has improved my mental health significantly [TITLE]
[start] Same here! I originally did it to escape the nonstop election drama but have decided to extend the hiatus. Much more peaceful. [end]
[start] Me too! It would get me down when my online friends wouldn’t tag or mention me in posts/tweets etc... I feel much better without social media. [end]
[TITLE] I feel like school at some point is just egging you to kill yourself/drop out. [TITLE]
[start] >I plan to work in fucking IT...  I hate to be that old fogey, but slow your roll.  You're just 17.  You may plan to work in fucking IT, but in another five years you may change your mind.  Statistically speaking, it's almost inevitable.  Three out of every five 30-year-olds are working a job they never saw themselves doing as a 17-year-old.  You need to learn as much as you can so that if you should ever change your mind about what you want to do, you'll have options.  That includes learning hard subjects. [end]
[start] You're in 11th grade, but you are already writing off the things you are learning because you won't need them. That's pretty narrow minded and also untrue. You just *think* you don't need them. But as an adult, I can tell you that you do. You really do need to have at least a basic understanding of this stuff. If you don't, the rest of your life will be immeasurably harder. Sure, nobody is going to ask you to solve physics equations at work. But having a general understand of how physics works will help you understand how the world around you works. Do I remember all those equations? Hell no I don't. But I remember the bigger concepts that physics teaches. And that knowledge helps me every day at both work and at home. [end]
[start] Why did you post on this sub if you don’t want advice. I’d recommend r/offmychest. [end]
[start] The people who didn't need biology / physics / math in high school are the Anti vaccers / moon truthers / MLM peddling mouth breathers of today.  Knowing things about the world that surrounds us informs our intuition when making everyday decisions. [end]
[start] School teaches you a lot about life because it confronts you with hard situations. Dont only judge the worth  of your educational system based on the scientific content it provides, because it teaches you so much more than that. Always see tough situations as possibilities for self growth. [end]
[start] I hated middle school, didn't enjoy high school, liked college, and enjoyed grad school.  High school is just a short period in life. Try to have some fun while setting yourself up for a future you want. [end]
[start] Bro I have been there 3 years ago. Stay strong soldier, after highschool choose a path of life that you want and you'll be happier. [end]
[start] Cry us a river. Most of us have been through school without throwing public tantrums. They are attempting to make you well rounded and less ignorant. It may not be working in your case. [end]
[start] Sometimes, life is just about getting from Point A to Point B so that you can be set to get to what you really want to do.  If you screw up too much in high school, it will just make college harder.  Do your 25 year old self a favor, and just do high school.  College really is better. [end]
[start] That sounds like a flaw in your educational system more than anything. Personally high school for me was pretty laid back because I knew what I wanted to do, I only signed up for classes I cared about and did enough to graduate. I didn't take difficult science and math classes because I knew it was completely pointless for my future.   Sorry you feel this way but school can be tough for sure. [end]
[TITLE] Is it odd to feel a little sad on your birthday? [TITLE]
[start] Growing up is complicated. The older you get, the more bittersweet there is in the sweet but it’s not bad or wrong to feel what you feel. You still have a lot of joy and excitement waiting for you. [end]
[start] Wait till you hit 23 lol. Jokes aside, it’s super common! I think it comes from building up this expectation to have the best day of the year; nothing’s supposed to go wrong. You’re young though, just spend the day doing whatever makes you happy with whoever makes you happy. Happy birthday! [end]
[start] Ive felt a little sad on every birthday since I was about 13. I don't know, but every year was just another time to lament my birthday. Its maybe because as a family we started to experience a lot of death when I was younger. Uncles, aunts, and general greif. Also since then ive lost my father and grandmother. Im 23 now, and my mother is approaching her 70s. Im usually not out with friends either because my b-day falls in the beginning of february in the midwest. No one is doing anything on those days. Unless there's an entourage of people, or something that keeps you close with people who actually remember your birthday. I just never saw the need in caring too much about it. Yet when the day falls, I end up reminiscing, and that will usually bring us back to recanting our life up to that point... which can bring about many feelings, sometimes sadness. [end]
[start] You're just about at the end of the fun ones. Eventually birthdays just become oldness reminders. [end]
[start] Depends on the reason.  Soon I will feel sad, firstly because   1. I will be one year closer to 40 2. I will be alone 3. After Corona I will only have my parents and only two friends to celebrate with 4. I try to not drink alcohol for the rest of the year, so I will not even be able to artificially lift my mood.  Dude, your fine :) [end]
[start] Happy bday!! [end]
[start] Humans are the only ones who mark the day they were born and count how many years “old” they are.  I know a lot of young people who are in their 60’s and a lot of old people who are in their 30’s.  Age is really in our minds and attitudes.  Our dogs are happy just to be.  Let’s be glad to just be, regardless of how many days we’ve been (human) being.  Happy Birthday, young one! [end]

Then, close your eyes and start thinking something random like dogs or art, and reflect on all the memories you have on that subject, and everything you like about it.

[start] I'm happy for you, I hope I'll find something similar in the future.  Thanks for posting this :) [end]

[start] This is very uplifting to read and I am extremely happy for you both. I am sorry that u guys of what u guys went thru. I wish something similar happens to me sometme [end]
[start] Having an unlikely relationship like this only gets weirder. If you have kids you’ll look at them regularly and just gasp at how their lives almost didn’t happen but for a series of coincidences. [end]
[start] Damn that's so sweet, hope your future is bright and happy! [end]
[start] I am so happy for you. I too have met someone who had a similar childhood as me. I never thought I would. I was in a relationship for over six years that ended rather abruptly and without any real closure. It really messed me up. I didn't think I'd ever find anyone. Especially not someone who is so sensitive and understanding. Last night he really opened up to me. He said he's scared because I'm making him feel things he hasn't felt in a long time. It's making him feel vulnerable. And I told him that's okay and I appreciate him sharing with me. He cried, he's never had someone been okay with him sharing and I'm just so happy he wants to. I feel like that's such an important part of a relationship and was really missing in my last one. Anyway, I digress, I know what an amazing feeling it is you're describing 💖 [end]

[start] reading this gave me hope. i'm a straight high school dude who likes anime. been single for more than 3 years now and i dont think i'll ever find anyone. i consider myself extremely ugly and i'm extremely lonely. i'm not rich and i have parents who "try" but at the end of the day ik shit about them that i dont think i'll ever forget. my biological dad has 2 wives, im the son of the first one. i live with my mom and step dad and even though anybody lesser than me would consider this a great household, but i dont. they fight all the time and ik some shit about my mom which idk man... at this point i just want someone to make me feel loved. i have dreams where i finally found the love of my life, and maybe im just overthinking everything, after all i have my whole life ahead of me. most of my friends are single and we're young so idk why me, out of everyone is just so sad. i'm legit sad all the time, outwardly i laugh all the time and im a happy guy but truly im always just sad. as i said, i just wanna meet someone and feel loved. feel needed. oh and dont even get me started on my friends. i have a handful of friends whom i regularly talk and many school "friends". like man these people always act like they're my friends but never act like it. i mean legit 2 people whom i thought were actually my "friends" had their birthday a few days ago and invited everyone except me, ik pandemic and all that but if ur inviting everyone they why leave me out? im so lonely that i never get wished on my birthday. idk man, life's just funny. i just wish i find happiness, wealth, true friends and the person im looking for.

[start] When i was in primary school a jeanator worked there, he was a redhead and from infant on i had a thing for redheads. I dunno why. AND for hands. Deep down i new i would recognize 'the one' by his hands.  Till this day i remember thousands of hands, incl Richards. The Jeanator was called Richard. I never knew anything about Richard expect f or his f irst and last name. Ffwd. My primary school had a reunion. My dad is a narcisist and didnt want me to go. I never was allowed anywhere without supervision. Because of te reunion i visited the website and i started  chatting with someone who went there. We never used a webcam, just chatting. He gave me his profile name so we could chat in his private account.  I scrolled through his pictures, he didnt have selfies, and suddenly this 'hand picture'comes along! Omg i had found him.  I ask him about the picture and he says: its just me.  He dcided he wouldnt visit the reunion so i didnt had the chance to see him.  Ffwd we met( although my dad forbid me) and he turnes out to be redhead. He was the Son of Richard.   I honestly never saw him or his sister before, although we visited the same school. He is 2 years older than me. My mum always spoke to his mum. We had to jump 25 years until we met.  My mum had a boyfriend before she had the ill fated meeting with my dad. This boyfriend was called Richard. After he coulndt have my mum, he comitted suicide. My grandfather, i never met him, but i still believe that he pulled some strings, together with the ex boyfriend, to give me the man i need. To get away from my father. [end]
[start] your little family sounds so lovely :) this gives me hope for my bf and i as i have always felt this way about him. it’s a blessed feeling [end]
[start] Seeing posts like this gives me hope I'll find someone for me one day too. [end]
[start] That's so sweet,it's just what I yearn to find one day. Thank you for sharing that such things happen and are not just fiction. [end]
[start] Maybe there's just more people your actually compatible with than you originally thought? I mean 7 billion+ [end]
[start] Same. I think it's because both of us stopped looking and the one popped up.   It's a wonder how we would settle for when looking?   Like as if I wanted corn, I'd look for it in the aisle of corns, there's something else that I'd like even better on the other aisle, but I didn't realize it yet. [end]

[start] >"fired" me a couple of sessions later.  Whats that mean?  Also I wont say there's something wrong with you, cause that might feed into the way you've described yourself. Someone important to me told me that feelings change and not even I can walk through this life believing that I will always feel a certain way. My memory also isn't "super human" like yours so I can't remember how I have felt at every interval in my life either. I mean at this point you should see your perceived mental disorder as a super-power, that may fulfill the emptiness (lack of confidence), that's stopping you from just changing how you react in certain situations to garner different results. Just like someone who has never trained in a martial art or mastered a skill, it may just be you lack the skills to connect with people, or the drive to see it through, and the lack of patience to listen without judgement. This is ok though, none of those things are disorders... there just choices, and we act them out in whatever way we want. We sometimes end up telling ourselves that they are co-inhabited by mental disorders, but a self diagnosis, and were just playing real life theater. I usually go to the gym to manage my impulses tho, or just vigorously do push ups.  We all have our coping mechanisms. [end]

[TITLE] I think people created God to make sense of the world and everything else around them [TITLE]
[start] Not just God but all religions. It helps humans make sense of why bad things happen and also why good things happen. People want a purpose and meaning to their existence. We do not want to accept that we are just like any other animal... We are born, live and die. [end]

[TITLE] Just received a medical bill for over $1000 [TITLE]
[start] Figure something out before they send it to collections and mess up your credit.   Most hospitals have something called charity care or sliding scale whatever they want to call it.   It's extremely rare anyone pays that full cash amount. Usually people that don't have insurance just throw the bill in the trash.  If you are eligible for medicaid they will even cover medical bills going a couple months back usually. [end]
[start] Call the place that sent the bill and tell them your circumstances. If you're uninsured, they'll give you a discount. If you're insured, they may settle for less or you can get on a payment plan [end]
[start] It might help to ask them for an itemized bill. I’ve seen hospital bills “magically decrease” by a lot when people ask to actually see that particulars of what they are being charged for. [end]
[start] Do you have medical insurance and the insurance company will shoulder the cost? Usually the annual premium at 2-3% of the total benefit.  Ex. Maximum Benefit Limit covered for 12 months at U$ 2,000. The Annual Premium for only $40-60 that’s equivalent to $3.33 - 5 per month. Depending on the type of plan. [end]

[start] Hey. I can sympathize with you as I was in that exact situation and still kind of am. The amount of despair I felt at the start of this year was something else. It's a horrible feeling and I know exactly what you're going through. PLEASE try not to think of yourself as dumb or that you fucked up your life. Mistakes are made by everyone! It's easier said than done though, I know, but the saying is true: you are your own worst critic. Going through your profile you seem like a good person with a fun sense of humour and a lot to offer. If you haven't already, I would suggest therapy. It can be nervewracking, and I'd be lying if I told you it's cheap (if you don't have coverage). But to get an outside perspective and advice could be very helpful. Just understand that there are options for you that you haven't discovered yet. Sometimes it can take a lot of searching, other times these things simply fall into your lap. Anyway, from one anonymous stranger to another, sending ALL the support! Good luck. Things WILL work out, just not the way you might think they will. [end]

[TITLE] DO NOT IGNORE ME PLEASE! HELP! [TITLE]
[start] Your post makes complete sense to me, probably because I have OCD and have had periods where my OCD basically controlled me. Okay so from what you said it sounds like you know that your compulsions aren’t reasonable and are trying to get control which is a positive thing. To be honest with you the number of times I’ve resisted a compulsion can be counted on one hand. I’m just going to jot down some thoughts about your post. - You resisted a compulsion (to go home and get the napkins). Your OCD sounds severe so resisting a compulsion is a big deal and I can say from experience that there have been times I literally thought I would die if I ignored my compulsion. - Your relationship with God(s) is yours and only yours. Everyone’s beliefs are very different but I would recommend that you try and address your God (perhaps through prayer); this might help you to stop worrying that you broke your promise without meaning to. - I’ve never made a promise to God that I would ignore a compulsion. I have negotiated at times with an abstract OCD entity in order to be allowed to exchange one compulsion for another. But it never occurred to me to promise to God or anyone that I would not do a compulsion because I know that I won’t be able to keep that promise. - I think the guilt and suffering you felt from not obeying the compulsion made you unconsciously punish yourself by putting you in doubt about whether or not you had broken your promise. - My advice would be to avoid making those types of promises. - The promise you made turned into a compulsion in itself (repeating the words over and over). It seems like another way to let the OCD torture you. - Plus “no turn” is ambiguous because it means no turning around and going home but you’re left wondering it turning your body slightly is a breach of the promise. - Personally I don’t consider you broke your promise because God knows what you meant when you made your promise.  My advice: don’t make promises because it leads to more pain. If you’re suffering badly please try to find another way to deal with the obsessive compulsive thought. I know it sounds obvious but the only thing that helped me was medication and psychotherapy. I wasn’t able to reduce those thoughts on my own. I hope your pain can be alleviated soon. OCD made my brain feel like it was breaking at times and it made me waste a lot of time and even hurt myself. Please don’t just try to tolerate it if it’s that bad. [end]

[TITLE] What motivates you to live and do the things you do? [TITLE]
[start] No doctor or therapist,  BUT, ask your therapist if they could have you try a different medication (SSRI or not) since (some) SSRIs/anti-depressants can make both good/bad, positive/negative feel MEH or neutral. The goal should not be for you to be apathetic, it's better than feeling depressedm, yes, but should ultimately be a step towards an end goal, not the end goal itself.  >Food is nothing but a nuisance for me.   Do/did you have any preferences in food or would you be open to try healthier meals? It's crazy how connected our gut (biome) is to our brian and how we feel.  You shouldn't feel bad about yourself if all you're living for is your son. That is NOW, who knows what'll happen in the next couple of years. People without kids watch ongoing tv shows, play games as a service video games or wait for the next book in a series to get them through the day, particularly the hard ones.

[TITLE] Trumpism makes me understand how Hitler seized power [TITLE]
[start] Absolutely. You have his followers who would follow him anywhere. But you also have a lot of people on the middle and left who have such complacency in our democracy and can't imagine how it could be ever taken away from them. Even when it's being attacked in the open right in front of their eyes. And people on the right who just care for a short term win regardless of the cost. [end]
[start] Hey, I wonder if you're getting any death threats. As a result of my one thread, I got one guy IM'ing me death threats. I blocked him and another IM from a different account came again threatening me.  Besides the multitude of childish insults these idiots throw at you, their mindests is "if you don't like our cult leader, you need to die."  These are nazis. Plain and simple. [end]
[start] Yup, I've read a few articles - this is EXACTLY how it started.  The trump people are seriously disturbed. Never mind the thousand childish insults, I'm literally getting death threats. Like someone is going to come get me - through reddit.   The dumbest mother fuckers alive these Trumpers [end]
[start] And those who could see what was happening could not stop it. [end]
[start] I don’t know where all this animosity for Democrats/liberals comes from. It’s the party that supports bringing people up, not holding them down. When was the last time a democratic president actively tried to disenfranchise Americans? I have a long list of all the work Republicans/conservatives have done to keep people in this country down. The party that pushes the narrative they’re “fiscally conservative” spends more than Democratic presidents, mess up our national debt, then always turn the country over to a Democratic President to fix. When was the last time a Democrat tried to disenfranchise voters? Or find away to take something necessary like healthcare away? Having a hard time remembering? That’s because it doesn’t happen. Saying Democrats and Republicans are the same just isn’t true - Look at the actions Republicans have taken over the last decade and you will see it’s a party driven by the rich elite to make their lives better at the cost of the average American. Yet Americans still vote for Republicans. It baffles me. [end]
[start] I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes for this but I'd like to point at that not every trump supporter are those wacky cult types, only the extreme and crazy ones are, but I do agree its interest to see how easily people idolized and follow others no matter what they say [end]
[start] Hi there. I'm German and my boyfriend and I talked about exactly this today. It's scary how evil people come to get such power. I hope the US gets to have a smooth transition in January and that your new president will be able to unite the people.     To quote a very important sentence for us germans: 'Nie wieder.'  'Never again.' [end]
[start] I got a few degrees in history and studied WW2-and Hitler’s popularity is described as the cult of personality. And I completely agree with you - we are witnessing the cult of personality happen in our lifetime. It’s difficult to stomach-especially when other characteristics like casting doubt of journalism and spewing “fake news” that has been happening as well. And while I agree not all Trumpers are Nazis but there are parallels between how Hitler rose to power and how Trump handled his term as president. The true test is whether he will transition out peacefully. [end]
[start] I have been thinking the same thing! Holy fuck. [end]
[start] What I don’t understand is how we can see so clearly what is happening and other people just as intelligent can’t?  That baffles me. I cannot understand their blind loyalty to a person who is a liar and a cheat and whom they themselves disliked before he entered politics. Can someone explain that to me? [end]
[start] Every time I go to work I realize how Hitler seized power, the same way my cruel bosses did. He didn't open with exterminating jews, he eased into it and just didn't like them. And people already didn't like them. So like right now how we just don't like when people get healthcare and fair wages. And then the Republicans really ram that stuff home. We're already there. We've moved from sharecropping peasants in the dark ages to more comfortably situated wage slaves in the digital age. [end]
[start] (This was a response to another comment, but the hate being thrown around in some of the comments has prompted me to just put it in the thread; downvote if you will but I hope everyone will take a moment and give it some real thought).   I do think it's important that our decisions and beliefs come from both a place of rational, and one of *understanding*  We can talk for hours, about what awful, *evil* people republicans are, but when you get right down to it, that just isn't always the case. There are foolish, awful people on both sides of the equation. I say this as a Democrat, and as someone that would never vote for a man like Trump. I'm sure there are a disproportionately large number of republicans that act disgustingly, and embody everything we hate about Orange man (without a doubt), but I'm tired of pretending like there aren't Republicans who are genuinely good people, either simply uninformed, or misled into believing they truly are doing what's right  The best example I can think of is my grandmother. My Grandmother is one of the sweetest women I have ever met. She would give you everything she owns in an instant, and pray you find Jesus the whole time lol. She is kind, loving, caring--and I'm convinced--genuinely wants the best for every kind of individual. This woman voted for Trump. I can't even talk politics without arguing with her as she believes some of the most ridiculous things are what's best for the future of our country.  My grandmother has been raised to believe what she does her entire life. She loves everyone around her, but has been so mislead and brainwashed that she believes she's doing what is best.  I think the important takeaway here is that I would never attack her character. I know she is a good woman, that has unfortunatley been led to believe  some things that are very backwards and frankly a contradiction to the woman she truly is.  I understand the hesitancy to try and interact (much less understand) people that seem so frustratingly ignorant or awful, but I urge you to give a bit more consideration when it comes to how we view people on both sides, for the sake of progress, peace, and for the sake of our country.  Someone else said something I liked; We are human beings before we are members of a political party. I just hope everyone can remember that. [end]
[start] Lügenpresse ~ “lying press” was something Hitler would say about the newspapers he disagreed with. That’s one thing you should remember next time a trump supporter praises trump for “exposing the fake news”. [end]
[start] The Holocaust Memorial Museum in DC starts out with the rise of Hitler and the cultural and historical events that led to him taking power.  It was terrible, horrifying, step by step, drip, drip, drip...  We are never far from it happening again.  In fact, it is happening again. [end]
[start] Not just Trumpism. This crazy fuckin charged up attitude is just as rampant in the left. If you can’t see what the media has done to everybody, even narratives you align yourself with then you are blind. Everyone needs to calm down.   We are fellow humans before we’re any political party. Anyone notice how it sucks to be anybody these days?   People in power want that. Their plan is working. We are falling for it. [end]
[start] TDS 😂🤪 [end]
[start] Hitler was elected in a dictatorship. He had full control of the country and nobody could really stop him. Trump was elected in a republic, where he didn’t have all the power. He was actually able to be impeached, but he did not pass through the senate. Trump has done good and bad things, that’s why he has supporters and haters. Hitler had supporters since everyone was powerless against him. These are two very different things. [end]
[start] Wow this r/self had been real political lately. Hmmmm [end]
[start] Honestly, it's just baffled me. Hitler was a horrible person, but he was also crafty and a gifted orator. He knew what people wanted, and he could deliver in a very wiley way. The more I learn about Trump, the more I realize there's nothing special about him other than the ability to know who to throw money to, no scruples about denying objective reality, and not paying anyone at all for anything. He's a dull, boorish, untalented halfwit who got rich and famous off failure.  Germany got played by Hitler. We got played by Trump. What does that make us? [end]
[start] Everything said in this post about the right is exactly said from the right about the left. But what interest me most is people don't acknowledge that very much but instead believe whole heartedly that they are right and the other is wrong.   I just breathe deeply and think this is why wars happen and there's nothing about human nature that will change. [end]
[start] Its fucking BIZARRE how people are behaving. It hasnt always been like this has it? [end]
[start] Guaranteed OP has 0 historical understanding of WW2 germany [end]
[start] What civil liberties have you lost? [end]
[start] This is a funny post, y’all are crazy 😂 [end]
[start] One method he takes straight out of Hitler’s playbook is the VAGUENESS. By being so incredibly vague and refusing to outline the evidence for the fraud he’s claiming exists, or even “make america great again” is straight proof of it. By doing this, his supporters can and will interpret these messages their own way, with the most extremist responses being rewarded with a retweet from the Dicktator himself! [end]
[start] I agree but not completely.  Hitler and Trump are sinisterly similar when it comes to the way they lure people in with promises and big dreams, with no real intention to ever deliver; their use of scapegoats and blame games are similar too.  However, Hitler had charm and could speak to both sides of the political spectrum. Trump cannot. Hitler also used well thought-out plans and strategies, as fucking evil as they were. Trump just likes to scream and point fingers. [end]
[start] Yeah because the United States just suffered a humiliating end to a four year conflict resulting in the loss of 7+ million young men. Thats right, depression-era Germany is so much like the United States. Putz... [end]
[start] Fuck off it's quite the other way around you democratic zombie [end]
[start] So not trying to start anything just looking for alternative opinions and view points.but what would your thoughts be if you meet someone like myself who’s parents voted democratic for the longest time because that’s what they were raised to do in the black community but, when I turned 18 I voted Trump and when they asked me why I showed a list of general policies from both parties and they twitched to vote Trump. None of us are republicans by the way we just t don’t agree with what has become of the Democratic party. [end]
[start] I think you’re right but it’s the opposite of what you mean. Hitler achieved his following by demonizing the Jews and the Germans and others (like Henry Ford) believed they were doing the right thing by getting rid of them. Much like everyone is right by getting rid of evil Trump and his demonic followers. I was horrified when Trump was elected, but when suddenly every late night talks how host roasted Trump every single night. It clicked that not was not entertainment, it was propaganda. If someone asked you every time you posted something on Reddit about disavowing the existence of the Easter bunny, then every ‘No’ answer you gave was deleted. Soon enough everyone would know that you truly believe the Easter bunny is real. Same thing with Trump and his racism. So it is easy to see how Hitler gained power and acceptance to do such horrible things. People seem pretty ok with insulting and threatening ‘Trumpers’ because they’re dumb and deserve it, just like how the Germans knew the greedy Jews deserved it back in the day. Please note Trump is a greedy business man, there’s no question but the evidence of mass mind manipulation is right there. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I'm not even American and really don't give a shit either way who wins but you sound insane man. Trump is no where even close to Hitler, considering the democrats spent 4 years trying to claim he stole an election and tried to seize power themselves with the whole bogus impeachment saga I don't see how it is so unbelievable now that the coin has flipped that Trump is calling out the democrats for messing with the election, especially when there are many undeniable examples of fraud. [end]
[start] A whole lot of us have seen this for 4 years but have been written off as alarmists... [end]
[start] trump's not even a fascist he's just a mean version of a normal republican. Maybe THAT should scare you [end]
[start] A substantial amount of Trump voters are single issue voters.  I don’t think he has the base he wants you to think he does. It’s just that an extremely vocal minority of Trump voters are like this. [end]
[start] While you americans are still focusing on Hitler,and comparing either Trump to him, or the democrats to communists,the rest of the world wonders how the fuck you got so divided between each other, it's insane. But hey,do what works for you,call Trump Hitler and Biden a commie,I bet 2024 will be more civil if you continue like that. [end]
[start] Gosh ima go post something anti trump just to get Karma as well then [end]
[start] Oh really? Well then tell us how Hitler seized power ? [end]
[start] I was thinking the same thing!!! Not going to lie, as a minority, I do net feel safe under Trump's rhetoric. I really hope things get better for this country! [end]
[start] I don’t particularly enjoy trump either but damn bro chill [end]
[start] no, no it does not explain everything. you're 30ish, I'm sure you're able to pick up a book or two [end]
[start] My worry was if trump wins America again it gives our local conservatives the impression they can get away with the same kind of shitfuckery [end]
[start] Such posts makes me understand how Americans is full of themselves and hypocrisy.  Hitler seized power in humiliated and destroyed country in economical collapse after the ww1. Not in consumeristic burger country who still one of the powerful economics in the world. [end]
[start] Then you aren't historically educated at all. I'm in disbelief so many people can upvote something so patently absurd. [end]
[start] Despite current popular thinking Trump is no where near being like Hitler.  Hitler used many different variables that was almost a decade long to slowly take power over time.  There are many historic documentaries on the Nazi rise to power.  Trump will be gone soon & American society will be able to begin repairing the effects of his presidency.  At least with a moderate in there, we will be able to have a non radicalized approach to politics. [end]
[start] You have people on both sides that blindly follow bad people. Does anyone really think Biden is not almost as bad? Look at his history. He’s basically a serial assaulter, his history on race is horrific, and he probably has dementia. If people are going to be overly critical of one, then have the morals to at least look at the actual background of the other. Unfortunately I’m probably going to get downvoted and attacked for pointing it out, but it’s just internet popularity, and some people can’t handle having their ideas challenged. [end]
[start] The Reason Hitler had Followers are pretty Simple, for example:  After the World War One Germany was destroyed and many People didn’t had a Job so everybody was poor, most of them didn’t had a Job after that   Plus Germany had Rules til then „Treaty of Versailles“ I think that and the war was the main reason why the Country was poor after that.  So Anyway ... Hitler ignore this rule and gave everybody a Job they produce guns ammo etc. after that the whole country was in love with him, they did loved him so much that he could at the beginning kill Jews without anybody notice that because no one was expecting that ...    The crazy part is the Folk loved him so much that after it was published Hitler Killing Jews everybody played blind and let him keep going with that..   I hope I could at least explain a little why Hitler had followers  and Sorry for my English ( it’s not my main language) [end]
[start] My moment of “ohhhh....” was when I was having a conversation with a person who I know is extremely well educated, rationale and intelligent, a person I respect, and he spent half an hour justifying Trump’s conduct. Like, he’d fully crossed over to the dark side and was able to make himself feel comfortable about the conduct because he genuinely believed Trump was not as bad as people said. [end]
[start] The problem with these sides is that they don't want to work together for the greater good. It's either mine or your way, depending on who wins. Therefore it's a never-ending war on who takes the lead, who gets the high table, and not a focus on who has the nation's best interest in the long run with concrete plans and proper execution. This party war reflects on the voters who end up in their own conflicting protests which turn hostile and discriminatory to the point where discourse can no longer take place. When the focus is on vilifying, criticizing, and nitpicking the other side, it hampers critical thinking, creates fear and disgust. Nothing they do will be right or commendable and even well-intentioned acts are considered fake and instantly criticized for the most minute of details. People instantly scan for points to attack and misuse without first understanding the context and the whole story. It now creates a "Cognitive block" where in a person rejects facts, logic, and reasoning just because "I am right and you are wrong" or that it conflicts with their narrative. Facts are labelled as propaganda and are rejected. The mind is closed because it is taught to hate instead of read, understand, think, and discuss. The sides now become a black and white area, and you're either all for one or none. You can't hope to comb through the pages in order to understand each one because you're either with them or against them, take everything or nothing — in short — blind acceptance to a belief without any acknowledgement that there are mistakes and room for improvement. Glorified idolatry without allowance for criticism will render anyone blind. No great leader is without flaw, unfortunately, for many reasons, people cannot see that you can look at a person for a moment without hate, nor passionate protectiveness, but can look at them objectively, see their flaws and their winning points, know what they stand for and know where they stand on important issues and reflect within yourself if you're comfortable with aligning your principles with theirs, then make the choice.

[start] Imagine if Trump was even slightly competent.  Basically, if he wasn’t a colossal fuck up, in every sense.... and didn’t fail at every attempt at literally everything... we would be in much worse shape. Our savior is his utter stupidity and inability to succeed. His long history of being gifted the world, and squandering it all.   Theres an old saying about how Hitler’s Germany got the trains to run on time.  They were an evil empire, but there was some basic competency there.  Which is what made things so much worse (because they got stuff done) [end]
[start] They are very very very different but okay [end]
[start] This is so rich. Antifa of the left are exactly like Hitler’s brown shirts. They quite literally use violence to shut down political events of the other side. They riot and destroy property. Can you all please have some self awareness. If Trump was an authoritarian you wouldn’t be able to attack him like this. [end]

Well, what came before Trump? It was Obama. Obama promised to make people's lives better, but the stock market went up while people lost money and jobs. People went for Trump because he claimed to be against the status quo (he wasn't, but he kept up the mask really well). In the 1920s Germany, money was worthless. Its material conditions that drive people, not abstract notions of democracy, and not even racism. Race is simply a useful tool to keep people divided; if one side gets convinced to kick down on the basis of race (or religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc), then others will have to call them out for racism, thus dividing the people against themselves. Hitler did the same thing, but it wasn't democracy that saved people, through prevention or the end of genocide. Its people's material conditions. Biden isn't the end. [end]
[start] Unforeseen Consequences  Wake Up and Smell The Ashes [end]
[start] Honestly same I kind of understood it before but damn bro I can’t some people don’t see the similarities. You’d think once the world makes a mistake like that it wouldn’t again not saying he’s as *bad* but he is definitely similar  his fan base is nuts to just follow him undoubtedly some of them just seem to lije him no matter what he says I thought they were trolls at first but no they’re serious it’s sad like what the fuck. It’s scary that it can happen in the modern world and so many people can just blindly follow. Even though I don’t think Trump is as bad someone else could rise to power and be as bad f not worse and lije what then? Trumps terrible not saying he isn’t btw I’m glad he’s out and by no means is he fully out I’m sure he’ll be talking on twitter or some other platform for a good while and maybe he’ll run in 2024 will he win? Hard to say this election scared me. By no means is it over watch it keep your eye on politics I know it can be exhausting but god damn. [end]
[start] Lol, we’re not a democracy. [end]
[start] My god [end]
[start] Another crybaby post [end]
[start] Correct me if I’m wrong. Please tell me you’re not seriously comparing Trump to Hitler. [end]
[start] Smh. Hitler seized power through family separation, denying education, race, and religion. Covid has done all of this and the party that is against all the things above it is a big fat contradiction. Just saying [end]
[start] As a trump supporter I can say that most don’t actually like trump including me we just know he’s the best for the country [end]
[start] It’s been 4 years and I’d like to know how Trump has brought anything close to Hitler and the genocide of Jews. In fact, if I were a Jew, I’d be fcking insanely insulted that you’re comparing their horrific experience they endured under the regime of Hitler to a sitting US President. Fcking shameful that you think your lives in the US is comparable. [end]
[start] Okay I haven't been paying attention to the news because I've been so busy. Ngl, I did vote for Trump in 16 and so did many people I know because we just really didn't like the democrat candidates. Before anyone says anything, no we don't fully support things Trump has done. If Biden wins, then he wins. What the heck is going on with people? I don't like the dems but dang am I embarrassed to have supported the Republicans if this is how they're gonna be. When are we going to get rid of the 2 party system?  ETA: I see now that Biden won. [end]
[start] Please lol.... stop normalizing nazi’s. Voting for trump and Hitler are not on the same playing field. [end]
[start] Anyone not realizing trump is basicly a fascist, not a nazi quiet yet tho, is seriously fucking delusional. You can literally find multiple clips to every single one of umberto Ecos Ur-Fascism indicators. Trumpism and QAnon is a fucking Deathcult. [end]
[start] Consequences like what?   World eats popcorn and gloats, stares how hate and rage split USA into pieces.  70 millions Trump voters called idiots, cultists and Nazis on reddit.   Crazy mobs attack lone Trump supporters after event in DC.  You wanna democracy? Be more human. Stop being mob. Be better, nicer, wiser than trumpist. Forgive and understand these 70 millions.  Or buy guns and prepare civil war. [end]
[start] Like Democrats aren’t playing the same game lmao [end]
[start] You were brainwashed. The Hitlers are in YOUR party.  Trump is not as portrayed!!!!! Now stop being so naive!!! [end]
[start] If you look back, Trump was against the stimulus check. Those people whoever they are, they tried to buy our silence. Biden just sent out a mandatory stay home order andddd the last time they ever forced anyone to stay home was when Hitler did the same thing to the Jews and lol that’s not even legal. The gov is fucking w our RIGHTS. The bill of Rights, remember that hoe? Let’s Open up our eyes...cmon. I support Trump bc at the end of it all, I don’t agree with abortion and secondly, Trump is a boss. Atleast he wasn’t on any sneaky shit trying to “buy our silence”. [end]
[start] Bidinism makes me understand how big tech and the war machine will seize power. [end]
[start] TRUMP 2020 BABY!  Get pissed off at me idgaf [end]
[start] Why do people treat me like shit just because i supported trumps policies, fuck everyone who thinks I'm racist, white supremacists just because my political views dont line with yours [end]
[start] Its crazy to see this post and how many people are in agreement. I have looked and have been able to find any facts or truth to back up these type of claims. All I see is the media expressing their opinion, which I believe is because Trump can't be bought. I do see alot of facts that Biden is part of the swamp the career politician who sells out his country and doesn't care about its people. [end]
[start] Yeah with recent posts on reddit I've been seeing I'm not sure who's side I'm on. Trump or Biden? I don't know. I live in a family of trumpers and some of the stuff I've heard my mom talk about in the phone and posts like this really have me questioning both candidates. So far I don't like either of them. Both seem just as corrupt as the other in my mind [end]
[start] Hitler? Oh hunny. Look at Obama’s little followers and you tell me who the real Hitler is. But in all seriousness, you as an American in his 30’s wouldn’t know what a real dictator was if it smack you in the face with a wrench. My boyfriends family is from Russia and his grandparents/great grandparents lived there during the Soviet Union, his father is 77 and his grandparents are long dead.... trust me, with Biden you’re going to be living not in the USA but in the USSR, commie. 👍🏻 [end]
[start] To add to that, Hitler, while campaigning for his election, wasn't advertising himself as much as a facist as Trump did. Hitler's propaganda team built an image of a passionate family man who loved children and his country. There are plenty of photos of Hitler doing not-so-facist stuffs and it wasn't until way later that German people came to really understand what they voted for. News of concentration camps started off as something mystical like the current Muslim camp issue in China but back then, verifying this kind of information was not as easy. People knew Jewish people were probably being killed but it was not the reason that other countries got involved in WWII - it was because Germany started to invade other countries. Similarly, No country is doing anything about the Muslim camp in China, either, and probably nothing will be done about it unless China pulls a Nazi Germany.   TLDR, Human sucks [end]
[start] This is just the beginning.  I read an article in The Atlantic thats pretty fresh, and definitely has me worried about a "Handmaids Tale" future. [end]
[start] Wait until these morons see that it’s actually the left pushing authoritarian control via mainstream media and social media censorship. Idk how people are so blind, it’s truly mind boggling, they are literally trying to make lists now of people who support Trump 😂 [end]
[start] Yeah, you're right, the Democrats convincing you to blindly believe everyone who doesn't see things exactly the way you do as Hitler's Brown Coats and Nazis, refusing to condemn open acts of violence against them, and refusing to fairly cover, discuss, or debate any topic, while promoting active corrupt acts and attempting to overturn a sitting President for four years is exactly how Hitler came to power.   Power through lies and hatred.  You've made any Conservative your Jew, and just like the Nazis, you believe you're following a righteous cause.   It's disgusting how dangerous the rhetoric and comments in this post are, and even moreso Reddit won't do anything about it.  You people act like you want Civil War, and believe me, you have no idea how dangerous your words are, and how little you want what you think you want. [end]
[start] The fact that you don’t realize all the hypocrisy on the left is kind of scary.  If anyone was fascist it would be modern day Democrats. [end]
[start] Fucking stop comparing him to Hitler you got no clue just how different the circumstances are and it’s sickening how you are throwing those two together. Ridiculing the sheer impact and horror of Hitler. Sincerely a German [end]
[start] First you should be aware of the echo chamber/bubble you're CURRENTLY in. Reddit is heavily liberal, so everyone here is going to echo your sentiments. I mean that's great if all you want to hear are things you already believe you're right about. I'm on reddit and even read posts such as these not to troll, but to take in the perspectives of others. As for news sources your human brain is going to naturally find offense to something you may not want to hear. I quite like OAN but can admit that it highlights more in favor of conservatives. I do get annoyed at how long they show clips of random nobody conservatives preaching from a podium in the capital - they drone on and on about nothing. However I also get annoyed listening to random nobody liberals yell how much of a racist Trump is when he's never once demonstrated actual racism (saying "there are drug cartels, rapists, and murderers coming across the border" in a 2016 debate is not racist. He did NOT say "all of these people coming over are criminals, rapists..." etc.) He was highlighting how it's a problem not having strict standards on admissions at the border, or not having admissions at all and turning a blind eye. Not everyone coming is just wanting a better life, and you can't sus out the traffickers if anyone can just hop on over unabated.  I have to do a dance between CBS, OAN, CNN, & Newsmax to get somewhat an accurate picture of what's true. Watching the standard networks refuse to give any acknowledgement of Dominion voting systems having serious flaws is mind blowing. Watching Twitter decide what you can and cannot post is also crazy. Even if articles are not true, people have always been allowed the freedom to use their brain and decide for themselves. I mean I think I was 10 when I was gawking at a tabloid magazine in the grocery isle that claimed the government was concealing aliens they found, and decided it was bullshit. I didn't need the grocer to refuse to carry the tabloid to "protect" me.   Anyway, I'm glad there are people on both "sides" trying to keep things moving in a positive direction. I'm no right wing crazy. I would love to make sure (verify, through making it open source) voting is truly real and not something EITHER side can just change on a whim. I would love healthcare for all. I would love college tuition for all. I would love INCREASED immigration. But I would love if the government was required to do everything by running IN THE BLACK. I can't go shopping and get everything my heart desires without checking my bank account. I can't decide not to pay my taxes. The government expects me to be responsible and run a balanced household. Why shouldn't they be expected to do the same thing? It's almost as if many people never grew up learning it may be hard but you're going to have to say "no" to A LOT of things that you just can't afford. Illegal immigration actually hurts the ability to increase legal immigration. Like it or not when we have people coming to the US they are going to need services (medical, educational, housing, food, utilities, childcare, etc.). If we don't have our budget in order we're going to easily overspend public funds. To keep funding in check you're going to have to turn many millions away. Without doing that you're actually making it HARDER on those that have already come to survive. Want to know why your healthcare is so high? Because when someone with no ID goes to the hospital ER for services they can't be turned away (a good thing actually), but when they can't pay, the hospital gets public funds to cover so much of this... but but much. So where do the healthcare conglomerates feel they can make up the difference? In the services and plans they offer the rest of us. Again, it'd be great if NONE of us had to pay for healthcare, I'm on board with that! But with millions and millions and millions of undocumented/illegal immigrants coming to the US without authorization there's absolutely zero chance that will ever happen. The dollars don't add up. [end]
[start] Well this time we got the fascists before the hyperinflation so thats progress I guess? [end]
[start] Im originally from Germany and I could never understand the mentality of the people who voted Hitler into power back then. Now I do. It’s been on my mind a lot. [end]
[start] Now that Trump had been removed from power, we can finally concentrate and the major issues facing the world. Climate change, Radical Islam and Poverty [end]
[start] Agreed! [end]
[start] I’m confused but isn’t it the democratic liberals in New York chasing down, threatening, fining Jews and their business? I mean that’s what started happening during the Holocaust, right before hitler rounded them up gave them numbers and killed them. And which party has been burning and looting. Maybe just maybe trump took power because people don’t want another holocaust. The poorest most dangerous cities in the US are dem run cities. If dems are so great what have they done to prove that in the last 80 years?   Edit: No I didn’t vote trump [end]
[start] You know it’s BLM and Antifa burning down everything and literally burning the American flag. Antifa marched in Denver that had a sign saying “Death to Facists and Liberalism” but oookkkaaayyyyy.... [end]
[start] DEMOCRACY CAN'T STOP IT!!! Sorry for the caps, but it's USING (sorry) democracy to propagate. True, Biden one, but meanwhile they're working on some new Right wing news network. They work democracy, they work truth, they work facts or what philosophers call "facticity" itself to get into power. You have to dig deeper and work harder to get at the core aspects of this horrible development. All these media personalities saying "Vote!" leading up to the elections were all saying the same thing: "Democracy will solve it", and while there was some success, there was no landslide in the Senate and the House lost seats. The issue here is something that democracy can't solve, although it must play a role.  Do you want your doctor to be "elected" into "office" by  your neighbors? Or do you want them to be vetted through an actual process of education and accreditation? Well I got news for you, the latter is not democratic. [end]
[start] I wish I understood.  I'm watching it happen around me and I don't understand. [end]
[start] It's called baseless populism and it has been tricking the masses for centuries. [end]
[start] It's even worst. As bad as Hitler was, Germany survived Hitler, but Trump could have been the ending of American democracy, just like how Caesar ended Rome's democracy. Once you lose democracy, it's far harder to gain it back. Rome didn't. Legal Eagle did a great episode on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d22Y7p3tER0 [end]
[start] Get a grip 😂 [end]
[start] Troll. [end]
[start] It’s funny. Both sides are basically cult like. Die hard Trump supporters are way too far gone, and probably ARE racist old shits. A lot of them are probably white supremacists and homophobic/transphobic/other phobics. They don’t listen to science, and are in their own little fictitious world of alternative news.     But die hard Liberals are just as bad. They preach tolerance, yet if you have even SOME conservative beliefs (like lower taxes) apparently you support Trump. If you approve some of what Trump has done (like what he’s done with the economy. Or lowest black and hispanic unemployment in the history of America) you’re apparently a Trump supporter and evil. They are also in an echo chamber, and just LOVE to get the mora high ground by trying to put hateful words in your mouth.   America is way too fucking divided. Politics has basically become a war of cults. Honestly, most of ya don’t even know who or what you’re voting for tbh. People just listen to what social media says a candidates positions are and take that for granted. Ya don’t even do your own research. Makes me sick tbh. It’s why I didn’t vote for ANY candidate. Literally none of them had shit I fully agreed with. And I’m not voting for anyone that I don’t think is fit to be president.   Downvote needs if you want, it won’t make it any less true. [end]

[TITLE] Question, audiobook vs Ebook vs physical book? [TITLE]
[start] I'm sure that you can find some compromise.  I buy used books online (typically under $10 ea).  New ones if I really feel the need.    I only keep the ones that I think I will read again.  The rest I either give to friends or drop off at a local 'lending library' give-a-book/take-a-book thing. [end]
[start] Because physical books are dying out, sad to say. My preference is my iPad for books. Easy to take all of them with me, and I can download audio books and podcasts as well. The Kindle app works very well on it.   I do have two boxes of books I've kept, some are favorites and some are related to my profession. Other than that, I donated most of them because of the space issue. Also, I hate the idea of killing trees.   If you're military, go with an e-reader. And thank you for your service! [end]

[start] Hey man, I'm in a similar spot rn. It's a shitty health situation that's getting turbo-charged by Winter months, not a lot of sleep this night and the overall COVID situation. All I want is to be done with the health situation (already had 3 surgeries this year, probably making it a dozen over the last 14 years - 22yo atm). A good friend of mine has the same thing, is 1 year younger than me and had already successfully finished treatment 2 years ago ==> anger, frustration, envy, but also a slight loss of empathy or just not feeling happy for those who have it better than me. I think that last one is more common than we might think.  I wouldn't categorize you as an incel, it sounds like you're a nice 'niceguy' with some shitty life experiences at worst, unless you left out the part about writing horrible messages to girls who rejected you. Therapy or a heart-to-heart with friends is probably the best way to go about it.  I just want you to know that someone read your post. I can sympathize in *some* ways.  &#x200B;  Edit: Keep in mind that achknowledgement/being aware of the problem is the first step to treating it. You know what is right and what is wrong, as long as you do what's right or at least don't do what's wrong you're golden. This is a cunt of a year, it accelerates already shitty things, hold through till the next COVID-free summer and decide then if life's still as shitty as you thought and wrote today. [end]

[TITLE] what does it mean when you can’t start something (like a show that’s like an hour an ep) bc u don’t wanna waste time, but then go and spend absurd amounts of time watching short clips, especially ones that you’ve already watched Numerous times? [TITLE]
[start] Everyone here is saying short attention span, which I dont think is the issue; from what I can tell, you dont want to commit to watching  something long because if you domt enjoy it you'll consider it a waste of time, while if you watch a bunch of short videos, if you're not entertained it's done before you even notice. I get this too, whenever I want to watch a  new show I just end up rewatching the same stuff because it's reliable, it gives my brain the happy chemicals I'm used to.   If you're having difficulty sleeping, it's probably because you're using your phone before bed; turn on a blue light filter if possible, your phone screen is bright enough normally that it convinces you it's still daytime and therefore still time to stay awake. [end]
[start] That you have a very short attention span. [end]

[TITLE] Why is coming out important? [TITLE]
[start] there isnt a greater meaning. people who care about coming out just feel differently than you. for lots of us, it feels affirming and good to tell people, makes it feel more real. society has put a lot of effort into making sure everyone is assumed cishet and raised that way, and coming out is a way of owning our sexuality or gender, taking it back from the people who said we couldnt have it. some people also see nit coming out as living a lie, like. people will assume, because im a girl, that i like boys, or that, because im a trans girl, that i *am* boys. and if i dont say something, it'd mean having to play along, essentially, be someone i'm not. or i could say something, come out, and let them see the real me.  but if you dont want to come out, or dont feel you need it, good on you! you do your own thing, and you're right, your sexuality or who you're attracted to is yours, and its your right to choose to keep it to yourself, and no one else has a right to know that. in the end, you can choose whether coming out is important for you, and only you can choose. and if anyone doesnt like your choice, fuck 'em.

[start] Damn dude. That was hard to read. I was cut as an infant and left with basically no frenulum (and I honestly have no idea if that's worse than experiencing what it's supposed to feel like and *then* losing it..)  I felt betrayed when I learned what had been done to me, and was furious with my parents for a long, long time for allowing it. In my early 20's I took restoration seriously using [the DTR](http://www.foreskinrestore.com/main.html), wearing it for entire shifts every day at most. While I didn't stick with it long enough to reach my goal of overhang while hard, I now have more than enough to glide, and stay covered while soft when I'm wearing tight underwear. Now I just manually stretch for fun now and then and to get myself going.  I can't honestly say if it's comparable to being uncut, but to me it was a huge improvement. I used to need lube to masturbate and have torn skin often. Now I glide easily, have a sensitive glans again, and the skin is damn near impervious due to the stress of tension. It can and will get better if you dedicate the time to restoring. Good luck, brother.  **Also to anyone reading, don't cut your goddamn kids. Not boys, not girls, not anything in between. Not for religious reasons, not to make them look like daddy, not to deny the reality that you were the victim of sexual assault. Just don't fucking do it.** [end]

Family have reached out telling me how hurt my father is, he’s struggling to have a relationship but it has been so toxic for so long that I just can’t. He was always very cheap but in the last few years he spent a lot of money on the house for guests that he never haves and in trips with family members because he has no one else.   My mom dropped the bomb that she has thought about leaving him which makes me worry about her financial situation too. He’s setting himself up to end up alone and bitter and I don’t know what to do to prevent it. I wish he could see it and tried to fix his problems, if not for him for the ones he hurts. He also seems to remember things in a very peculiar way where he never did anything wrong. As a man I see a lot of him in me and that just scares me, and as someone concerned about mental health I worry about carrying my problems with him to future relationships.   I hope you can find peace with the situation, my best wishes. [end]
[TITLE] Online school sucks [TITLE]
[TITLE] Another puppy... [TITLE]
[start] not if you train it to hate [end]
[TITLE] Just wanted to share this: I hate it when these self-proclaimed "self-help gurus" come of nowhere with no kids, never married, and probably from a trust fund to try to tell people working ordinary jobs, with children and in a f****d up relationship how to live your best life..... [TITLE]
[start] You tell in on the mountain!  "Feeling depressed? Just go to Tahiti for two weeks and envision your happiness!"  "Oh, your two year old has type I diabetes, and you have no insurance? You should feed them this Kale and Expensiveberry diet, and meditate on how your child's physical illness doesn't have to be your mental illness!"  Grah. [end]
[start] your name is unlimited advice, it just means you are known for having....  a stubborn opinion [end]
[start] Yup. Same with lots of YouTubers who give advice, like study channels. It's great that they have such good, comparatively easy lives. It sucks that their advice often assumes that you do too. [end]
[start] Probably lol I’m sure some of them had to struggle, or something happened where they feel the need to make others feel better. But yeah the whole format of self help is kind of flaccid in of itself. You don’t need help helping yourself... you just do it. [end]
[start] I won’t tell you « you chose to have kids » cause I don’t know, and it was maybe a good idea.  But you chose to marry, You chose your job and probably your studies too? You chose to stay in a fucked up relationship (yes, even if you’re abused, we’re not only victims we’re also full grown people).   I don’t particularly appreciate those « gurus » but I really dislike people who regard life like everything is happening to them without them being responsible for anything. [end]
[start] I started watching a youtube video about how to start a business as a virtual assistant, and within the first 2 minutes she was talking about her daily coffee enemas and I noped out. No way do I need to take advice from someone like that. haha. [end]
[start] I don't know what self-help gurus you're talking about, but in my experience, everyone is out here handing out advice for situations they have no first-hand experience with. [end]
[TITLE] 11:36 AM (Random Thoughts) 11/16/20 [TITLE]
[TITLE] My ex took the PS4 Pro and it bothers me more than it probably should. [TITLE]
[start] A lot of people are in your shoes. Those success stories you hear about being able to afford everything after 30 are few and far between. It's not bullshit but it's bullshit. I'd even bet 100,000 out of million only ever get to that point of prosperity. There's debt, union fees, taxes, loans, blah, blah, and blah. A to Z expenses no one ever considers. My father makes $29 an hour on a 40 hour work week. Sounds like a shit ton right? Sounds like he can afford anything he wants, right? Wrong. He pays 50% of that into pension, union fees, and taxes. The remaining $14.50 gets spent on rent, loan payments, and utilities. Leaving him a measly $100 a week for food and $20 for lunch.  It makes my blood boil when people call someone lazy or uneducated because they can't afford anything. It's never that simple. [end]
[start] Sorry bro. So wait though you are still living together?  And what she moved the PS4 pro to her own bedroom or something?  I don’t really follow. Are you guys on bad terms or something now?  She won’t let you use it? [end]
[TITLE] My dad is kicking me out because I VISITED MY AUNT but maybe its for the best [TITLE]

[TITLE] Is it normal to stop being excited for your birthday anymore? [TITLE]
[start] I'm turning 30 soon. Nah, I haven't really cared about birthdays since I guess 21. [end]
[start] Totally normal. I stopped being excited right around the time I was 18 or 19. That was in the early 1920s. I'm an old fucker. [end]
[TITLE] Hi everyone. Victoria here. [TITLE]
[start] Victoria, I always enjoyed talking to you and working with you and am sad we no longer work together.  Perhaps some day we can work together, but in the mean time I hope someone great picks you up ... I've been contacted by a handful of people who'd like to hire you :)  Thank you for helping redditgifts over the years, before we both worked for reddit.  I'll never forget your help and friendship. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] There will always be a place for you at the /u/Warlizard Gaming Forums.  [end]
[start] Your contributions will be missed here but truth be told I'm hugely excited for you.  I mean, your skill, talent, and general awesomeness were just the subject of an op-ed in the NYT.  When I think of your resume this is all I can think of:  http://i.imgur.com/JvxCQSP.jpg  I hope you'll make the most of it (and know you will)!  All the best!!! [end]
[start] /u/chooter right now  http://i.imgur.com/eumv53g.gif [end]
[start] And so it begins: the Post-Victorian era. [end]
[start] Victoria, you're the best. We met virtually when we tried to arrange a Vanilla Ice AMA, and then in person when we did the reddit telethon. To me, you've always been a stone cold professional who impressed me with your kindness, speed at which you typed and knowledge of RuPaul's DragRace.   Your future is undefined, but I have every confidence that you'll lay the bricks towards something remarkable. You're the best!  [end]
[start] Hey /u/chooter, just throwing an idea out there: You should start your own website that specializes in celebrity Q&As with users. I mean you clearly have the skills for it, and I imagine during your time at reddit that you made some good contacts.  [end]
[start] Need any references? I think we can drum up a few thousand people to speak for you. [end]
[start] Victoria, it has been a true pleasure working alongside you in IAMA, and I think I speak for all of us when I say you really have made a difference. You've touched the lives of millions of people, and made them happier.  I know you will only go on to greater things. But please stick around on reddit too and keep being awesome here. [end]
[start] Good luck, we're all counting on you.  [end]
[start] Thank you for all your help! :)  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Your next employers will be extraordinarily lucky to have your talent on their team. [end]
[start] It's amazing how classy you have been through all this. Best of luck for whatever's next! [end]
[start] Dear /u/chooter,   I'm just a casual redditor. I comment where and as I feel like it, but I don't contribute content really or mod any subreddits. Just the same, I hope you realize that even us filthy casuals really appreciated what you did for the website we love. The AMAs you helped with were among the best, and were a big part of the reason I enjoy this place.   Yours are big shoes to fill, and you should feel really great about what you did 'round these parts. So thanks.  Good luck with all you do in the future.  Sincerely,   /u/nerfcaltrops   [end]
[start] Victoria, one thing about you that stood out was the way in which those people who were the subjects of the AMAs thanked you and gave you kudos for making their participation easy and enjoyable.  Thank you for all your hard work. [end]
[start] Hey Chooter..I'm the one who requested the Marta Kaufman AMA several months back..we played pm tag for a while? Anyway, this whole thing kinda blows me away. I've been on Reddit for a couple years but I've never taken an interest in the politics that boil around here, much less the roster of who the Reddit-employed users are*. When I saw that you were the center of this drama I was in shock. I don't know why this happened to you(if that info is even out) or if the circumstances were civil and you deserved it(lol), but I'm sorry. I appreciate that you took the time to even respond to me(so many times), even if things didn't work out. I hope your next internet home is kinder.  *Seriously, I thought this Ellen Pao everyone was talking about was an actress or something. [end]
[start] You can put our names up on your resume as references. We'll rave about you.  And don't worry, we won't mention that time you took some office supplies home /s. [end]
[start] I liked how people filled Reddit with headlines containing your name. Thanks for everything! [end]
[start] You seem like a nice person and I've found that when nice people are no longer in a company, the company generally doesn't have long. So while this place is still around, thank you for your service and help and I genuinely wish you the best in whatever you choose to do. Take care, Victoria. :) [end]
[start] From all of Reddit: Much love Victoria! [end]
[start] It's been a real pleasure getting to know you and I, for one, have learned an awful lot from you.    I think it was apparent from the outpouring of support that you are well liked and your work was well appreciated here by the community.    Keep being awesome.  :) [end]
[start] Thanks for really stepping up the quality of AMAs, since not everything needs to be about rampart. [end]
[start] Thank you Victoria.   We didn't get to interact much here on reddit, but you were always super awesome.  If you have some free time, we could always use a hand in moderating /r/foxes :) [end]
[start] Thanks for all the great work when we were e-mailing during AMA stuff, you were always a fun class act, and thanks again for the book and fun stuff you mailed, too! :D  If you feel like it, PM me your address, would love to return the courtesy! [end]
[start] You're a special kind of person. Thank you for everything you've done for the community.  You deserve a great deal and I think you'll get just that.  [end]
[start] Good luck, Victoria! IAMAs won't be the same without you and typing in all the person's beats, stutters, inside jokes, etc.. It was almost as if we could "hear" the person next to you right in front of us. [end]
[start] I told the missus Friday that Reddit fucked up and sacked the girl from the AMAs. "They fired Victoria? Stupid bastards" she said.  When the woman who can't even turn on the TV and satellite box knows who Victoria is, you know that Victoria's somebody special.   Best of luck Chooter, keep us updated.  [end]
[start] It was an honor and a privilege getting to know you over at iama, Vic. You're one in a million <3 Keep smiling. [end]
[start] I'm gonna miss the Victorian era but best of luck to whatever comes next for you! [end]
[start] You don't know what you have until it's gone ....  I never really reflected on how you shaped the AMAs until I started to remember all the details you added to each answer. Made them much more enjoyable and personal.  Almost as being in the room.  Good luck in your endeavors!  I hope you will be able to bring unique and exciting experience wherever you go.    [end]
[start] Hey, nice to see you here, it must be very interesting to be at the center of this mess, or at least in close proximity to it.  I hope you're well, and that things are good.   Write a book! [end]
[start] Good luck Victoria, thanks for your hard work and dedication. And thanks for taking that outpouring of love (that got at times borderline creepy) in the best way possible. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Wherever you go, I wish you well. Thank you for everything :) [end]
[start] Thank **you** and I wish you all the best. [end]
[start] Your eloquence is only exceeded by your humility.  Thank you for all the answers!   [end]
[start] Love from all of us at /r/books <3 [end]
[start] You're the best [end]
[start] Victoria, you are awesome, and I suspect you'll end up with a much better job after this ridiculousness.  Reddit was extremely unprofessional in the way they handled the whole situation.  I own my own business, and I would be out of business pretty damn quick if I treated employees like that.  Reddit does not seem to understand this, and they are ruining their brand.  It's difficult to have to fire someone, but Reddit should have had the courtesy to treat you like the valuable member of their team, which you were.  Unfortunately, many redditors will never forget nor forgive the injustice of your case.  It's said that everything happens for a reason so I predict much bigger and better things for you.  YOU ARE AWESOME! [end]
[start] I look forward to seeing which company recruits your amazing talent next...  Thank you for all the time and effort you have put in here, and good luck in your future endeavors! =) [end]
[start] Best wishes to you in the future from the larger lurking club members. We'll miss you. [end]
[start] [You're awesome.](http://i.imgur.com/N0thsPy.jpg)  That is all. [end]

[start] I'm not ready for the post Victoria era of reddit. Best of luck in all your future endeavorers Victoria!!  [end]
[start] Good luck, ma'am.  Don't want to ask any more of you than you've already been kind enough to provide, but let us know how things go if you get the chance.  Thanks. [end]
[start] I never got to know you but I like many others knew of you. You exemplify everything that we hoped for in an employee of a site we love and we hope you are soon rewarded for that passion you bring to the work you do! [end]
[start] I'm so drunk so you up for sex?  [end]
[start] you are a class act, V.  [end]
[start] I'm so glad that you still post here. So glad you didn't abandon our community after being let go. Props to you /u/chooter  [end]
[start] Loved working with you on all those fun AMAs... we'll have to grab some drinks and just celebrate the humor of life in general <3  [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Hi /u/chooter , thank you so much for everything that you've done for reddit! It was a pleasure interacting with all the IAMAs that you hosted. If you ever need a new home let us know over at http://www.pushdup.com and we can talk :) [end]
[start] Good luck Victoria, keep on being awesome! [end]
[start] I hope you find the peace and enjoyment you obviously had here in your future endeavors. Best of luck! [end]
[start] Best of luck in all future endeavors Victoria. Thank you for everything that you have done to make Reddit the great community that it is today. You won't be forgotten. [end]
[start] Did you expect such a deep and possibly weird reaction from reddits community?  [end]
[start] I hope you'll stick around! [end]
[start] Best of luck with your future endeavours!  [end]
[start] Good luck on your adventures Chooter, hopefully we see you around some more.  [end]

[start] Thanks for everything /u/chooter! Good luck out there. I like to think you'll still be lurking.  [end]
[start] Your essence will be dearly missed here. I think I speak for all of us when I say that you were an integral part of the community. Wish you the best in your future endeavors! I am forever in debt to you for all the hours of entertainment you brought me. Anyways, hope to see your username around. See you later u/chooter! [end]
[start] Wow. Nice message.  [end]
[start] How about some type of radio show/ podcast/ or late night show? You're obviously excellent at giving interviews. No matter who it is.  I think we can all agree on that.  [end]
[start] <3 You were the best.  Stay awesome! Good luck! [end]
[start] I'll never forget how you captured the very essence of chef Ramsay for his ama, you're an amazing person, everyone here is proof of that, I'm sure you'll move on to better things in your future, maybe not in so much spotlight, and maybe not this well respected, but you'll always hold the spotlight and respect here, I hope you hang around and continue to enjoy the community you've become such a pillar in, thank you for all the time you put in here, truly. [end]
[start] Thanks /u/chooter reading your AMA's as a lurker is what first got me interested in reddit! You are a legend!  [end]
[start] You will be missed!  Good luck in whatever you do and where ever you end up. [end]
[start] Why no one ask the important question, why she got fired?  [end]
[start] Reddit gold x13. Everyone just paid reddit as a thank you for Victoria getting fired.  Oh the irony. [end]
[start] I haven't really been on reddit for that long, but I am choked up by your candor and goodwill. Keep being awesome. The world needs people like you.  [end]
[start] I really liked your transcript of Tommy Wiseau. You wrote it exactly like him, it was hilarious. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] That sounds more like a person who understands the community. More so than the "apology" you will be missed. [end]
[start] Our voices matter?  Absolutely nothing happened. [end]
[start] Perhaps reddit could hire OP for advice on how to communicate sincerely.  [end]
[TITLE] My son is a hateful incel, and I just cannot save him or defend him anymore. [TITLE]
[start] this is some top tier bait... [end]
[start] crock of shit [end]
[start] My younger brother was a lot like this and eventually got thrown out as well. None of the perverse gross shit thankfully but still was largely violent, rude, stole a lot, vandalized, and other garbage. My dad and I did everything we could, both positive and negative from talks and being more inclusive to stripping him of his stuff and sending him to both help and a camp. Nothing cracks a kid like this. There eventually was a point where he attacked my disabled dad and I stepped in and the police had to be called to get him to stop. He was pretty much detached and abandoned at that point.  Luckily once he got out on his own he really flipped a 180 over a few years. Realized he needed to work, realized he couldn't treat the world the way he wanted, and realized his mistakes growing up. He's working a full time job in a factory and saving for a house for his soon to be wife and firstborn kid. He comes by each weekend or so to hang out with my dad and bond. He still can be narrow visioned on his ideals and verbally not the most appropriate at times but hes really a changed man and awesome to have my brother back. We got lucky, and theres days I regret not doing even more to help him get here sooner. But we're good now and the past is behind us all. Hes been great like this for 3 years now or so; Im 28 and him 24.  Just want to let you know that theres hope I guess. Your son may very well feel like the worst thing to exist, but here's to hoping he finds out how to course correct. That old saying of you can bring a horse to water but can't make it drink and all. Just make sure when he comes crawling back you remain open minded ok? It takes a lot of effort to have the gall to come back from that, so if he shows up, he's genuinely hurting and looking to mend. [end]
[start] Half the comments are calling BS and the other half are describing people IRL they know like this.  [end]
[start] Real or fake this story definitely makes me want to get my shit together just in general. [end]
[start] Please be fake please be fake [end]
[start] Holy shit R.L Stein, save it for publishing.  [end]
[start] Your title is a bit misleading. I’d say hateful incel is a vast understatement.   If this story is true, that kid is going to be considered a criminal by the state real soon.  [end]
[start] Pretty sure some people in this thread would think this was real even if he ended up in bel air and the cab had dice in the mirror. [end]
[start] This reads very much like a weird fantasy story where OP self-inserts themselves as the ‘pristine daughter’. While incels may actually be like what’s described in this post, the story plays out too much like a weird self-insert story that plays out like a 90s sitcom. [end]
[start] This better be a fake story for internet points I don't want to believe this is real.  [end]
[start] My son is almost like this and it scares me. Everyone wants to blame it on the parents. You try to little then you're a shit parent for not trying hard enough. You push to hard then your abusive and toxic. There is no fucking middle grougy when it comes to parenting any more. I'm not going to lie, I didn't read all the post due to how long it was but from what I did read described my son almost too well.   We get into a lot of fights around here from his behavior.  He gets rude, hateful, unappreciative from the sacrifices his mom and I make for him, he gets bossy, he has the attitude that my wife is his and his sister is his. We told him the other night that we had enough of his disrespectful attitude and he was going to therapy. Weirdly enough he texted his mom today and asked when he started and wanted to talk to the therapist alone. We are very alarmed right now because we don't know if something happened to him that he's not telling us.   [end]
[start] God you people are so fucking gullible.   This is literally 4chan satire. They post stories like this all the time on here because they know that so many will take the bait. They're literally laughing at you right now over there.   THIS IS FAKE. YOU HAVE BEEN TROLLED. [end]
[start] You better be trolling.  No seriously. I hope you just wrote everything wrong with ALL of the incels into one nasty character.  Becouse if not that would mean your son is 4chan INCARNATE. Which sounds like an absolute nightmare. I don't wish that on anyone.     [end]
[start] people say this is fake but the beginning up until he begins straight up harassing girls irl is EXACTLY how my younger brother is.   hes 16, about to turn 17 this month. he doesnt shower, shave, cut his hair, refuses to use deoderant or brush his teeth. since he was maybe 6 he played video games a lot and would piss in drawers or in the closet just so he wouldnt have to leave the game. he once shit behind the couch so he could keep playing on the console and blamed it on the dog. the couch was pretty much against the wall and our dog was medium-large and fat. he continued this until he was 15. i have PTSD about it and when i hear running water that sounds like peeing i cry and have an anxiety attack. he stays inside stinking up the house and playing games and has been INCREDIBLY abusive to my mother since he was maybe 12. my mom tries to give him love all the time. once when she tried to hug him he punched her and knocked a front tooth loose, its still loose but thank god it didnt come out. i think she gave up recently. she still worries about him but hes so hateful. shes realized she cant do anything anymore. i love my mom and hate him so much and cant wait to go nocontact with him if possible. idk why i just wordvomited all of this, i guess cos this post so closely related to this trauma. thank you for not enabling your 'son'. [end]
[start] This was quite the read. Your son's audacity is truly something else. I'm astounded you put up with his bullshit as long as you did.  You shouldn't blame yourself for your son's choices. You did everything you could for him. You tried to relate to him, to get him help. It was his choice to isolate himself. He never met you halfway.  It sounds like your daughter turned out well. Keep being there for her, her boyfriend, and your wife. You've all earned a respite from your son's dangerous behavior. [end]
[start] ...is this real? it cant be! this kid literally meets every single stereotype/meme/joke of every hardcore incel/trump fan/anime loli/pedophile I've ever heard or seen written. it's way too extreme to actually be true!    ...but if it is. god help you, god help your family and god help your community, because that kid will be a rapist if he isnt one already. he also shows every sign in the textbook of becoming a mass shooter. IF THIS IS REAL, please man, you need to do something about your son. [end]
[start] Had a different but similar experience. Put his gaming stuff in the basement and locked it. Came into the hallway and he had running chain saw and had cut the door open.  It got worse. Much much worse. Fast forward a bit, he’s at a therapeutic boarding school, very supportive and troubled kids. The phrase they use is “your son needs a higher level of care”. So, we go with one of those boot camps and before getting him there, had met with director explained this kid is not like the others you’ve had. Director talks about their education levels, years in operation and level of outdoor skills. The 3rd day there, director calls and says they had to put a dedicated team of 5 guys on him. Day 5 comes the phrase “your son needs a higher level of care”. These places you to wait for an open bed. 3 weeks back in out home - never explained the fast forward parts but terror was a component. 5am, transport arrives - two guys 6’5” and 6’8” take him more than a thousand miles to a hospital, very special facility. First time in their history, there is an escape, 3 of them. Guess who led it? Fast forward some more, months later discharged. All private pay more the $500 per day. More than a median house where we live - his college education and then some. More residential programs. Today, he’s better, still struggling at times but hold a job briefly. Has had more than 50 of them, mostly fired some quit but recently promoted and given raises.  My wife and I, we couldn’t do it. It was one guy at the hospital who for months of intense work broke through and started the healthy trend.  Your son is older and you’re no longer guardian. Seems there’s enough there for involuntary hospitalization but likely a private pay. It takes enormous time and effort to navigate the system. If the mental health route isn’t taken, prison is coming which is an amplifier for what is worse. A glimpse into the fast forward part - convinced the local Sheriff to do a scarred straight session and explaining on the way there what’s going to happen, my son is getting somber at the prospect of what’s going to happen and we arrive and he bursts out laughing that he’s already stayed overnight there.  If you’re done, you’re done and at some point you have to pull out. The fact you wrote makes me think you still might have hope.  There are no guarantees and can tell it will be years of work, more than $100k, likely much more. Truly years of some the hardest work you will do against a system that isn’t very good at responding to these kind of care needs.  Just know if you are able to take on such a challenge with the potential for failure there’s hope and know it could all go south. We have two kids the other is doing great but has some resentment on the effort put to the other. Turns out that’s not unusual happens with cancer and other diseases as well where unbalanced effort creates a feeling of neglected.  Feel for you, been there and done that [end]
[start] My comment will get buried at the bottom, but maybe you'll see it. I'm going to get downvoted for my advice, but it's just advice based off my experience. Before saying this, I'll preface it with saying at the time I did have mental health issues (bipolar/ severe manic depression) that I have since then worked through. The best thing my parents ever did for me was kick me out of their house right before I was suppose to graduate from high school, so I think you have a good start. It was slightly different circumstances, where I was kicked out because I was stealing and using drugs, but the way my family felt sounds like the same as yours does I'm sure. I had no sense of responsibility and an extreme lack of respect. I spent a large portion of 2013 and 2014 homeless in Baltimore city (and also a large Amount of 2010-2015 in an out of rehab). In hindsight, my parents allowing me to live there just nurtured my behavior and fueled it. It is, in my opinion, the most valid option. I was at a point where I was severely effecting my parents marriage because they couldn't agree on what to do with me. This trickled down to also effecting my siblings, and family life for everyone. My parents sat me down and said they loved me but they were out of options. The years that followed were rough, but I woke up. I'm four years sober now, off all medication, in college, and back at home (funny how that works). I have an awesome relationship with my family and I'm an asset rather than a burden. This never would have happened if they would have continuously let me live the way I was, just sending me to therapists that I would give lip service to, and allowing me to be disrespectful. My parents said it's the hardest decision they've ever made, but that's risk reward. I see so many other people that are in the same situation I was in back in 2012, but the families nurture their behavior (not their fault, these situations are extremely tough) and it grows to a point where it's out of control. My parents, my family, and my friends still say they can't believe who I am today because they had lost hope long before I decided to get it together. I wouldn't have got it together living there being enabled to act that way. Once again, I understand it's not the same circumstances, but the behaviors and the solution are the same, imo.    Edit:  I guess I wasn't smart enough to figure out it was fake. That makes me sad I just put effort into this while Typing it on my phone because I feel strongly about it.  [end]

[start] This is funny. I was complaining about the writing prompts sub the other day and how they lack a key skill in writing, subtlety   My go to when determining real or fake is the detail or lack thereof, it’s pretty easy to test yourself   First you write a true story about yourself, nothing more than that. Just a true story about you.   And then you make up a (believable) story about yourself that you want others to think is true   The made up one will be significantly longer and more detailed because you’re trying to push something you know isn’t true. You won’t add all this to the true story because it already sells itself to you. I don’t know why anyone would lie about this but here’s an example. First one is someone who went to the park. Second one is someone who wants you to think they went to the park   The Truth: I went to the park today   The Lie: I went to the park. I was sitting on a bench feeding the ducks and this lovely old lady sat next to me and we had a great conversation   First one has no need to add any detail, they went to the park. They know they went to the park.   Second one feels the need to reinforce that they went to the park by giving all these details that were never asked for   There’s no subtlety in this post, it’s black and white. Good vs Bad. Bisexual sister and plucky black boyfriend vs Cum stain panty sniffing incel trump supporter brother   Congrats on the upvotes, you earned it   Also if someone does manage to read this in the 1000’s of comments let me know what you think, agree or disagree.

[start] > He’s appreciative of things - in the winter, it was -20 and he had only a hoodie, so I draped my jacket over his arms, and I said “take it son, it’s cold.” He had tears in his eyes as he said thank you, and I made some excuse about wanting to get rid of the jacket and told him he could keep it if he brought cookies for us next time he visited.   This is the best thing I have ever read. Straight out of a Lifetime movie.   That right there pushed me over the fence into bullshit territory.   You overdid it.  [end]
[start] Can you prove any of this?  The internet has jaded me. I just don’t believe this anecdotal story [end]
[start] While these things do happen and people like his son do exist, my gut tells me this is fake. The story reads like a movie and hits too many of the tropes.  [end]
[start] This is the most perfect fictional story ever posted to this website.  Bravo OP.  I hope your creative writing prof gives you an A+. [end]
[start] Not sure why at the end he put Jordan Peterson is a negative light when Peterson rails against incels and calls them douchebags in the most eloquent of tones.  Peterson is anti incel like Mr Clean is anti dirt.  [end]

[start] This is /r/4chan to a tee. Either your kid is the living embodiment of an entire site, or I'm not buying it. Too many fake stories recently. Just waiting for the inevitable update in a few days to confirm it [end]
[start] Hopefully people can realize this is fake. If there were a contest to make the most fucked story of an "incel" terrorizing your life, this would have to be the winner. I don't think I could edit OP's post to make the son sound like a worse person. Sure you could throw in some rape or murder, but in my opinion, the son is already a 10/10 sociopath and 10/10 terrible and mentally fucked person. No space to get worse.  [end]
[start] Haha! What a story Mark. [end]
[start] Way too many cliches this is hilarious  [end]

[start] This feels like a larp. And I hope it is. It's too textbook. [end]
[start] Okay who the fuck gilded this. Five people! How gullible can you be? [end]
[start] Even Lifetime would turn down this fictional nonsense for being too far fetched. It absolutely defies believability with every cliche, convenience and load of extraneous detail. What was the point? Did someone bet OP that Reddit couldn't be *that* gullible? [end]

I guess OP was right, he was going to receive lots of attention for it, specially now that incels became such a hot topic. But anyone with a brain can see this history was carefully cooked to  hit every fragile emotional point of the average Reddit user. Fake. As hell. [end]

[start] This story is too perfectly written and constructed to be a Reddit masterpiece, bullshit   It hits literally every Reddit bingo topic you could think of  [end]
[start] r/thathappened  [end]
[start] Holy crap I couldn’t have written a more fake sounding story if I tried. Next time try to give your characters a more dynamic personality instead of “here’s the nice lgbt girl, her black boyfriend cookie-baking gentlesir, and EVIL TRUMP SUPPORTING RACIST INCEL FATTY CHILD MOLESTER SPAWN OF SATAN!!!”, just try not to lump all of the negative qualities into one “supreme villain” character, it gets boring fast.  While the backstory of the boyfriend was nice, it was really heavy-handed in delivery and was entirely irrelevant from the plot, making the rest of the story way less believable as a whole.  The nail in the coffin however is the incredibly clear political narrative which makes the whole thing play out as a sort of deranged progressive fantasy about wrecking a trump supporter who is also the most horrible person to ever exist. Political themes work great in stories where it pushes the boundaries between right and wrong but you clearly pick your side and champion it as flawless while condemning and demonizing the other. A good way you could’ve strengthened your narrative would’ve been to make the parents oldschool conservative, having taught the son certain values (such as sexual modesty) before he takes it to an extreme and goes off the rails and becomes a hyper-right incel, making the parents reconsider their values. [end]
[start] Incels are bad, so are the fake stories being written about them. If this is true your son is a horrible person, but you're a terrible parent. I'm not just talking about not disciplining your fake son properly, but actively and knowingly putting your fake daughter and others in danger by not reporting your son to authorities during this time. The fake school that didn't kick him out, report him to authorities, or the fake girls parents who didn't press charges.   If this story were true, you wouldn't have created such a measured and paced out story detailing all your shitty parenting decisions or highlighted specific phrases associated with the incel community you somehow committed perfectly to memory during these moments. In the long and far-fetched shot that any of this story occurred, you did nothing as your son committed sexual assault and exhibited patterns of behavior similar to that of a serial killer. I don't buy it, but if it's true you deserve zero sympathy. [end]
[start] Fake af but it's a fun story to read :) [end]
[start] So how are you liking all the free time you have, now that you’ve gotten this creative writing degree?  [end]

[TITLE] Fuck Donald Trump [TITLE]
[start] Even putting politics aside, it's genuinely astonishing that there are so many negative qualities rolled up into one human being. [end]
[start] As someone who both lives in Texas, as well as who works at a store that happens to sell guns and ammunition and can clearly see and hear all the far right residents coming in "to stock up and prepare for the days ahead" I am genuinely scared not only for myself but for the world in knowing that these type of people live among us. I never understood why it was so hard for people to want to lift others up despite our differences and the fact that 45 came in and said/did everything he has over the past 4 years KILLS ME knowing that he only made it worse, and I have no idea how trump supporters genuinely do not see the wrong in their actions or opinions; ofcourse I am not correct about everything, but what the fuck, does it really take an education to realize maybe we SHOULDN'T support this dick with multiple accounts of racism, and sexism and xenophobia, etc. that ALL date WAYYYY back before his presidency?? I am all the way with you !! fuck donald trump, and fuck you if you support him [end]
[start] Its not even fun hating him anymore and anytime someone else hates on him I get annoyed I just want him deleted from existence and to never have to hear him or anybody who complains about him ever again [end]
[start] It’s completely mind blowing. I’m 24, and I’ve always made a conscious effort to remain as moderate as I can though I’m naturally pretty liberal. I always try to understand the other side as much as I can because the us vs. them mindset helps nobody.   But god fucking damn, this presidency has broken me. It defies logic and reason that half of this country can look at Trump and see anything other than a lunatic. I’m further to the left than I’ve ever been at this point. The division this man has (it seems, actively) tried to sow in this country is just fucking terrible. It just makes me feel sick to my stomach. How can ANYONE support this? [end]
[start] Plus he has one of the worst make up artists there is [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] {𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠 𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑎𝑙}    All jokes aside you could list all his bad qualities without mentioning politics and he'd still be scum. [end]
[start] Happy Cake Day! November 3rd Flush the Turd. [end]
[start] I was still until the first debate hesitant to call him a white supremacist (I'm a Canadian who doesn't follow politics all too closely but me and the boys had some drinking games during the debates) but when he was asked to disavow a white supremacist organization and his words were "Stand down and stand by." Just... wow. Your president literally just said "White supremacist militia, wait for my order but you may be needed." Genuinely fucking wow. [end]
[start] You forgot pedo and child molestor. Court documents state Epstein and trump fought over who would take a 13 year old’s virginity. [end]
[start] What saddens me is the fact that he has something akin to a 96% approval rate (WSJ August 2020) from Republicans.  Let that sink in.  With all of the shit he's done, 96% of the Republican party still approves of him.  SMH.  And 42% of Americans in general still think he's doing a great job.  That's roughly 140 MILLION Americans. Where have we gone wrong with these people that they would still cling to him - that they can't see what's right in front of their face?  IMHO, they are the direct result of the dumbing down of America.  Like Gotti, he's a teflon Don.  Nothing seems to stick to him - not the "pussy grabbing" comment when he was a candidate - which would have ended anyone else's run, but seems to have just been put down to "That's just him" - despite his many sexual harassment and rape charges - and not the impeachment during his presidency.  He's said that he could shoot someone in Times Square and his supporters would still love him.   He hasn't done that.  Instead he's killed over 231,000 Americans in a much more subtle, insidious way.  And he's ALSO killing THEM, yet they follow him like lambs to the slaughter, packing into his Covidpalooza Nuremberg rallies, which have been responsible for at least 30,000 cases (so far) and at least 700 deaths (so far).  And anyone with a brain knows that, two weeks from the weekend of November 1, there'll be a LOT more people added to BOTH of those totals.  They are LITERALLY a DEATH CULT.  Even if he's voted out, these people have had a taste of power, and, worse than that, ACCEPTANCE, and they are NOT going to go quietly away - which is why Trump's going to hide behind an "unscalable wall" (which is about as unscalable as the roughly 30 feet of new border wall that's been built, with US TAXPAYER DOLLARS, that blows over in high wind) on election night.  I'd be willing to bet that he's going to let the people he denigrates (his own supporters) fight his battles for him on the streets, just like he let others go in his place when he dodged the draft something like five times.  He won't get his hands dirty - he'll let his highly armed, mindless Proud Boys, etc. go wild, all while decrying BLM protests, etc.  Sigh.  America is truly fucked, one way or the other. [end]

[start] A few close loved ones confided in me that they voted for trump and I don’t really know how to take that... I feel that supporting trump says a lot.    They know I’m disappointed but I don’t know if they know how much.  They are totally different people in my eyes now.  I will pay more in taxes to get this monster out.  He is so fucking terrible.  This isn’t an agree to disagree thing.  He’s a real life monster, perpetuating and creating hate.  He’s killing people!  Some of my loved ones voted for him to save money on taxes and that makes me sick. [end]
[start] I'm pretty iffy on Biden, I think he's pretty meh overall, but he would be so much better than anything Trump could ever dream of being. My husband is a teacher, and Trump seems pretty keen on fucking up education. Biden has some things he's genuinely passionate about that aren't hateful, like healthcare. I'm so sick of every movement Trump makes oozing hatred and willful ignorance. [end]
[start] you forgot adulterer. why he's held up as some kind of beacon of morality is wild to me. [end]
[start] He's the absolute epitome of everything I hate in a human. It's hard for me to believe he actually exists. [end]
[start] I mean, say what you want about the man, that’s your right (maybe not for long), but you have to to admit that he has done some incredible things. They’ve all been bad, but they’ve been incredibly bad. Like unfathomably bad. Unbelievably bad. And you have to admit that it takes a certain kind of piece of shit to fuck it up this badly. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Somebody today described Trump to me as "incredibly genuine, intelligent, and humble"  I thought they were being sarcastic and laughed. They were serious. [end]
[start] Heard a dude from Ohio being interviewed today. He said he voted for Trump because he (the voter) has personally gained during Trump’s term in terms of his investment gains.  He couldn’t care less about all of this douchebag’s personal qualities, business failings, treatment of women & minorities etc. That’s the problem. [end]
[start] "Everything that made America truly great is now in the toilet because of him and his zombie cult horde."  It's not that I disagree with your sentiments: I despise Trump with the white-hot blinding passion of 10,000-billion suns simultaneously going super nova, but (and this is a YUGE but), Trump is only a symptom of a much more virulent disease.  If it wasn't Trump, it would be Sarah Palin or Michele Bachman or Kelly Loeffler or Louie Gohmert or Newt Gingrich or the 100's of other RWNJ's waiting in the wings to make that grand Nuremberg Rally speech to the assembled, jack-booted, straight-armed saluting pustules that make up \~ 30% of all US voters. You know, Triumph of the Will and all that jazz. [end]
[start] I’m so fucking sick of thinking about him, talking about him, losing family members to his appalling, immoral cult. All I’ve ever wanted is his loss in a landslide, and him to be prosecuted to the fullest extent. [end]
[start] I claimed my free Reddit reward just to give it to this post, thank you [end]
[start] Considering he's killed over 230000 Americans with his covid is a hoax bullshit, is it fair to call him the biggest domestic terrorist in American History [end]
[start] You forgot the one quality that made his presidency possible: he's a con man. [end]
[start] He also doesn’t have a pet. Who lives in the White House and doesn’t have pets? [end]
[start] When he loses he needs to tried for the hundreds of thousands of americans that died because of his apathy. He needs to catch a rope like Mussolini and the rest of the facists through history [end]
[start] It's super ironic to me that he represent the kind of tyrannical leadership that the founding fathers were trying to get away from, no? [end]
[start] I love this [end]
[start] It's hard when the people who support him have literal mental issues like no sane human is so delusional [end]
[start] 💯 on board with this message! [end]
[start] Agree 100% [end]
[start] The fact that he still gets so many votes is proof that he is nothing but a symptom and that the US surely isn't going to change overnight. [end]
[start] Gen John Kelly(former chief of staff) said trump "is the most flawed person" he has ever known.  The depths of denial by these republicans zealots is remarkable. Even if a general, (who historically has last say to republicans on just about everything ) speaks out against him they will not see the truth.   This guy has to go. We are all fucking exhausted and if you're not and you're supporting trump you can go get fucked as YOU are the problem. Not whatever issue, person, entity, norm, more, institution you are vilifying. [end]
[start] I love you! I love all of you! We can make this right! Vote him out! [end]
[start] I don't lose too much sleep over Donald Trump. He's one shitty person. What keeps me up is the fact that enough people are okay with his behavior that he was elected president, continued to be president for 4 years, and is in a somewhat close race (who knows what'll happen). My issue is not a political one (i could give a shit democrat or republican), it's a human one. How are people as a whole this... stupid.... I really don't know how else to say it. And the "I don't like trump but I'm a conservative so I justify it" is NOT an excuse. You vote for a person, not a party. Trump being elected president by our country blows. my. mind.  \[Edit\] It's completely changed my world view, and how I view society as a whole. It's devastating. [end]
[start] Hot take central today [end]
[start] "But its not about the person, he brought so many jobs" going back to work after the initial shutdown is not a new job!   I had to stop replying to this person because there is no getting through to them.  Also fuck trump. [end]
[start] I'm sorry, you forgot nepotist.     Continue. [end]
[start] I’m so disheartened that so many Americans voted for him what is wrong with our country is the real issue. They willing are voting for a despicable human being. How can they believe that he will govern ethically and morally when he is lacking these character traits and has proven time and time again that is true, [end]
[start] It's kind of amazing. Of course there are good people that support Trump, but the fact is that the worst groups in our society all support him. That should speak volumes. [end]
[start] But perhaps not literally. It sounds pretty gross. [end]
[start] Yes the Evangelical Christians have a lot of soul searching to do as they have supported this clown president yet he has NONE of their supposed values or are such values truly more aligned with Trump himself 🤔 [end]
[start] it scares me that anyone on earth can vote for him. [end]
[start] Funny how freedom of speech only works for Trump supporters if it’s something that benefits him [end]
[start] Happy cake day, we all should have a wish on your r/day🌊🌊🌊 sharing your sentiment and applauding your wise words... and I’m not even and American. [end]
[start] I voted blue today! 🥰💙 [end]
[start] This thread and post is the epitome of radicalized thought and divide in the country. Trump is the furthest thing from a “good guy”. But there are people comparing him to hitler, people saying he’s a rapist and all sorts of unbacked claims. The way people in this thread are speaking of the right and Trump is exactly how radicalized republicans are speaking of the left and of Biden. If you speak that way (I.e as a radical) your part of the problem of division in America no matter your political affiliation. Psa: Recognize this country’s problem is devision. Not any specific president, not any specific political party, the problem IS division. DONT be part of the problem [end]
[start] i cant help but think about how the us is more divided on politics now then ever before. its absolutely wild to me that people are legitimately threatening to harm others, violently harassing, and actually assaulting others because they didnt vote for trump. [end]
[start] It's very hard to wrap my head around the fact that millions of people see the same nonsensical tweets, stupid statements at rallies, and dangerous policies concerning climate, and still vote for this mf'er! After he's gone, I'll be very wary of who I befriend from now on. [end]
[start] Take it easy bro. Hate tends to consume the hater... [end]
[start] There is no such thing as a good Trump supporter. They are all either stupid, evil or both. [end]

[start] I'm standing on my chair screaming "FUCK YES! PREEEAACH!!" after reading this. My aunt said, "I don't know about his policies; I can't get past how repugnant he is as a man." and I keep coming back to that. How can we even pretend he was ever a leader when he's barely a human?  I believe that we must live our lives with peace and compassion in the front of our minds. With that in mind, I refuse to let myself wish death on **anyone**... A life in prison is perfectly acceptable, though. [end]

Jfc I worked my ass off for years, and now I don’t even get to go to my own graduation because this fuck face decided to “own the libs” by disbanding the pandemic response team and basically outright telling people NOT to use masks and follow CDC guidelines?! FUCK TRUMP. Motherfucking shitstain.    And not attending my own graduation is absolutely SO SMALL compared to people who have literally died, lost their jobs/houses/etc. Fuck Trump and fuck you if you vote for him. You’re complacent in this. [end]
[start] Fuck Donald trump!   -2020 [end]
[start] I hope everybody here voted! Fuck donald trump! [end]
[start] Imagine thinking Trump is worse than George W. Bush. [end]
[start] Hell yeah. While we are on the subject. The Rambo flags that his mouth breathers put on their house or cars that super impose trumps face on Rambos body. Fuck you too, you dumb cunt. He’s a fat ducking slob you pee brained twats. Also he’s got nothing in fucking common with you, aside from the fact that he’s racist, in fact let’s be real here for a second Trump doesn’t know the difference between white trash and the black folks, he merely seems them as tools to get where he needs to get to. Quit getting fooled you fucking assholes. Either that or please just die off already the world doesn’t need racist fuck bags. [end]
[start] Yep with any luck he wont be a topic of discussion soon enough. Unless its his trials, in which case i cant wait [end]
[start] Also, his policies are shit. So even if you looked past all his inexcusable personal traits, you should only be happy with his policies if you earn over $400k a year, have tons of money invested in stocks and a good enough broker to keep up with his volatile influence on the market, or own a business renting golf caddies.  And personally speaking anyone who earns over $400k and isn’t happy to pay a bit more tax to support the country and society that enabled them well you can simply go fuck yourself. [end]
[start] Big facts! Never have felt so strongly about an election but this it is crazy what kind of hate we are seeing today. [end]
[start] Anyone who supports Donald Trump is dead to me.  Trump is worse than a racist, he just exploits it. He knows it is wrong but also knows it serves him well. He is not a true racist. I have known people that claimed they were racist but would always be cool with anyone. They just had a mental problem that when they were alone they would claim they are a racist. I have known many fake racists. They have mental problems. I knew a japanese guy with a swatstika tattooed to his chest and he was in peni. They were just a bunch of heroin junkies with mommy and daddy issues [end]

[start] Let me take you a while back.   It's late 2016. I've got a few more weeks before my 7th semester for engg.  Everything was going smooth. No oofs no buts.  One morning I wake up to my phone beeping 5times a second cuz my college whatsapp group was being spammed by people.  I wake up.... What's causing the spamfest I ask myself.   In the next 10 seconds I proceed to read the biggest Oof in near American history. Donald Trump was president.  I stood up. Went to my kitchen. Took a big swig of my rum. Went back to sleep thinking, y'all done fuckin up....now we suffer. [end]
[start] I'm day drinking due to the accuracy of this post [end]
[start] And don’t forget his Vile, abhorrent children. May they all be charged with any laws broken. [end]
[start] I will greatly enjoy his funerals [end]
[start] Fuck trump fuck D trump fuck Donald Trump and his trump family too! : Why is abortion a big deal, we have larger issues like racism, violence, health care, immigration, world's health against covid, homelessness, the environment, tuition education, jobs ; let women decide their choice of having an unwanted child do to a rape or personal issue. Dont vote for racist trump people  time for change !!   Fuck trump and judge Barret and all the Republicans in the senate that agree with trump fuck you too [end]
[start] Well said. [end]
[start] Agree👍 [end]
[start] I will say everything that made America "great" has all went down the toilet before him. But I'm with ya, fuck Donald Trump, hope he dies in prison [end]
[start] The piece of shit is gonna whine and cry so much the next few months and then we’ll never have to hear his dumb ass mouth open ever again. [end]
[start] Trump supporters lack education and are mentally ill. [end]
[start] The biggest mystery to me is... I remember learning about people exactly like Donald Trump in middle school and high school, and I didn't excel at history. This guy is nuts.  If nothing else, his, his administration's, and the Republican party's attempts to have broad swaths of votes delayed or illegitimized, in the midst of a global pandemic no less, is really just a short skip away from some dictator of a third-world country "winning an election" with 97% of the vote. Really, set aside the last four years – considering just his hints that he'll declare victory prematurely combined with the material and verbal attacks on the USPS, mail-in voting, counting mail-in ballots in PA, and drive-through voting in TX – this guy is totally, undeniably nuts.  It is not an exaggeration to say that these attacks on our democratic norms are completely unprecedented in our nation's modern history. Our country has backslid considerably in four short years, and I'm totally ~~bewildered~~ ~~disappointed~~ a lot of things. [end]
[start] Imagine living in a county with an actual tyrant and then reading this lol. [end]
[start]  But apart from that, I assume you think he’s ok, right? [end]
[start] People forget that he’s not the great businessman he pretends to be. All his money was inherited from Daddy, every time her tried to launch his own idea it always goes up in flames. [end]
[start] Even Before  becoming the president trump was a horrible person . He just got more power now.  He doesn't know what the average Joe goes through.  He was always rich. To think his supporters actually think he cares about them is ridiculous.  Brain washed people . [end]
[start] America deserves exactly the government it elects and everything that comes it's way because of that election. If we want better, we have to demand it and vote for it. [end]
[start] There is a song about this [end]
[start] Someone gonna be mad in the morning when they find out Trump wins again omega lol [end]
[start] Agreed. Fuck that waste of space. [end]
[start] Well fuck me I guess lol [end]
[start] The thing is, nobody who supports Trump falls for this. [end]
[start] I support Donald Trump. [end]
[start] I don’t support Donald trump but I voted for him. Stinks that we had to roll with him again, we had 10 other candidates that would have smoked Biden’s ass this year. [end]
[start] Yesss!!! [end]
[start] Part of the problem, at least, is that people at large aren’t educated enough or don’t have the critical thinking skills necessary to navigate this helpscape of narratives and information.    I’m not claiming to know it all, but I think you have to look at the situation from all angles and you have to know a bit about those things. You can’t just narrow it down to one tag line like “I want America to be great again so I’m voting trump” and call it a day. There is prerequisite knowledge to make a decision lol. american politics, history, technology, social media, Logic, debate, psychology, sociology, environmental science, current events, etc... etc... and these people just don’t seem to want to entertain any form of complex thought.   Idk if it’s because I have a naturally logical mind that I see through the bullshit, or my education allows it, or if it’s because of all that acid I’ve taken that it all seems so clearly ridiculous. Or maybe we’re just decent human beings, that could be it lol.   In any case, you’re not alone. I feel you. [end]
[start] I feel ya. Can u believe that there are people who support this guy? I see how nazis came into power now. Its easy with stupid people. [end]
[start] I don’t understand his crazy cult because I don’t understand idiocy and ignorance, but what I really don’t understand is how religious people like Christians are so out of touch and hypocritical about what their religion truly is and support this guy when he is the literal antithesis of good and inherent evil. [end]
[start] Don't just fuck Donald Trump, FUCK HIM UP. [end]
[start] What a brave and original statement! Orange man is indeed bad. How could I have not seen it before [end]
[start] I’m not American so I mostly just follow American politics for entertainment and laughs but one thing that infuriated me and almost bought me to tears recently-    A girl made a vid in which she told her Trump supporting mother that she met a guy and she really liked him but the guy had a few sexual assault accusations, he’d been bankrupt a few times, he’d had a few wives etc (describing Trump).   The mother groaned and said “well, come on, this guy sounds like a scumbag, don’t trust him.”   And the girl said “mom, that’s YOUR president.”  What was so incredibly infuriating and heartbreaking was how the mother immediately shrugged it off and started laughing at how distressed her daughter sounded. It honestly shook me and made me realise, they will blindly follow that hate train to its end. [end]
[start] 👌🏼 [end]
[start] and 50% of Americans love him. Haha our society is a disgrace [end]
[start] Amen [end]
[start] Are you really ready for 4 more years of his fucked up shit [end]
[start] Well said [end]
[start] As we say here in Scotland, Trump is a cunt. [end]
[start] FUCK trump(always under cased)! Never capitalize that cunts name. Fuck trump. [end]
[start] I’ll be happy when he’s in prison. [end]
[start] Haha,  well reddit is a good place to post this because they will gather around and agree with and pat you on the back. The rest of us just laugh at how triggered you are. [end]
[start] #TRUMP VIRUS. [end]
[start] i hope he loses and cries [end]
[start] One of the best posts I've read in a long time. Agreed on all fronts [end]
[start] Thank you <3 Well said. He is a disgrace to my America. [end]
[start] Woooow look at all the Trump bots.  Reporting in from Canada:  the whole world thinks DT is a loser, and the people who vote for him all have big time daddy issues. [end]
[start] I hope as soon as his protection ends, he's hauled in front of judges for his crimes. I, for one, want answers about his Epstein rape case and how Maxwell recruited one of his employees from his goddamn house. [end]
[start] Lmao. This is the most uninformed thing I’ve read. But seeing as how it’s Reddit I’m not surprised by the retarded views. [end]
[start] Donald Trump is proof that this country has bred petulant selfish children at scale. If we were were to get into a real war, seeing how these people act and think, we would be at a severe disadvantage. [end]
[start] Can you back all those claims with facts? [end]
[start] The people I’ve seen that support him are literally stupid, idiotic, and just don’t make sense. [end]
[start] Yes [end]
[start] It's all good, he's losing. [end]
[start] Thank you for saying so eloquently everything I think and feel about him. He is a sorry excuse for a human being and I hope he rots in a pool of his own filth. [end]
[start] I could listen to you all day long. After the election these people don't go away, they still exist. how will we deal with that? [end]
[start] Wow dude I cant believe you would say all these things, most trump supporters don't even have the vernacular to understand what you're saying the poor idiots [end]
[start] I love you for this. That is all. [end]
[start] And fuck Moscow Mitch too! [end]
[start] Fuck45 [end]
[start] amen brother [end]
[start] I read this in Stephen Fry’s voice. Also, I wholeheartedly agree. [end]
[start] This isn’t even political, it’s just pure facts. [end]
[start] dump the trump ! [end]
[start] Fuck him straight to jail.  Him and Mitch and Barr [end]
[start] I don't blame you for being so totally annoyed by an arrogant, lying hypocrite that has done nothing but dispel hate like candy. The world has become far worse because of his 4 years of chaos. [end]
[start] Just your healthy reminder that Trump has a pending rape case for having raped a 13 year old girl. Trump refuses to provide his DNA (which would prove his innocence if he didnt do it). [end]
[start] Also: fuck Bolsonaro. He is a Brazilian Trump and Trump's lap dog. He is also destroying Brasil and everything it stands for. [end]
[start] Yea, what you said. [end]
[start] And a happy cake day to you! [end]
[start] Right on!!! 💯% correct. Fuck the Cheeto skinned cancer. [end]
[start] FUCK DONALD-PIECE-OF-SHIT-TRUMP.  I hope they prosecute him and put his racist ass in prison. [end]
[start] Ok I can see how your going with this and how you hate trump. Don’t forget that there are people who support trump just because he is republican and so they don’t vote for a democrat. That’s stupid, just rely on what you think is right. Remember that not all trump supporters are rednecks. Only like 3/4 of them. Anyway I am not sure which ones are really good to have because, yeah Trump is a jerk, and Biden doesn’t really sound like he has a plan. Biden sounds like he wants to be president so that he can just be president. Please don’t get mad at me. I like this account and I don’t wanna be murdered . [end]
[start] As a non american. I think you guys are screwed either way.. [end]
[start] Oh, come on! He's not that bad!  No, I'm totally kidding. He's fucking terrible. [end]
[start] At the end of the night, roughly half this country will continue to support him after everything. I want to know, what would it take?? [end]
[start] I agree [end]
[start] Couldn’t agree more. Fuck Donald Trump! [end]
[start] Fuck me then [end]
[start] He is the embodiment of American television and I’m not surprised that poorly educated Americans love him, because he’s “entertaining”.  The majority of Americans don’t know anything. He panders to their sense of fear [end]
[start] We did it [end]
[start] Preach [end]
[start] Preach [end]
[start] You have been brainwashed by the media [end]
[start] Donald Trump hasn't done anything for this country in the last 4 years and it amazes me that people think he has. He is without a doubt the worst president we have had in the history of America. America has never been more divided than it is now and it's scary to see how many people still support him after everything [end]
[start] I wish we could have Obama again, he was the best president in my opinion [end]
[start] Ironically, Trump's almost black out bingo card of terrible human qualities is what allowed him to get away with the last four years and why his voter base still supports him. The combination of reprehensible qualities, utter lack of intellect or learning, and personality failings combine to create an individual whose poor overall example of humanity is over the top even for a caricature. Rather than accept that this is, in fact, possibly one of the worst, stupidest, most amoral, completely incompetent gutter scraping examples of humanity to ever exist, they instead accept the party line that the leftist libtards will say and do anything at all to smear him.   Then, when led to believe that the libtards are 'bad' this not only makes him immune to judgment or censure from his own supporters but each example of his terrible behavior only serves to reinforce their hatred for the left for yet another 'smear' thrown at their guy, who angers the left so badly that 'he must be doing something right' even though they themselves can't actually name nor do they know of a single thing that would qualify. Reinforced by GOP propaganda in right wing media with the normal assortment of talking heads, their assuredness of him being 'their guy' becomes so heavily cemented that no amount of logic, reason, or evidence will sway them.   Once this state of fanaticism is reached, they will do and believe anything their idol says. They gonna take our jobs, rape our women, and force addictive drugs into our children? We better act now! They're gonna make us all commies? We can't let them get into office. They've rigged the election? We gotta stop em! They're gonna burn down our cities and homes in protest? We have the right to defend our homes and lives with violence, preemptively, even.   This is what has been created, what we're up against. This sort of dickery is what creates religious extremist movements, and perpetuates them, because the policies that get enacted further erode education, opportunity, and basic necessities for survival, until they will literally die for the first person who looks like an authority that seems to have 'the' answer. We've seen it in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and now we're seeing it here. And like all of the prior nations, it's because greedy fuckers in the American government decided that their wallets were more important than the rule of law or the lives of brown people. [end]
[start] His followers on Twitter are so out of touch with reality. It really is the worst thing to see. [end]
[start] Get out and vote him out people [end]
[start] USA is a fucked up country. [end]
[start] Come on man that’s uncalled for. He’s the POTUS of the USA.   You are being way to easy on him.   He is also a pedophile, treasonous, disgusting death cult leader who is personally responsible for 700 deaths due to his draconian rallies. [end]
[start] he raped someone? do the police know? why hasnt he been arrested? do you have evidence? [end]
[start] It's amazing that you can be so outrageously hateful and get away with it, but if someone said the same exact things about a democrat they'd risk being banned.  You get away with this nonsense because the Reddit establishment protects this sort of hate speech, and won't ever allow anyone to go toe to toe with you and get the upper hand. [end]
[start] Politics or not, either candidates or not, is honestly amazing how money can buy you literally control over a full country's existence and future. And it's not just the US, is nearly everywhere. [end]
[start] Yes I agree [end]
[start] Am I missing the point of this self forum? Does this belong here? [end]
[start] Trump support is an IQ test. If you support trump, you are a fucking moron. Or super wealthy and don’t give a shit about anything else other than your own wealth. [end]
[start] What’s as astonishing is that OP’s post only touches on about a third of how horrible trump is. [end]
[start] I made this username for all the assholes tomorrow. I get to tell them to get fucked, you lost, get over it snowflake. I can't wait. FUCK TRUMP and his Cult45 with their red hat dunce caps! [end]
[start] Leave my president alone! He is so rich and helps me cope with my insecurities as a small dicked patriot! [end]
[start] You left our pedophile. [end]
[start] Yikes. So brave.  Lmao [end]
[start] Your so brave for your revolutionary view point [end]
[start] So if u guys can talk about politics in this sub, may I just state the fact that "I use Arch" [end]
[start] I think the worst thing about Donald Trump (aside from being sexist, racist, etc) is, as you said it, his zombie cult horde. Because his supporters do truly behave like a cult. I mean have you seen the video of the group of Trump voters in their trucks surrounding the Biden campaign van? Its fucked up, I mean they will literally do anything for daddy trump to be elected. [end]
[start] What's worse is that he isn't the only one with all those qualities in a political position [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] He’s a dick for sho...but are you alright? The way you’re describing him here it’s like he banged your mom or something. [end]

[start] HELL YES. COULDN’T HAVE SAID IT BETTER MYSELF. [end]
[start] I feel like you should have your opinion but telling me to fuck off us a lil harsh. I only support him because I would rather him then Biden [end]
[start] He has literally raped a child, I don't know why the fu k this man is still standing. [end]
[start] Yes, Trump and his supporters can fuck right off, and crawl back under the rock they all came from [end]
[start] You sound pretty unhinged and should probably seek help. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] No u. [end]
[start] And never forget that Trump wants to fuck his own daughter [end]
[start] Reddit moment [end]
[start] Don’t vote for him, but vote! [end]
[start] I could kind of get voting for him in 2016, since a lot of people wanted some kind of radical change and felt they weren't being heard. And we didn't know for sure what a Trump presidency would look like (although let's be real, it wasn't hard to make a prediction 🙄). But if you're still voting for him in 2020? *That* is just incomprehensible to me. [end]
[start] This is disgusting that Reddit allows these kinds of comments. [end]
[start] sure, but he's got great hair. [end]
[start] Hahahaha TDS [end]
[start] You gonna be very sad in 24 hours my friend. [end]
[start] Odd that this post shows up as a popular one but there isn't any anti-Biden stuff you can find. Shows how much a shit show this site has become [end]
[start] [removed] [end]

[TITLE] In regard to /r/The_Donald's outrage at being kept off of /r/all [TITLE]
[start] Locked - So many of you, regardless of your take on OPs point, for or against, can't seem to go more than 3 minutes without calling each other a various amalgamation of names, insults, and threats. That won't fly here. [end]
[start] I make a point to stay out of 99% of political threads, so being able to filter the Donald, enoughtrumpspam, politics, and several others from all has personally made my experience lately much better.   To keep with the analogy in the op, I threw my headphones on and kept on enjoying my meal.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] What's really amazing to me is when trolls treat people like shit and then act shocked and offended when their targets actually do something about it.  Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences. [end]
[start] I'd just like to say that I've never commented on r/self before, but I do appreciate that I can either upvote or down vote this post as I please because I'm not banned from here for posting in another sub.  [end]
[start] My problem is just how many submissions from /r/the_donald make it to the front page.  The algorithm for /r/all just needs a cap. Simple as that.  No subreddit can have more than, say, two posts in the top 50 at one time.  I don't actually want to filter the_donald completely. But any group totally dominating /r/all annoys me.   Edit: And I should add that I don't just mean "hot".  I browse /r/all/top/this_hour for fresh content. I just had to filter out the_donald because enough is enough. It might be high energy but it's low quality content and its tedious to wade through.    [end]
[start] **upfront tldr - Donald mods were cheating the system to appear on the front page and seem more interesting than they really were. Now they're being forced to obey the same rules everyone else already does, and it turns out their posts, if playing fair, were usually not interesting enough to make the front page. To them, this equals persecution because nobody else is forced to obey rules that only they were breaking.**   It's not even that they've been removed from the front page of /r/all -- I still see them all the time. It's that they've been denied their tactic of abusing stickied posts to cheat the algorithm into letting them spam the front page.    For anyone that somehow still doesn't know: the algorithm doesn't just consider how many votes a post has, but also time since creation, and how quickly those votes were awarded. The mods abused the system by stickying brand new posts, so that everyone on the sub would upvote them because they were instantly and always visible. Even if it was only like 200 upvotes, the fact that they all happened in the first half hour meant the algorithm would see that as a wildly popular post that needed to go to the front page. Then the post would be unstickied so it didn't seem suspicious, but by then it was already in everyone's faces.    Now, stickied dolan posts aren't allowed on the front page, and suddenly /r/The_Donald isn't appearing anymore. They're crying like they've been censored, but really they've just been forced to acknowledge the truth: the bulk of their posts are not interesting enough, even to their own sub, to *legitimately* reach the front page more then once every day or two. If you guys want front page dominance again, stop posting shitty content -- You're not being persecuted just because you're not allowed to cheat anymore.   Edit - apparently only dolan's stickies can't make it to /r/all  Edit 2 - in response to an avalanche of the same few questions over and over, I'll post them here      **there's technically no rule against it, so it's totally fine**     Intentionally abusing a loophole to such a severe degree is indeed not *technically* against the rules. Because that's how a loophole works. But you can't expect an entire sub to continuously brigade the front page for several months and nothing to happen    **it can't be called abuse if no rule existed**     See the above response. Look at it this way: there's no rule that says mods can't limit posts from just your sub, yet you have no qualms calling this action abuse. Clearly some part of you does understand what abuse actually is -- and that a rule existing has nothing to do with it -- but you are only selectively listening to it    **we're being singled out, this is persecution. Nobody else has to suffer this!**      If you put the loudest kid in the nursery into the quiet corner, are you singling them out? Absolutely, yes.    **other subs do this, why is it only not okay for us to do it?**     There's a difference between a sports sub sticking the announcement of which team just won the world series, and /r/The_Donald sticking literally everything always    **spez is bad at code, do you know about the sticky glitch?**     To be fair, it only affects you when you try to sticky abuse a post to the front page. Just stop doing that. Try posting interesting content, and not just an endless steam of circlejerking memes and shitposts -- The quality posts will appear on the front page naturally, without you having to cheat [end]
[start] It's one thing to add a filter on for r/all, but to force that filter onto everyone is something else entirely. Some people may actually enjoy the content, hence why the subreddit is so popular.  [end]
[start] Being able to filter out The_Donald, EnoughTrumpSpam, Politics, and now Self is just fantastic. Some of us just come here for the laughs. [end]
[start] I hate Trump and love Bernie as much as the next left wing redditor, but...  /r/politics was just as big of an obnoxious sack of cancerous shit. [end]
[start] What I don't get is if they added a feature to filter subreddits from /r/all, why make their sticky posts adhere to different rules than the rest of reddit? [end]
[start] a politcial post in self... you made the list, im really getting my moneys worth out of this filter thing! [end]

[start] I don't have a problem with being able to filter /r/all  I don't have a problem with the administration deciding that sticky posts won't show up on /r/all  I do have a problem with the administration deciding that only sticky posts from /r/The_Donald won't show up on /r/all  If it's a problem for one subreddit, it should be a problem for all subreddits [end]
[start] A lot of the outrage coming from /r/the_donald comes from the fact that /r/politics has made it quite clear that they are pro-Hillary and it's a default sub that continually makes /r/all, usually with anti-Trump rhetoric, as seen right now. That's how I found t_d before it was even reaching /r/all, I just got sick and tired of reading all the anti-trump posts on /r/all, and that's how the sub grew.  [end]
[start] Which other subreddit isn't allowed to have stickied posts on the front page? Or perhaps more importantly, has stickied threads that hit /r/all immediately (and permanently) made invisible outside of the subreddit?  Seems to me there's objectively a different set of standards applied to /r/The_Donald than there is to every other subreddit on the website. One rule for thee, another for me.  I also wonder if this post would have the same sentiment as it does if it was /r/self that was being censored. I imagine that wouldn't be the case. [end]

Beyond the obvious "fuck spez" comments, where is the actual harassment? I'm being 100% serious. Maybe I'm just an asshole and don't see it, but I am more than willing to accept that I actually am an asshole and have my eyes opened to what I'm clearly blind to. [end]
[start] Imo if /r/the_donald gets taken off /all then /r/enoughtrumpspam deserves it too. It is just as bad if not worse than TD by a long shot [end]
[start] So they're the Harley riders of the forum? Good to know. [end]
[start] I'm not against that sub, nor for banning anyone from reddit, but the constant shitpost **SPAM** is simply annoying. Thanks /u/spez for filtering. [end]
[start] Your argument and analogy makes sense, the problem is that /r/all is made up of popular posts, and posts are made popular by voting (upvotes and downvotes) so just because /r/the_donald is "the loud guy in the restaurant" doesn't make the fact that they have a lot of upvotes any less significant. /r/all is about votes, and the_donald gets votes, that is how /r/all works. If you think it should work differently fine that's your opinion, but the current mechanisms by which it work are democratic. [end]
[start] Except you act like /r/politics isn't its own circlejerk with highly upvoted post. [end]
[start] What about when hillary and bernie subs dominated the front page? [end]
[start] But /r/EnoughTrumpSpam and it's offshoots are doing the exact same thing you're saying here and you're not mad about them yelling their crap in /r/all. [end]
[start] > I don't care if you're on /r/all. I can scroll past it.   *writes 4 paragraphs about why you do care and can't scroll past it* [end]
[start] r/politics is like if r/NFL only supported NFC teams and wantonly disparaged and downvoted supporters of AFC teams.  r/Donald is like an AFC team subreddit like the Oakland Raiders for example, that everybody counted out and shat on - but they won the SuperBowl anyway.  Then people wanted to ban or censor the Raider subreddit because it was a daily reminder of how badly they fucked up. [end]
[start] This would make sense if /r/politics wasn't just as bad and got away with it for years. [end]
[start] Enoughtrumpspam and r/politcs are just as bad im personally pro trump but the whole election has gotten so toxic ive filtered all politc based subreddits  [end]
[start] Why is it so hard for everyone to have the same rules INCLUDING The_Donald? Just add a filter to R/all(They did) so people could personalize their experience on Reddit instead of -even though some people think it's deserved- singling out a specific sub and taking away a right that every sub has simply because they figured out how to manipulate the stickies where they consistently show up in R/All. I would have no problem with other subs doing this because T_D was doing it, but now if people start doing this will they have their stickies taken away for abusing the system as well?   Before I can see why people complained, they didn't have the option to filter. Now they do. Filter it out and get on with it.   My opinion is every Reddit SHOULD BE EQUAL and EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO FILTER. If the mods of any sub figure out an interesting way to use the stickies in any sub then claps for them, filter it out.   Trump supporter and T_D user out.   Wonder what insults will come flooding into my inbox for this.   Have a good day everyone!  [end]
[start] I just find it funny how much they hate /u/spez as they sit in their moms basement for hours using the website he created.  If they had any self-respect they would find somewhere else to do their thing.   [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] You really have to be ignorant to not understand that conservative views are being silenced across all forms of media. Google/Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, NYTimes, Washington Post, Reddit, CNN, etc have all engaged in trying to shut down their political opposition. The only reason T__D is so popular is because of this censorship. The liberals that run this site don't like it and so have made special rules for this one subreddit. You should be upset about that unequal treatment and stop pretending it doesn't exist. [end]
[start] This is amazing. I hope this post sparks the change. I really think these are normal, everyday people you know that like to secretly go home and join this little group of like minded people. It's not weird, happens all the time. It's just annoying for r/all.  [end]
[start] If I could scroll past the noisy table at the restaurant, I wouldn't give a fuck.  [end]
[start] I just don't understand why block it from everyone? It seems like a CTR move, even post-election. If someone doesn't like a sub, it's very easy to block it. I have at least a hundred shit subs that I have filtered, the_donald being one of them. It should be up to the user to determine if they want certain content blocked. I can't even count the amount of porno subs that pops up on /r/all (I know I can filter all nsfw subs, but some are funny, not just porn), but we're worried about some garbage political sub.  [end]
[start] Why has no one complained about /r/enoughtrumpspam ? I dont really care for /r/the_donald , but all ETS does is moan and groan in my eyes.  [end]
[start] Personally I find ETS and Politics just as vitriolic and loud. I immediately filtered those out.  [end]
[start] A more apt analogy would be that that the manager came over, argued with the loud customers to no avail, then proceeded to mess with that tables orders as a "joke". [end]
[start] I also have a problem with being "forced" to look at a sub reddit I am not allowed to participate in, just because I pointed out that a bunch of the posts used British spelling and thus seemed like foreign trolling.  [end]
[start] This is spot on. I don't agree with Trump or TD at all, but I can stand to see supporting submissions for a candidate I don't like on /r/all. But the sub has slowly morphed into every submission being in full panic mode, there's more TD on /r/all, and its racism is way more prominent than it was even a year ago. It's why I finally decided to go out of my way to figure out how to filter them out using RES, right before the normal filtering feature was made available to all users.  Edit: Some examples of racism:  * https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4rcgbm/the_donald_is_a_hate_group_summary_of_the_first/?st=iw6u92n9&sh=a2c9aa8a * https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4rtn0x/i_hate_to_politicize_this_but_the_racism_on_the/?st=iw6u3mi9&sh=3c5ffdc0 * https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4rv0un/rthe_donald_claims_not_to_condone_racism_on_their/?st=iw6u0yqi&sh=bca0846f [end]
[start] reddit is privately-owned, so the administrators' actions are protected free speech.    /r/The_Donald's efforts to use this site as an alt-right propaganda platform are not protected free speech.  [end]
[start] what happened to r/sweden? i thoroughly enjoyed their [beat down](https://i.redditmedia.com/z4IJ28OWBtSbFJ1tEqU6YzBh437GkLcxGr2MJ1s7QGY.jpg?w=479&s=0a2ac0c919a318d136d241177f616d52) of T_D a while back.   [end]
[start] Oh come on no one gave a fuck when Bernie was 24/7 covering the front page during primaries and as soon as it was trump the website gets its shit changed to keep them off. Seeing 2 or 3 td posts in /all isn't the equivalent to being a bull in a China shop. [end]
[start] This is all just high level fake content.  This post is literally an "ad." If I hated Donald Trump and the_donald, I would hold the same position on censorship.  I don't like Reddit mods censoring content; I want reddit to be an open, decentralized forum.  [end]
[start] I wish all politics would just be banned from r/all [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Nah, banning The_Donald is still a good idea, just like banning FPH and coontown. [end]
[start] r/T_D Is just another circlejerk Subreddit, if r/circlejerk made it to the front page I would block it also. It's not about Donald Trump, it's about not wanting to see 7/25 of the front page being all capitols and something like "HILLARY IS CONFIRMED A WOMAN, NO WOMAN HAS EVER HELD THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE. H A I L T R U M P ." [end]
[start] Thank God for the filter [end]
[start] It's absolutely hilarious how angry they are. I posted one comment pointing out this same hypocrisy and I got banned. I then "apologized" to the moderator for triggering them and I got muted haha.  [end]
[start] I want r/politics banned for the same reason you just listed. Why would it not be a bad idea using your logic? Why shouldn't they? [end]
[start] Personally I just want organic post ranking. I want to see occasional r/the_donald posts, and occasional r/enoughtrumpspam posts. A few. Once in a while. When they're high quality enough to reach the front of r/all without manipulation. [end]
[start] Why weren't these kind of posts being made when s4p was filling r/all?  Oh because the liberal circlejerk liked that. You just don't like seeing t_d because they hold views counter to yours. That's like me saying "well I don't like seeing video games on r/all, it really is just annoying so can you keep your shit off the front page r/gaming" why should shit be kept off the front page if it's being upvoted?  It's absurd.    And especially now that filtering subs from r/all is native to reddit, you have no excuse for looking at subs you don't like. If you're doing that then it's your own fault really. Why censor t_d when every user could just block it if they wanted to? [end]
[start] In reality, there are several loud and obnoxious groups in the restaurant (/r/politics, for instance), but because **this** particular group is being loud and obnoxious, suddenly it's inappropriate and needs to be stopped immediately.  So now the restaurant manager has threatened this particular group for their rowdiness. Meanwhile, the rest of the restaurant continues with its own loud, obnoxious behavior, several tables even going so far as to shout insults towards the group that was previously silenced.  That's not even getting into the edited posts part of it, which would be like trying to intentionally serve this particular table raw chicken, and then blaming their rowdiness for your decision to try and do so. [end]
[TITLE] Why /r/The_Donald is making reddit worse, and why it needs to go. [TITLE]
[start] Criticism of the right?  Get upvoted on r/politics  Criticism of the left?  Why, that's hate speech [end]
[start] /r/news was never the best but over the last year it's become toxic at completely new levels. [end]
[start] Everyone is forgetting that TD came to prominence when the powermods went on a censorship binge when Omar Mateen murdered 50 people in a gay nightclub. The news mods tried to remove all mention of the guy pledging himself to the ISIS leader.   Maybe censorship  just drives people away from your subs and into new ones? How about if you do not censor and create a bunch of new subs dedicated to exactly what you have tried to suppress?  [end]
[start] Considering the fact that r/politics, or many other subs, or the whole front page, are filled with anti-Trump propaganda, I am thankful that T_D is the only place where I can read things from the other perspective. To be fair, if r/politics wasn't in full shill mode, T_D wouldn't have been so aggressive.  r/politics has been filled with CTR and 100% anti-Trump for almost a year. Those are not baseless accusation. I'm not sure if you're trolling or are still in phase 1.  But please, keep calling T_D hateful, sexist, and racist. It's been working great! [end]
[start] Douche bag makes post to call out T_D people in the comments rip OP a new asshole.. I LOVE IT  [end]
[start] Even if TD was to be banned I cannot see what the admins could practically to do stop it being recreated. This isn't like other subreddits that have been banned. Are they going to make it a rule that you cannot make a subreddit relating to the President of the United States? That seems very unlikely.  I appreciate your message and no one should be harassed on threatened on Reddit. However it is hard for me to interpret much from those out of context screenshots you have provided. I don't doubt that some users of TD have acted in a way that they should not have, but then again I have been told that I am 'fucking scum and don't belong in my country' by Hillary Clinton supporters on this website. So just because Reddit overall leans to the left let's not pretend that unacceptable behaviour doesn't happen on both sides.  Like others I have also been banned from other subreddits where I have never even mentioned US politics merely because I have occasionally posted in TD. I think that is unacceptable too. You cannot expect users of subreddits like TD to act like 'everyone else on Reddit' when they are made outcasts from the get-go with actions like that.  What troubles me about what Spez didn't isn't the content, context or even subreddit where he made his edit. It is the fact that he edited a post on this website at all. It sets a terrible precedent. Frankly I would have been far more comfortable if he just deleted posts he didn't like. If, for example, staff on Facebook or Twitter were found to have taken an action like that it would be all over the news, and rightfully so. As of today [Reddit is the thirty-first most popular website on the internet](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/global;1). So it's not that different. I would even hazard to say that if someone more junior than the CEO of Reddit had done this they would have been removed from their job.  Finally you mention that /r/AltRight isn't 'as big of a deal'. That is only because TD exists. As I say in my first paragraph if TD is banned its users will just go elsewhere. Perhaps to the subreddit mentioned. Then will the admins ban all 'alt-right' subreddits? Then all right-wing subreddits? It's not practical. [end]
[start] You needed to stop right after "I'm all for free speech...".  I filter out T_D on my front page, but I've also given up on /politics as it is clearly just one-sided (not that it was ever very balanced).  And it was in the days after the election that the Sanders crowd in /politics was noting how quiet it was now that CTR shills were gone, so not much strength in your argument there.  I'm sorry you have received threatening messages, but I'd be very surprised if T_D mods were not being sent similar garbage. The extreme believers on both sides are highly toxic. [end]
[start] Oh yes, ban one of most vocal subreddits in the history of Reddit.  Yeah, nothing bad will come of banning popular things you simply don't agree with. Nothing at all. [end]
[start] > T_D used to be a quiet subreddit supporting Donald Trump.  Nope  > it has grown into a hateful, sexist, racist subreddit   Nope  Why should an entire sub be banned due to abusive PMs from a few users? There are like 300k people over there!   [end]
[start] [OP x-posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/5f0m3t/xpost_from_rself_why_rthe_donald_is_making_reddit/) to /r/enoughtrumpspam. [end]
[start] This may be the most tone deaf thing I've ever seen a mod post on Reddit, and I was a lurker for a long time. [end]
[start] Calling out T_D for "brigades" and being an "echochamber" is hilarious given the shit pile of an echochamber that /r/politics has been modded into. It says something when any /r/askreddit thread about "How to make my Reddit experience better" (or a similar question) always starts off with "Well, unsub from the defaults" or, more specifically, "unsub from /r/politics and /r/games." And given that SRD and SRS have been allowed to exist despite a history of repeated and unapologetic brigades, I don't see how T_D is doing anything untoward. And that's accepting your assertions that are given without *any* real evidence to back up your claim except for "I'm a default mod." Maybe you're angry that someone is playing your game and beating your shit at it?   And that's coming from a Sanders supporter that voted more NeverTrump than I did for Clinton. I definitely find nothing fun about having T_D on my /r/all every hour of the day. But your arguments against T_D are hilariously misguided at best, and purposefully blind at worst. [end]
[start] What's making this website worse is the terrible content filtering, naming you r/politics and r/news.  You are the ones who need to be removed and breed hate and lies with your biased reporting.   Take your own advice. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] >During the leaks, different default mods were mentioned in T_D by users calling them horrible things (like this). Did the T_D mods care? Nope. They left those comments (and many more like them) up. For example, look here.  Yeah, that didn't happen to the other side at all! There definitely wasn't a power mod who told people from T_D to shoot themselves which had to be removed by an *admin*, and [this thread](http://i.imgur.com/D9l3AFA.png) definitely doesn't exist and isn't still up. [end]
[start] OP is just getting lit up in this comments section, this is hilarious  [end]
[start] Y'all need to get outside more often. There's more to life than subreddits.  [end]
[start] More handwringing? Good God - give it a rest, Reddit. Do you want to go the way of Digg? Just be a neutral forum and shut up...mods/admins should appear in times of actual crisis, not bizarre imagined problems.   If your complaint includes any "ist" thing, then you really ought to just label yourself a safe space. Voat isn't a viable competitor right now - but there will be one. These draconian, top-down rules are going to create a new competitor. This is exactly why Trump won the election - a bunch of elites sat around calling the common people Nazis, bigots and racists.   Be the Miltonian marketplace of ideas you ought to be - illegal content should be banned. Gaming the system...that's really an admin problem, isn't it? Pointing out glaring abuses of the system? That's totally within bounds.   I love Reddit, I do - because it used to have a hands-off policy. Now that we've seen the shit and spunk you've dredged yourself in, you've lost all credibility. Why not enforce a centrist view on /r/politics instead of bitching about the active communities? A grocery store would quickly go out of business if they closed the deli to cater to vegans and pretended tofurkey was the real thing.   I called it a while back - this election ended Reddit because it couldn't keep its nose clean.   From a guy begging to be sent Bernie Sanders, no less. Please keep Reddit an open marketplace. Stop bitching so much, and just post quality content. Reddit would fare so much better with less rules, less whining, and more OC of ALL KINDS. Miltonian marketplace of ideas, man. Stop complaining about what other people are saying, and SPEAK FOR YOURSELF. That should really be the motto of this place.  [end]
[start] If you really pretend that /r/politics was not totally managed or undermined by CTR then you are delusional. [end]
[start] Most of the examples you showed of harassment are just people getting made fun of. It's hardly harassment. It sounds more like, to me, you don't like their stuff being up voted to the moon and back so it shows up on r/all    You're username doesn't really help your case either.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] nice try /u/spez [end]
[start] This post is just testing the waters for an eventual ban of T_D. Gauging public support in order to prepare for the inevitable backlash.  The usual concerns (air quotes implied) trodded up to justify political censorship. [end]
[start] Reddit is compromised.  There should be 0 censorship concerning politics.  I used to come to Reddit for news, but those days are long gone. [end]
[start] > I am a default mod, posting under an alt, because sadly that's what reddit has become  Yeah, it's bullshit, too, because if you really cared you'd post under your "real" user name so we could know what you mod because if you mod at r/politics then you are part of the problem and not part of any solution that I can see. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] To be perfectly fair, threats to anyone, mods included, should be reported to mods, if public, and admins if PMed. That is not acceptable from anyone.   That said, r/The_Donald has been threatened with removal for even MENTIONING r/politics. Then, the CEO of the site manually edited the database to change posts. This is outright censorship. To justify this behavior with "oh, I got called names without proof" is nonsense. This is like saying CNN would be right to falsify statements by Angela Merkel if she ever said the station broadcasting paid-for content and not news.  Let's be reasonable here, Reddit hosted r/jailbait for a long time. This was literally a subreddit dedicated to, and specifically for child pornography. This lasted around two years. There are current pro-pedophilia subreddits (not even interested in finding the names again, please dont make me). How is it that all this is okay, but the backlash from removing an ANTI-PEDOPHILIA subreddit, the posts mostly calling out this hypocrisy, warranted direct editing of people's posts? Can we even see a log of why r/pizzagate got banned, and one that wasn't manipulated by u/spez?  You see, even if you hate the message of T_D and pizzagate, your supreme leader and his team of censors directly manipulate the facts, and this is disgusting abuse of trust. I wish the TOS for Reddit outright said "you are here to only make posts confirming and conforming to the admins/mods beliefs, and all other opinions will be shunned and censored. I am sorry you guys have to swallow your pride and put up with us for at least four years, but if you don't like free speech and dissenting political opinions, go run this website in China. Maybe they'll let you execute some dissenters.  It is a sad, sad state of affairs when r/news should really be named r/democratpropaganda, and r/politics should really be named r/DNC. R/the_donald is a good source of actual news. If it makes a difference, I am banned from r/the_donald, and probably because of nonsense promulgated by the admins and the mods' influence on them. I still value the opinions there, and come to Reddit every day only because of that subreddit. I wander elsewhere to post, but I come here for T_D. [end]
[start] You love free speech but want to ban a sub cause you don't like its content-that isn't breaking site rules. That is bullshit. Why dont you start with the news subs censoring articles for their propaganda. [end]
[start] I do not post much as I am mostly a lurker.  I am not subscribed to the T_D site, but I do lurk quite of bit.  I read your post, and I could not have been more disappointed about your lack of evidence.  I viewed all the links that you provided, and they are pretty painless.  If you are truly disturbed by the "threats" that you are getting, please take the time to answer three questions:  1. Why did you miss the opportunity to provide actual evidence of the "threats" not just snapchats of incomplete conversations? 2. Why are you continuing to be a mod if you are so distraught with the environment in which you are? 3. How can you prove that the threats and dead animals being sent to the mods are coming from the T_D sub?  I am honestly curious about your answers to these questions. [end]
[start] r/politics remains a cesspool because they can't get over the fact that she won the popular vote. Too fucking bad, both her and Trump knew the rules coming in. How come no one had any problem with the Electoral College when they thought she was going to win in a landslide?  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Anyone else remember how every post on /r/politics was pro hillary right up until she lost and all of a sudden it was all done? Like posts that said otherwise were suppressed, even if they weren't about the election? [end]
[start] Honestly, all your examples aren't even threats. Also, why do you think mod criticism should be banned? They think you're shit, so they call you out. Just because it happens to you does not mean it should be banned. It probably happens to their mods and users at a much more extreme rate considering there is paid trolls attacking them. From your post all it seems is that you are actually just mad that you got called bad names and you want that to stop, but maybe T_D enjoys talking like that. I know this is a private website, but you shouldnt start behaving like an oligarchy and stuffing out any dissent - free speech is a wonderful thing and is the reason you have power in the first place. [end]
[start] This mod should be removed along with all the rest. [end]
[start] You're pathetic. If you can't handle the heat then get out of the way for someone who can. [end]
[start] TD is a reaction, a result of, the totalitarian policies in big subs like worldnews, politics, news, Europe, etc. They themselves created the extremes and the frustration by censoring any unwanted, then nuanced, opinions. This is actually reflected in actual politics across the West.  This entire OP proves nothing is learned. Therefor TD will continue to exist and grow.  [end]
[start] So you want The Donald banned because people were threatening other people? You called them a bunch of names with no evidence at all in your post. Anyone can make a threat to anyone and say they support someone, it's what happens all the time. It can be used to censor or ban anything and this thought process is dangerous for free speech  [end]
[start] Why don't you just ban people sending death threats? No need to ban a whole subreddit. [end]
[start] the last few months isnt really accurate, they have dominated the front page for..half a year?  more?  anyway, everything's fair game under the original set of rules.  that's how I like my games played.  if they make it to the front then they make it to the front. [end]
[start] So someone could false flag and get a whole r/ banned and you'd be ok with this?  [end]
[start] Face it, you fucked up. Spez fucked up. The admins fucked up. Own it and learn from the experience. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] > when a few comments were changed by /u/spez [+9] because you guys were calling him a pedophile (with no evidence) you guys flipped out and acted like it was the next Watergate.   The implication of what he has done goes further than hurt feelings.  T_D wasn't the only one to flip. r/technology and r/KotakuInAction reached the front page too. [end]
[start] You're not for free speech.  You don't even think people with opposing political views should have their own place to talk. [end]
[start] You say you are all for free speech.. What you actually mean is you're all for free speech you agree with. The chat logs say as much.. You're a hypocrite. Now you're crying because you got caught. And you're being put in your place. Now act like an adult and deal with it.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I'm neutral when it comes to politics and I agree T_D is over the top and crosses many boundaries, but why doesn't anyone address how /r/politics was a default sub that doesn't allow any conservative opinions? Does that sound fair to you? This is partly why T_D was so aggressive from it's beginnings, by censoring them for so long. I think we should've had half conservative mods and half liberal mods on /r/politics. These mods and reddit admins are partially responsible for creating the monster known as The_Donald.  edit: For those saying Politics doesn't ban as many people, first I would say Politics SHOULD have a higher standard than T_D, a subreddit that is a shitpost heaven(or hell) designed to be full of memes and is dedicated to one entity rather than the entire political world. Of course it is hypocritical for T_D to silence opposing opinions, no argument there. But for /r/politics, it seems so much worse to me for them to ban users or delete comments for suspicious reasons. [end]
[start] This thread has not gone like the OP wanted..  hahahah [end]
[start] If you have to dig deep into the comments to find any hate speech then ban those users, not the entire sub. The posts themselves are never hateful (at least the front page ones, I don't go to it myself). And if you are offended then stay away from it. It's really that simple.  [end]
[start] I understand why you dont like td, but td is donald supporters safe space if you will. You post anything pro trump outside of the subreddits. Doom downvoted rascist sexist etc. We cant post news in politics that favour trump because its gets downvoted.     Also i dont understand the spilling of td? We were redditors before td and jave been here for years..... [end]
[start] I am for free speech except for the speech I don't like. [end]
[start] One more thing to add:  I absolutely HATE how powermods, or super mods ban people who post in r/T_D. Thats  is so dumb. I only go to R/T_D for the memes because they are really funny at times. Why do i get auto banned from r/jokes for it? [end]
[start] No. The Donald doesnt need to go, all the big mods need to go. Your willingness to censor terrorist events because the perpetrator was islamic is DEEPLY troubling and you are NOT fit to mod anything what so ever.  Delete your accounts. [end]
[start] If only reddit had some system by which you could influence whether or not content you like shows up on the front page...  And no, I'm not referring to complaining to /u/spez... [end]
[start] I'm a bit curious about this part:  >However, over the past few months, it has grown into a hateful, sexist, racist subreddit that frequently reaches /r/all.  I see T_D on the front page all the time, but usually it is just them bragging about something or calling somebody out. I don't think I have ever seen any of that hateful/sexist/racist content at the top. I'm sure it exists somewhere in there, but not at the top. I agree that a lot of users over there are really bad, but that has to be a vocal minority, right? Banning the subreddit isn't going to solve anything except scattering these users to another sub where they will be even more vocal than before.  As I see it, the subreddit itself isn't the problem. It's a subset of users. Don't ban the community, ban the ones causing the problem.  EDIT: People telling me to go to the comments, it's the same story. The top comments are people shouting support for Trump and calling people (mostly members of 'the liberal media') out. Some of the lower comments may have that kind of content but they are NOT being pushed to the top. The hate/racism/sexism is there, yes, but it is not the entire community engaging in it. That is my point. The people over at T_D may all be loud shitposters, but do not call them ALL racists/sexists/bigots.  EDIT2: Of course my top comment of all time is now a pro-/r/The_Donald post. You made me do this, reddit. [end]
[start] This has NOTHING to do with you feeling insulted. The insults flew both ways this election cycle and we all know that.  Even people who don't like Trump are on this thread speaking out against this bullshit and for that I'm very proud of them.  This is you wanting to ban hundreds of thousands of people for political reasons.     [end]
[start] Hey. r/The_Donald mod here.  I located the original modmail and OP is leaving out a lot.   Immediately after this user messaged our modmail, the first reply was from a newer r/The_Donald mod. It said,   >"Imagine that. You contact us about someone harassing you and we react by banning them. Now, can you stop plotting to destroy our subreddit because you disagree with us?"  So immediately we banned the person in the screenshot provided.  Some other mods replied (I think OP already included these responses in the screenshot) then ...   A senior mod later replied,  >"Let's start this over. I'm just now seeing your message, (OP user name removed). Please give me a moment to read through your screen shot. The rest of this conversation will be between you and me."   and another senior mod replied as well,   >"(OP user name removed),  >I truly am sorry that you are going through something so terrible. Believe me when I say that we, as a team, absolutely do no tolerate such harassment. We are on the receiving end of more than enough of it to know that even if it is just words from a lonely, sad individual - it can still cause a lot of stress. Because we have zero tolerance for this, we banned the user in question.  >Despite what you seem to believe - we make it a point to remove any content directly naming anyone who is not a public figure. Do we get all of it? No, and I think you can understand that capturing all of that is an impossible task. We do our best, and we do truly want to keep the peace and make sure there are no agitators (from either side) attacking people. As of this time, the only suggestion seeming to come from "the other side of the aisle," is that our sub gets shut down. We aren't going anywhere, so if you are willing to present us with some requests or feedback on how we can make this a happier situation for everyone, we are always open to speaking with you respectfully.  >This message is from both myself and (other senior the_donald mod - name removed) so if you would like to talk about this respectfully and help us figure out what it is we can do to show we are taking steps, please send either of us a PM. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy your Thanksgiving! :)"  I can provide screenshots of the entire exchange with names removed if needed and admins can verify that what I am saying is true.    EDIT: Screenshots by request   [1](https://i.sli.mg/ZICGX6.png)  [2](https://i.sli.mg/wfayYD.png)  [3](https://i.sli.mg/zisYTZ.png) [end]
[start] CTR brigading /r/politics was not a baseless accusation; it's a well-documented fact that they bragged about themselves. The fact that we knew it was happening on a macro level but had no way to filter it on a micro level was a furious problem that was 100% caused by them. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] you can not just ban subs you dont like... dont like pc gamers ? say goodbye to PCmasterrace ? dont like call of duty say good bye to r/cod or what ever their sub is  [end]
[start] Look, this is really simple.  Every website you go to is voluntary; in case of confusion, that means you freely chose to visit said website.  This includes Reddit.  Yes, you have the ability to choose the subs you want to follow, and if I recall correctly, your 'Front' page only pulls from your subs...  which means to complain about r/all being full of things you dont want to see means you chose to visit r/all.    What is important here is acknowledgement of your responsibility in coming to reddit and risking being exposed to things you may find offense (The_Donald, in this case).  No one forced you to come here, you chose to.  If you cant handle what you are exposed to, leave.  Or, stay in your 'safe place' on your own personal front page.  I'm mentally exhausted by the number of people who feel censorship is the solution to their poor choices.    Sack up or saunter on, please. [end]
[start] r/politics is much more cancerous IMO  And I say this as someone banned from TD.  Banning a subreddit is a really bad idea, there are tons of cancerous subs that post weird and controversial things.  You can moderate and ban users who brigade or send death threats but shutting down a subreddit is just insanity. Like smashing open a bee hive cause you don't like the bees. [end]
[start] You talk about hate speech but provide no examples.  The weak shit you provided is so minor compared to what a T_D user would experience in one of the hate filled default subs.  Get your head out of your ass and look around, you are the problem, not T_D.  You should be thanking them because it's the only place on this site where you can have an actual discussion often provided with sources rather than just be called some -ism/-ist and downvoted to oblivion.        [end]
[start] This wasn't even a legit argument for removing the subreddit. You didn't bother to acknowledge that CTR is real, nor did you bother to prove that it wasn't.. you just called it baseless. Yep.. I agree.. harassment is bad, and PEOPLE who harass PEOPLE should be kicked off the site. It's super fucking easy to block shit you don't want to see. I'm not entirely sure how this gets missed with all of the crying. I don't like enoughtrumpspam because they have absolutely zero self awareness and seem to ignore they are a big addition of trump spam. Do I complain to get them removed? No.. I just filter them out of my life. It's not rocket surgery. [end]
[start] You really need to go outside. This post is so self important it's hilarious- no literally, I laughed throughout.  Stop trying to censor speech you disagree with. [end]
[start] "I like free speech so long as everyone only says what I like to hear" [end]
[start] TL;DR you're upset that Reddit is no longer a partisan liberal bastion. [end]
[start] You might not be an /r/politics mod. However, looking at your post history, you seem to be a left leaning individual.   *But* you're against Bernie Sanders. You have posted in /r/Enough_Sanders_Spam.   So in conclusion, you're a Hillary supporter.   Your candidate lost, get over it. Don't drag other subreddits down with you. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Everyone hates the mods and the admins *way* more than they hate the_donald.  I can block the_donald, I can't block asshole mods than ban people for political disagreements or other personal issues.  I can't block Rnews mods who delete all postings showing Islam in a negative light.  I can't block admins changing the algorithm because of their political antagonism to the_donald. [end]
[start] "Shouts of "CTR HAS INFILTRATED THE MOD TEAM" have been going around since the early days of the election. However, it's gotten way worse then baseless accusations" -except in the leaked Slack chats a mod claimed to miss his CTR checks.  The issue that he changed comments is significantly greater than feelings being hurt. He changed a legal document. He potentially altered the outcome of an investigation into Brian Pagliano's management of HRC's email deletions.   He broke reddit Terms of Service. When someone that is charged with ultimately enforcing the rules can violate the rules at will and without any consequences, the integrity of the entire system is called into question.   I think that moderators clear discrimination against a particular sub via altering the algorithm to mange what makes it to r/all is making the website worse for moderators. Far be it from me to make my voice the voice of all other users, but i know 300K+ that want to see T_D around.   [end]
[start] I hate T_D. Never posted there, never intend to. But I've been on reddit long enough to know why T_D exists.  You're to blame. It is your fault that T_D exists.  You, the default mod team, and to an extent the admins, have created an environment rife for speculation about pushing a narrative and censoring another one.  > /r/politics this election has been very controversial. Shouts of "CTR HAS INFILTRATED THE MOD TEAM" have been going around since the early days of the election. However, it's gotten way worse then baseless accusations.  The accusations got worse because automod was removing comments that mentioned it. If you don't understand how that fuels the speculation, you have no business being a mod.  The behavior of reddit admins and the default power mods has pushed people to the fringes and concentrated their speech. By concentrating it you've made it louder. You are witnessing the result of your own policies.  Instead of typing up all of this again, here is a comment I typed up in reply to /u/spez admitting to editing comments that I didn't post simply because I didn't want to have a post history in T_D.  ----  Hey /u/spez. I'm sure you'll never see this because of the flood of mentions and replies you're getting, and I'm sure even if you did you wouldn't care, but I'm here from /r/all (as usual) and this is the most contextually relevant place to post it right now.  This is my first, and god fucking willing my last, participation on /r/The_Donald. I hate this subreddit. I hate everything about it. I hate the CSS. I hate the titles and the comments that look like FWD from grandma shit in all caps. I hate the users. I hate the pathetic attempts at recreating the heyday of memes. Everything about this subreddit is cancer. Congratulations, because you and the mods of the defaults created this shitshow. It's your fault these trolls exist to begin with. I blame you, the admins, and the mods of the defaults over any of the shitty users here.  Do you know what I would see on my front page, not being a subscriber to *any* partisan subreddits, during the election? Hillary Clinton defense. Donald Trump bashing. I'm not a fan of either of those people and as someone who was disillusioned by this election, I wanted a fair shake at information. Reddit failed at that, and it was active. I saw posts removed from /r/politics that were topical to the election both anti-Hillary and pro-Trump. I saw threads locked. I saw comment graveyards that could easily be read using archives which proved that the comments were benign support of the candidate reddit didn't like. So when I was looking for election news aggregation where was I to go? Not /r/politics or any other topical subreddit that should, in theory, be non-partisan as a generic news subreddit. Definitely not any of the defaults. No, I went to /r/all because the only posts that weren't extremely one-sided Salon blogs against Trump or for Hillary were in this shitshow of a subreddit or one of its sister subreddits. Even when they were completely legitimate fact-based journalism about an ongoing FBI investigation.  Most of that can be scapegoated to the mods. That's what reddit admins do best. Shrug shoulders and say the mods get to do what they want. Except this is not strike one for you against this subreddit. This is strike two. You actively edited comments on this subreddit which is a fucking despicable abuse of power but a few weeks back there was another thing that as an IT guy who works a lot in web based stuff made me raise a serious eyebrow.  A few weeks ago the front 25 pages or so of /r/all were completely filled with posts from this subreddit. A lot of people were just marginally frustrated or amused by it. I was concerned because it was very blatant evidence of you fucking with the algorithm specifically targeting a subreddit. The excuse by another admin whose name escapes me at the moment was a change to a cache database done in production unrelated to this subreddit specifically which is, to me, fairly blatant bullshit. I thought you were fucking with the weight of the posts on this subreddit for the front page but I had no real concrete evidence so I didn't talk about it much except in one private subreddit. Sounds like someone put a decimal in the wrong place or accidentallied a zero.  You actually editing comments here maliciously as the CEO of a company that's had double-digit millions of venture capital funding under the ownership of a mass media conglomerate really throws your benefit of the doubt out the windows, does it not?  There's something to be said about all the reasons people claim Donald Trump is now the president-elect of the US. I can't say I completely disagree with any of them. One of those is that the active campaign to promote Hillary Clinton in the media backfired because people were fed up with it. Whether Trump is a fraud, con artist, or real champion of the people is beside the point. Gaze upon your microcosm of that, /u/spez. Reddit is a small scale experiment that demonstrates that exact phenomenon. You and your ablative armor of moderators actively suppress news based on a political bias and /r/The_Donald is the pendulum swinging in the opposite direction. You control the arm of that pendulum. If you were doing it right nobody would have noticed and you could just say it was the userbase and their majority opinion. Instead you got greedy and your bias and collusion with the moderators was exposed.  The fact that reddit is biased at the core of the organization and actively manipulating conent is no longer just some conspiracy theory that's run about in every political thread. You've come out and given legitimacy to every politically conservative conspiracy theory about reddit tampering with the narrative.  You are the reason this subreddit exists and is constantly on the top of /r/all where I have to see it. You've created an environment where the only way I can get a perspective from both sides is to look at the obviously biased subreddits with non-partisan names and descriptions along side obviously biased subreddits with partisan names and descriptions. How do you feel about that?  ----  Maybe you, as a defauly mod, should be focusing on the fact that you were part of the leaked chat to behind with instead of the fact that it was leaked and people are angry about it? [end]
[start] I love how mods censor news and views they don't agree with and then whine because people get riled up and all hell breaks loose.  How about we stop censoring the damn internet! Then you probably won't get threats and the like.   Mods: *I'm going to play god and piss people off, but they better not say anything about it.*  You reap what you sow ladies. [end]
[start] You lost me when you claimed hate speech is not free speech.  Of course it is - it's just speech that you hate. [end]
[start] Harassment spilling over to other subs, and to users in their life outside of reddit, is completely unacceptable and shouldn't be tolerated.      Edit: So after a lovely barrage of hateful comments and messages I would like to clarify that I literally give zero fucks about politics. Apparently it's completely incomprehensible that I don't have some kind of hidden agenda. The reality is this: I stand by what I said. Harassment, doxxing, etc. shouldn't be tolerated by *any* user or sub end of story. If you have proof of a user or sub doing so, you can always submit it to the admins for review and by all means please do! [end]
[start] Mind linking to specific instances of this "hateful, sexist, racist" content you supposedly see all the time? It shouldn't be too hard considering you say it frequently hits the front page.  We're waiting. It'd be a shame if you lied in order to push your own agenda. [end]
[start] Only in power mod fantasy world is saying mean things to people worse than *the CEO of this website editing the words of users he disagrees with*. Spez is an unethical compete piece of shit that should be fired. T_D should be praised for exposing his unethical behavior, not banned. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Lol bitching about /r/The_Donald while defending /r/politics. At least The_D doesn't hide their agenda. [end]
[start] Piss off. It's sad when the default subs are so heavily moderated that people HAVE to rely on T_D for halfway accurate news. This place is going down the shithole and I'm actively looking for a new place to waste time. [end]
[start] R/politics insane bias isn't good for Reddit either. At least the Donald is honest about their bias.  Edit: Can someone explain to me why mods always lock threads? I feel like when it's not going perfectly their way they lock. So what if people comment shit you don't like? [end]
[start] >Shouts of "CTR HAS INFILTRATED THE MOD TEAM" have been going around since the early days of the election. However, it's gotten way worse then baseless accusations.  >/r/politics mods have been sent death threats, gifs of dead animals, and have been the targets of brigades that originate on T_D. And the T_D mods don't really care.   I think it would be difficult for any reasonable person to go to /r/politics now, vs. a year ago, and say that there is not some very serious and heavy brigading going on that no one is doing anything about. If you are critical of Hillary, and you don't need to be a Trump fan to be critical of that woman, your comment will be vote-humped for *days*. I have comments sitting at controversial and -1/+2 that have [stayed that way for over a week](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5e3wte/dear_hardworking_white_people_congratulations_you/da9jsaa/). And I'm supposed to believe that's normal? It never used to be that way. It doesn't make sense from a normal user perspective at all.   It stifles free discussion, because the downvoting is so consistent and savage that a newer user will be very quickly silenced, and it makes many people hesitate to contribute with their true thoughts and opinions.   The only way to use /r/politics in a normal way right now is to sort it by controversial. I don't know if /r/news is as bad, but it's definitely also full of some hyper-interested and single-minded, parroting bunch of people who all say the exact same things, all vote the exact same way on the same posts, and all love the DNC and Hillary and try to make Trump out to be Lord Doom. *It's all the same thing*. It's infuriating.  Sort it by /controversial and look at the kind of posts that get brigaded. And we're supposed to believe regular users are doing that? [Look](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/controversial/).   Some of those posts make sense to be at the top of controversial sort, like 'Whites against Trump' and 'safe spaces for white people' (and those are at the top-top, which makes good sense). But Wikileaks releases, criticisms of the Russian blame game, criticisms of the Fake News campaign, and most certainly of the Clinton narrative are all being hammered. And those are normal users? (Controversial sort also works in comment threads of course, and is equally revealing in most cases.)  Get rid of the bots, CTR, whoever they are with the Trump scaremongering and the fake news propagandizing and the vote humping and every other miserable thing they've done to those subs. Make it usable again and maybe people like me won't get so royally pissed off trying to use it normally that they 'call people horrible things'.   I don't think you have the right to say who gets censored and who gets banned when your subs are in such disarray. You don't have to be on the_donald or whatever identity politics you guys are playing right now to be sick up to here with the nonsense going on in your subreddits. [end]
[start] still stinging from the election loss, some people on reddit see getting rid of r/The_Donald as one of the few ways they can get back at those gloating over Trump's success. poor things [end]
[start] Yeeeaaahhhhh...... R/the_donald better not fucking be removed.  [end]
[start] Lol, backfired a bit, didn't it? [end]
[start] Who cares.  It shows up on the front page like twice a day.  Grow up and deal with it differing opinions than yours. [end]
[start] When have they posted racist things?  [end]
[start] Ban /r/pedofriends first and foremost.  [end]
[start] Maybe people go a little hard when they've been called hateful, sexist, and racist for as long as they have been. It's funny that nobody got this upset against r/S4P when it ruled r/all every day. If you honestly think the posts that are high up are racist and sexist you aren't looking at them. I can't say anything for PMs. The only racist thing they post is a picture of hillary with a kkk member. [end]
[start] Anybody who uses the terms "racist" or "sexist" without any proof backing them up needs to be tarred and fucking feathered.  I'm so sick of you little boys who cry wolf.    [end]
[start] You can hate the subreddit all you want but blaming a group of people for the actions of very few with regards to death threats and harassment is bullshit. Its just as bad as them blaming liberals for violence in protests etc. Its not valid criticism. [end]
[start] You're full of crap. I held off on going into T_D for a long time because I was concerned about being harassed as a Jew.   What I found was a community that cheered on anyone, Jew, Muslim, Gay, Black, Hispanic, whatever, that was willing to take the red pill.   Claiming T_D is Racist, Sexist, Xenophobic is leftist name calling and quite frankly the world is growing sick of the Clinton technique.   Reddit is CTR and Pussycat pictures without T_D.   Taste the damned red pill if you can't actually swallow it, pretty snowflake.   The Internet doesn't have to set up a safe space for you.    [end]
[start] We get it /u/spez you don't like your bullshit being called out  [end]
[start] I never would have set foot in that shithole if all the major subs like /r/politics and /r/news hadn't been censoring literally every post about the wikileaks dumps. The state of those subs is a far more serious issue than T_D being crass on the front page.   > someone pointed out /r/Altright, which is an issue,   Your real motives are showing. [end]
[start] Obviously you don't understand what hate speech is. Let me help you out.  All X are fucking lazy.  All X are stupid as Fuck.  Anyone who is X is worthless.  X are all X.  Hate speech is an attack on a group or an individual in a group because of their group membership. Generally these groups have been defined as [race sex gender nationality sexual orientation or religion] but do not have to be, so long as the group being attacked is seen as a victim class.   The problem of course is that second part, where you have to be a victim class, as the definition of such membership is debatable. For example, saying all women are lazy is hate speech, while saying all white people are racist is not considered hate speech. The same is true, criticism of some religions is tolerable and not hate speech, while others are "off limits".  Someone calling you a cuck isn't hate speech, even if it is hateful.  So far your point has been that T_D users have sent you messages that you find hateful. I don't excuse the behavior, but if thats all it takes I find all of the posts on /r/socialism to be hateful. Ive been personally messaged by members of /r/hillaryclinton and /r/sandersforpresident telling me to kill myself, to get cancer, to die in a fire. Ive been called a racist, a bigot, ignorant, sexist, a member of the KKK, an Islamaphobe and various other insults. Yet I do not advocate for banning of their subs or members. I ignore them and move on with my life because I am an adult. You should try it. [end]
[start] /u/spez probably was the one to gold this 5 times and give this nonsense 6,000 upvotes [end]
[start] This really didn't turn out how you wanted huh buddy? Lmmfao  [end]
[start] I suspect those in r/The_Donald might disagree with your assessment, especially given your not-so-unbiased username. I'm no subscriber, I'm just saying everything has two sides.  [end]
[start] You know what's real neat?  Now that reddit admins have been proven to be editing the_donald users post, not a damn bit of proof you guys can point at to show that they do anything can be taken legitimately.   Isn't that a really neat cause and effect there? [end]
[start] Funny.   I keep hearing about this "hate" on TD. Where is it? The only time I've experienced hate on this site is being a conservative on /r/politics.  Stop acting like a victim in order to shut down opposing speech. [end]
[start] Hi, i dont much like r/athiesm or r/twoxchromosomes. I dont think it is fair that kim davis recieved death threats. Please ban them according to the argument that OP provided above.   Thanks!!! [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] >hateful, sexist, racist  Stopped reading there, this post is retarded [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Honestly, if Reddit could let us filter r/all, it would solve the issue for me.   I hate seeing their post fill the top post on r/all too. So much that I've even considered looking for a Reddit alternative.  [end]
[start] /r/politics is just as bad as The_Donald these days. It's just the opposite political extreme. [end]
[start] I stopped reading after you said you were all for free speech except that which you deem hate speech. That is exactly what the first amendment is there to protect otherwise you aren't at all for free speech. If an idiot feels the need to reveal themselves with hate speech let them do it and use your speech to make them look ridiculous.  [end]
[start] Someone's salty because their corrupt little candidate got BTFO by the American people [end]
[start] The donald doesn't contain hate speech.. Wtf are you even talking about!?   You've clearly never actually visited the sub or given it a fair chance. The community there are easily the most welcoming and thoughtful group on this site IMO. I've seen nothing but love for people of all races, religions and sexuality.  You don't stand for free speech and your ignorance (and many others ignorance) towards The_Donald just shows how unwilling you are to remove yourself from the circle-jerk of anti-trumpers   I've been banned from Enough trump spam and other just just for making a comment/post on The_donald. The admins of reddit have changed the way the site works to silence The_Donald or limit it's ability to reach /r/all and have continued to attempt to shut it down on false flag attempts. And now the CEO even comes in and edits the comments.. Just before your circle jerk chat gets leaked?   The only hate speech i see is from people like you.   You and many others are so intolerant to other peoples opinions if they do not align with your own and proceed to label them as racists or sexist or bigoted. That alone proves to all The_Donald users that you have no clue what you're talking about.     [end]
[start] The default sub mods deleted information about blood donations during the Orlando Shooting and the only way it made it to the front page was because of T_D.. Your mods deleted a major event off the front page because *my narrative*..  You sir, can fuck off. [end]
[start] Stop whining and delete it from your front page.  [end]
[start] u/PM-ME-BERNIE-SANDERS Do you see how ridiculous the community thinks your arguments are? Do you understand that constantly hurling false accusations of sexism and racism is hate speach as well? What is it going to take for you power tripping mods to wake up? [end]
[start] Sorry, Reddit burned it's one and only "We're all for free speech but..." card when you *The Reddit Mods* started Gamergate by deleting 2500 posts and banning hundreds of user accounts from /r/gaming to flex your neckbeard hipster superpowers to White Knight your friends from some trivial and embarrassing facts that probably would have blown over in week if you had stuck to your 'Free Speech' principles and left it the fuck alone.   Live by the Streisand Effect, Die by The Streisand Effect.  I have no pity for you now.  You made the The_Donald Frankenstein, it's a horrible hate fueled monster and I hope it chokes the life out of the whole lot of you and burns this place to the ground.     [end]
[start] What did your post look like before spez changed it?  [end]
[start] Yeah let's ignore an entire group of people's views and call it every kind of -ist or -ism you can think of to try to devalue them. Let's pretend people don't have these opinions and they don't need to be discussed and evaluated to see whether they deserve some weight.  That's worked so well in the past, *cough* brexit, *cough* 2016 election *cough*. [end]
[start] @OP I must begin by saying I'm pretty impassioned against your position.  That said, please read anything I write below in a voice of respect because I write this out of a genuine sense of respect.  I disagree with this post and hope to craft an argument against OP.  With all due respect I must say *Boo*.  I have to boo this request for censorship because it's based on claims which are not true and do not show how T_D specifically has encouraged behavior from users that are out of the norm.  > Before I begin, let me be clear - I am all for free speech. ... However, free speech does not mean hate speech is okay  This is touchy logic because you haven't laid out what the demarcation qualifiers are for "hate speech" and what constitutes "free speech."  By not laying out the qualifiers you are suggesting a system that can be abused.  The risk is that people label the speech they agree with as "free speech" and the speech they disagree with as "hate speech," which is exactly what you see done on alternative sites like Tumblr.  On the internet that I've grown up with I've noticed a big law: people **love** their echo chambers.  Don't make reddit yet another echo chamber.  The idea is free exchange of *ideas* not free exchange of *idea*.  > ...over the past few months, it has grown into a hateful, sexist, racist subreddit that frequently reaches /r/all > reddit rules state that hate speech is not okay.  I'm not going to let this claim go.  I don't believe it's true that T_D engages in hate speech from what I've seen by lurking T_D and reddit in general.  You need to prove this is the case; you need to prove this is indeed true.  I hope you can acknowledge that there exists a legitimate free speech ideas that some groups may label "hateful, sexist, racist" that other groups see as legitimate facts to encourage policy debates.  For example, talking about terrorism can be seen by some as implicitly racist whereas others may see it as a fact of reality that must be confronted.  Of the evidence I hope you uncover to support *this* claim that you then realize most if not all evidence fall under this category of divisive ideas.  Again, free exchange of *ideas* not *idea*.  This is a cornerstone of your post, and by rejecting the truth-value of this claim the rest of your post appears to fall flat.  To use your words, this claim appears to be baseless.  > During the leaks, different default mods were mentioned in T_D by users calling them horrible things (like this). Did the T_D mods care? Nope. > might say that I'm a special little snowflake and that I need to get off reddit because this is all it took for my fee fees to get hurt. Consider this - other DM's have been sent horrendous stuff for the past year, and you guys didn't care  Moderators are public figures in the internet world.  Moderators are figures for criticism, because they change the experience of users on the site.  When facts (or, granted, rumors) are brought to light users therefore have a reaction that is extreme because moderators are powerful whereas users are not.  Letting users vent their frustrations is therapeutic for users and is an outlet.  I see nothing wrong with T_D moderators not deleting posts because they are derogatory towards these internet public figures.  > T_D members even go so far as to attack the /r/politics mod in question over at /r/RandomActsOfChristmas (see here and here)  Please prove these are indeed T_D members because I believe you're rolling up a group of mean spirited jerks into the group of T_D members.  These mean spirited jerks are indeed bad for reddit because they don't want to engage in honest discourse but as a libertarian I get queasy when there are talks of removing posts and banning users.  Trolls have existed as long as the internet has been a thing.  > Did the T_D mods care? Nope. > On any other subreddit, the comments would be removed and the people behind them would be banned. Not on T_D, where the mods don't really care about any of it **(it referencing DMs and mean spirited posts)**.  Of the people who are both T_D members and mean spirited jerks, what do you expect the T_D mods to do?  Assuming they behave on T_D subreddit there is no grounds for mods of one subreddit (T_D) to take action against users who do bad in another subreddit.  That seems to be the governing practice engaged in by all subreddit mods.  Please explain why I'm wrong, and what kind of policing you'd like to see of T_D mods?  *In conclusion*  I think your post represents a scary line of thought.  In it you make a character attack against T_D mods and denizens of the subreddit with very little proof.  The maneuvering you're doing appears to be to label speech you don't personally agree with as "hate speech" without a legitimate test of what "hate speech" is.  This very clearly encourages censorship and is anti-reddit.  The *best* thing about reddit is this place has a community interested in the free exchange of ideas instead of being an echo chamber for one idea.  Users are exposed to many lines of thought they otherwise would not.  But by labeling speech you don't agree with as "hate speech" you remove the validity of their ideas.  Instead of engaging in policy debate and letting the marketplace correct itself (which is does with extreme fervor) you advocate censorship.  With all due respect, I hope you reconsider your opinion. [end]
[start] Many liberals seem to have the impression that r/the_donald is a small group of white nationalists using auto-vote bots to spread their racist xenophobic sexist islamaphobic hate speech.  Is it possible that the subreddit is instead a massive collection of young, right-leaning Americans to gather on one board? Is it possible that a large number of people has different opinions than you? [end]
[start] Actually, you know what's making Reddit worse?    Shills. Shills like the OP of this thread are making Reddit worse. [end]
[start] "I am all for free speech" ????? Yet you want to ban a subreddit dedicated to a specific part of the political spectrum? Are you forgetting about how Bernie was plastered absolutely everywhere across reddit yet for some reason because you agree with it it's okay? The double standards are real here. [end]
[start] All good things come to an end.  It is Reddit's time. [end]
[start] Your Slackchat shows you guys to be no better than what you're criticizing.   I've got no interest in the words if a hypocrite.  [end]
[start] Remember when /r/Sandersforpresident would fill /r/all and brigade subs they didn't like, and still certain people wouldn't say a thing?  This thread is what facism is all about. [end]
[start] > However, over the past few months, it has grown into a hateful, sexist, racist subreddit that frequently reaches /r/all.   Stopped reading there.  Please provide for each claim proof (direct quotations, without u/spez having edited them beforehand).  Thank you. [end]
[start] Lmao holy shit OP, you're the problem with Reddit. [end]
[start] Using a politically charged name in an attempt to make a "non political for the better of everyone" argument while claiming to support free speech... This is some LeafyIsHere logic. Also, broad statements like "On any other subreddit, the comments would be removed and the people behind them would be banned." This doesn't exactly show an objective point of view, and is clearly the response of someone taking things personally from a position of power- something ironically Donald is critisized of frequently.   Saying "T_D" members attacked others on other subreddits isn't valid, that's the same as saying "members of America" and claiming this is a reason to ban all Americans. It's not a valid point at all. Posting deleted comments of mods being "attacked" shows a general misunderstanding of what being in a position of power entails- using the words of people framed for your argument whilst they are not allowed to speak (assumedly, as you say these types of comments earn bans).  Your argument simply shows that you classify groups of people based on a few outliers you don't like. This places you with racists, sexist- everything Donald is being critisized of. You don't deserve to be in a position of power in a realm of free speech. I don't even like Donald being president, but you are simply trying to stifle free speech to get your way. [end]
[start] So your mad they attacked r politics? That whole sub is a shit show undersevering of default status. Shill city. Yall are so divided by this 2 party system that the have you distracted just the way they like. Smdh [end]
[start] As someone banned from T_D, this is the stupidest fucking post I've ever read. "They don't believe what I believe, BAN THEM!!! I made up a couple anecdotes to support me, ban them now." If it's so fucking hard being a mod, stop being a mod then.. You're not giving some irreplaceable gift to the world by modding a fucking subreddit. This is the internet, if you're not getting death threats you're not internetting right. That said, I've been sent death threats from Trump supporters before and T_D mods have always responded swiftly. Go cry to the admins. Even if you're bullshitting, they'll change some text around to make it fit anyway. [end]
[start] Fuck off OP [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2115  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/66167) [end]
[start] Was the user in the dog post related to the r/pedofriends thing? Because if anyone from that sub is crying about being harassed, that's ridiculous. Hearing people call The_Donald toxic and an echo chamber and how it should be shut down need to go to that disgusting sub and see what real evil looks like.  [end]
[start] >But when a few comments were changed by /u/spez because you guys were calling him a pedophile (with no evidence) you guys flipped out and acted like it was the next Watergate  Not acceptable. Under absolutely no circumstances is that acceptable. There's a million billion other ways to handle that sort of thing, including public statements and just generally being a better person than the people slinging mud at you. But that? That is the worst option of all the bad options and you are fucking delusional if you think it isn't. Changing user posts without their consent is not only irredeemable but also possibly illegal in a few places.  I am one comment in hundreds, now thousands. I probably won't even have my post read but I want to lump my voice in with the people who know the issues and know that what spez did is not okay. [end]

[start] I expected something like this. Then I started reading and thought "nah, this seems legit." Then you turned it around on me. You fucker. [end]
[start] I don't know what is worse, the sense of betrayal from you or the fact I know people weird enough that I never questioned the behavior being human.  Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the gold, you popped my golden cherry :) [end]

[start] This is the first time ive actually read an entirebpost of this length.. i fucking hate you. You had me hooked, i had to run jnto work miss my clock in (probably get in trouble) just to find out it was a dog! Good stuff man! Lol you had me hooked! [end]
[start] that was AWESOME! [end]
[start] This post is pure gold. This will be a copy-pasta for generations to come. See ya in greentext on the other side of the internet. [end]
[start] God fucking damn it. I don't like you. That was good... [end]
[start] Nice story sir, perfect twist at the end. [end]

[start] A similar story was posted on /r/wtf a week ago: http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/anniesday.html [end]
[start] You had me going.  [end]
[start] God damn it. [end]
[start] Omg haha this is great! [end]
[start] At the end I yelled " you mother fucker!" At work. Thanks  [end]
[start] You...you bastard...that was beautiful. I figured a man peeing in random places sounded exactly like a nervous dog. Really cute story [end]
[start] You motherfucker [end]
[start] MOTHER. FUCKER.  [end]
[start] You write plot twists the way that M. Night Shyamalan wishes he could. This might be one of the best Reddit Posts I've read in a *long* time. Every now and again we all stumble across these little gems. It's wonderful. Thanks!  http://imgur.com/vdiqirU [end]
[start] I was totally expecting a /r/nosleep post. Good job OP [end]
[start] Hilarious. You had me the while way. I never questioned him being human at all. I was trying to figure out the black eye thing pretty much the whole way, waiting for the context. Genius and well written. Would get taken again 10/10.  [end]
[start] See wall of text -> Whatever not going to read  see tl;dr -> whoa this looks good, better skim for highlights  see paragraph about cheating girlfriend -> THAT MOTHERFUCKER! Better read more for context  see picture link, can't wait to put a face to all my hatred -> utter confusion  Well done, you ass [end]
[start] Man that was hilarious. I was ready to help you find an unmarked weapon to deal with what sounded like a total douchebag! [end]
[start] Dammit! I was all ready to say how fake this was.  [end]
[start] Your a great story teller, after the punch line I had to read it all again in the dog version... [end]

[start] Figured this one out pretty quickly. The Star Wars and tree fiddy posts have trained me well [end]
[start] Can I say I was a bit relieved to read the ending? I thought this was going to be some disaster post that lead to your gf & you splitting up. Awesome ending.. [end]
[start] I get it! It's funny because Phil was a dog the whole time, but you told the story as if Phil was a human being. Classic misdirection! [end]
[start] As soon as I started reading I thought: "cat". I realized I was wrong and changed my guess on "dog" at the pizza-part. But I've read a similar thing a while ago.   Very good and entertaining writing nevertheless.  [end]
[start] You bastard. I hate you [end]
[start] Phil is adorable. Yes he is. [end]
[start] You motherfucker. I actually felt sorry for you. Now I hate you.  [end]
[start] You cuntface [end]
[start] Fuuuuuuuuck yoooouuuu. Lol [end]
[start] Obligatory M. Night Shyamalan. [end]
[start] I've never had a story do that to me before. I'm just so... I don't even know. [end]
[start] This made me pissed off at Phil until the end. Now I'm pissed at you.  [end]
[start] You... motherfucker... I like you. [end]
[start] God. Dammit. [end]
[start] Brilliant.  [end]
[start] /r/unexpected [end]
[start] I was like...dang this guy is weird and shady, took his girlfriend and his dog. Took me like 30 seconds after reading the story to realize that Phil was the dog. I am not very smart 😓 [end]
[start] Jesus OP, I was actually shaking with anger by the end of this, and then I read the final line and almost threw my phone. Bravo, you magnificent bastard. [end]
[start] You dick. That was a roller coaster of emotions. I thought this was gonna be some "Jenny" bullshit all over again, and then you straight-up shyamalaned me. [end]
[start] Hahaha, holy shit that was brilliant.  It did remind me though of one of my roommates in college.  As it happened I lived with seven other guys in an apartment style dorm room with two bathrooms and a small kitchenette.  We all got along great and became good buddies.  All of us..except Ernest.   Ernest was Indian, or Pakistani, or the like and mostly kept to himself.  When I say he kept to himself, I mean he practically lived in his bed.  Ernest would sleep, eat, study, and otherwise never leave that bed.  I honestly can't confirm if he ever showered or bathed because I only ever saw him leave when he would go to class.  It was remarkable.   We mostly left Ernest alone until one day when joking around we went into the room and looked at Ernest's bed.  You can't imagine the pile of crumbs, debris, and other miscellaneous tidbits that were in that bed.  It was horrifying.   We were all pretty grossed out after that.  It was my first brush with how weird people can be sometimes [end]
[start] Fucking Asshole [end]
[start] You fucking asshole [end]
[start] Phil sounds like he's nothing but a son of a bitch. [end]
[start] You motherfucker [end]
[start] 4chan is leaking and I love it. [end]
[start] i feel like a neglected one night stand... thank you [end]
[start] I originally read this as Phil being so disgusting in comparison to your dog that you now let the dog sleep on your bed. Didn't even click until I read the comments. [end]
[start] This is amazing, adorable, and hilarious. A true rollercoaster, this post left me on the edge of my seat and sweating from my butthole. [end]
[start] ... I need about tree-fiddy. [end]
[start] So why did you try showing your dog the different shower settings?  [end]
[start] I thought he was human! --- by far a great way to start my Wednesday. Cheers! [end]
[start] Are you fucking kidding me  [end]
[start] You made me read the whole bloody thing...and you made me laugh and smile, so that's fine with me.. [end]
[start] Bloody hell OP you had me    Edit: *Black eye* [end]
[start] You motherfucker. [end]
[start] Arrrrrg. I was ready with my pitchfork. This was such a good post to read. [end]
[start] Oh fuck you mate. [end]
[start] GOT ME GOOD FUCKER [end]
[start] You motherfucker.... Had me going to the very end... Definitley made my day though! [end]
[start] After the pissing in the kitchen thing, I was like,  "Wow, this guy is almost exactly like my asshole of a dog."  [end]
[start] I was so God damn intrigued! "He pissed on the floor?!" "Won't come in the shower room, did her dad touch him or something?" "She SLEPT WITH THAT WEIRDO?!"  [end]
[start] LOL [end]
[start] Nothing on the internet has ever made me laugh so hard! Fuck it! Have an upvote! [end]
[start] Great!!  Totally worth the read! [end]
[start] You piece of shit. [end]
[start] Going back and reading this knowing Phill is a dog changes everything.  [end]
[start] Fuck you OP! You had me going untill the end! :< [end]
[start] You fucking cunt. Well played son. [end]
[start] You sly bastard.  My jaw literally dropped when you said she invited him into her bed when you were gone.  [end]
[start] That was a bloody good one, you had me convinced the whole way. [end]
[start] My heart actually sank. That fucking hurt. You god damned asshole!  I love you, OP. [end]
[start] How do I still get fooled by these things still? D: [end]
[start] Tell me more about the train ride [end]
[start] i knew phil was furry after the pizza. [end]
[start] Oh ho Shyamalan level [end]
[start] I dedicated my 5 minutes of morning reddit time to you, fucker [end]
[start] You son of a b***** you got me right in the feels and then you YANKED The carpet back under my feet. /slow clap [end]
[start] You bastard, you got me hook, line and sinker. [end]
[start] I feel like you wasted my time. [end]
[start] Ok, but why would you explain how the shower head works to the dog? Everyone knows that dogs prefer baths. [end]
[start] I hate you. Have an upvote.  [end]
[start] When you said "having a hard time adjusting to a new place" I thought what is this dude a fucking dog.....ohhhhhhh.  [end]
[start] This is stupid. [end]

[start] What kind of dog is that? He's wicked cute. [end]
[start] Bravo. Just... Bravo. I bought in hook, line and sinker.  [end]
[start] Wow, you're dumb.  [end]
[start] The pissing on the wooden floor kinda give it away for me. Maybe it's because I just went through a similar situation and it just came to me immediately. [end]
[start] God.  Damnit. [end]
[start] You mother fucker. [end]
[start] you piece of shit i love you [end]
[start] my heart sank and then... fuck  you glorious bastard [end]
[start] Good story, but the pissing on the floor bit gave it away. It was just too weird.  Then the pizza part sealed the deal. [end]
[start] I started reading your post this morning while trying to convince myself to get out of bed. Got a phone call half way through that made me get up. Just got home from work and opened reddit to finish reading this post starting with the pizza scene. You had me going all day. Fucker. I love you.  [end]
[start] I was so fucking enraged by the end of the post, and then I realized it was just a fucking dog.  [end]
[start] I'm so glad I didn't scroll down for the TL;DR on this. I'm on my break and tend to just mindlessly scroll through posts. Great job man.  Edit: Words [end]
[start] Oh you sneaky bastard. [end]
[start] Oh....No you didn't!!  God dangit. Fooled me so badly. [end]
[start] I fucking hate love you right now [end]
[start] I was expecting Phil to be a toddler [end]
[start] The pizza was when I got it. A dog would totally do that shit. [end]

[start] > Was told to cross post this here by someone.  Woop!  Glad you did :) It really bothers me when a good post gets ruined by control freak mods. [end]
[start] From the started i just kept saying fuck this phil , at the end i said fuuck You [end]
[start] Holy fuck, how did i not see that coming? /r/unexpected would love you. [end]
[start] The pizza part had me scrolling down.  Nice story though. [end]
[start] All I could picture when reading this was Howie Mandel in "Walk like a man".  Get to the end of the story... close enough. [end]
[start] Saw the title. Knew you were fucking with us. Took me until the pee on the floor to get that it was a dog though. [end]
[start] I hope Phil continues to piss everywhere in your apartment.  [end]
[start] You sold that so well. Cute pup. [end]
[start] I got to the urine part before I start wondering.  [end]
[start] Your dog has his own room?!? You got me. Good story. [end]
[start] Great, thanks. Now I'm late for work. [end]
[start] I'm really pissed, I had this horrible picture of Phil in my head the whole time and i really disliked him. Then that all shattered when I found out it was a dog. Bravo [end]
[start] You asshole!  (Try to take it as a compliment, you got me good.) [end]
[start] That was great, literally never saw it coming  10/10 would definitely read it again. [end]
[start] I'm proud to say I spotted this pretty early on. The shower part and when you said he ran into his room - I thought "Dog. Either this is a dog or this man was raised by dogs." [end]
[start] Fuck you, man. I'm hurt... HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME? [end]
[start] Holy hell man.. so many feels going in right now I don't know what to think. You got me good.  [end]
[start] Oh you motherfucker... you really had me. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Ahh you totally had me there. I was not sure where this was going when she got in the bed with this fucking guy. I like phil. Hahaha [end]
[start] I honestly had a picture in my mind of some squirrelly dude stealing pizza and pissing in the kitchen. You bastard.  [end]
[start] Always read the tldr first. Saved a lot of time.  [end]
[start] I don't even know what to say...I was like 'the fuck?' the whole way through and then the twist. I laughed. This is a good story. I didn't even consider phil to not be human... [end]
[start] I scrolled down to the picture and ruined it for myself [end]
[start] Man, you have no idea how happy i am that phil was a cute dog. Is funny how much i worried and felt sad about someone i dont even know. [end]
[start] Very cheeky m8 had me on a ride there [end]
[start] /r/unexpected [end]
[start] BUT THEN IT WAS A DREAM THE WHOLE TIME [end]
[start] You couldn't afford to split the rent for a 2 bedroom 2 ways?  Man, you shoulda just downsized to a one bedroom, if you want revenue money then buy a revenue property. [end]
[start] I wanted this to be about some weirdo so badly. I feel betrayed  [end]
[start] You. Asshole.  [end]
[start] Goddammit OP its too early, you got me!  Why would a dog need a whole 2nd bedroom tho? [end]
[start] amazingly my dog came to me house trained from the shelter, so i thought Phil was human even after the pee incident. (what was i thinking?! [this guy.](http://i.imgur.com/V7IzgW9.jpg)) i realized it was a dog at "and a nice big slice hanging from my hand", didn't even have to wait until he stole the slice, it clicked right away. my dog takes food out of my SO's hands like it's nothing.  [end]
[start] FUCKING DAMNIT PHIL  [end]
[start] You forgiving the pissing on the floor part tipped me off.  There'd be a huge problem with YOU if allowed another man to piss on your floor and he continued living there another night. [end]
[start] TLDR [end]
[start] fuck you man:) [end]
[start] https://gfycat.com/InsecureIdioticAquaticleech [end]
[start] What is this? Reddit's version of greentext? At least don't lazy out at the end after spending all that time with the build up. [end]
[start] Fucking Phil. Now I'm reading this a second time with a new perspective. Well done sir. Phil's not so bad after all.... [end]
[start] This might be the best thing I've ever read. [end]
[start] Ahh! You got me! I was staring at my phone with this cringe expression and then I got to the "it was super cute" and I was completely confused, until I saw the picture! Then I was like awwww! Thanks man, I just had a bipolar start to my morning. [end]
[start] I was so excited reading this that I had to space it out because I didn't want the story to end... and the ending was FANTASTIC. Amazing. You got me so bad. [end]
[start] Then one time I don't read the bloody comments, cunt. Well played. [end]
[start] /r/unexpected  [end]
[start] Cheers RES, ruined that one for me with your automatic image loading... [end]
[start] Y'know something - right up to the end of this story I could have sworn you were talking about a former flatmate of mine. Even the pissing on the floor and pizza bits. I only doubted it when you said about hopping into bed with your wife, since my flatmate wouldn't have even spoken to a woman let alone get into bed with her. [end]
[start] I was reading this at work, a paragraph at a time. The suspense was amazing. I'd read a little, go and help a person that walked in thinking the whole time about what kinda person could just piss on the floor. Well done. Well done indeed.  [end]
[start] I READ THE WHOLE DAMN THING! [end]
[start] It's truly sad that this isn't in /r/funny, because it genuinely was funny! [end]
[start] That genius TL;DR [end]
[start] Goddamit, that was funny!  RES spoiled it for me when I scrolled halfway through [end]
[start] This actually made me a little mad when I found out he wasn't a human. I invested so much time reading this thinking it was a serious issue, and it wasn't!!!  [end]
[start] OP, this is why I have trust issues.  Phil is a gorgeous dog.  [end]

[start] You motherfucker... [end]
[start] Dude, BRILLIANT. You had me going right 'till the end. Bravo! [end]
[start] You brilliant person. [end]
[start] FUUUCCCKKK!  >ext day I come into the kitchen to get my lunch ready for work and the floor near the sink is a bit wet. It was hard to tell because the floor is wooden and the lighting isn't great in our kitchen but I could have sworn it looked like piss. I cleaned it up anyway and brought it up with my girlfriend after I finished work. She said it was probably just water from when she washed up the night before. I agreed and pushed it out of my mind. I woke up in the middle of the night because I heard Phil's door open so I quietly walk into the kitchen. Sure enough this guy is pissing on the floor. I don't know what to do so I shout at him and he just fucking runs past me back into his room.  I read that and could only think, "Jesus, this guy is like some kind of animal marking his territory." I'm so stupid. [end]
[start] Well done.  [end]
[start] Lol your a motherfucker but that was great! =) [end]
[start] Touche. But why would you give a dog a whole room and rush home to to catch them in bed if it was a dog.   That is a cute dog btw.  [end]
[start] I realised it was a fucking dog when he snatched the pizza from your hand. Good story nonetheless. Have an upvote.  [end]
[start] Just posting here to mark my place in history. This post will go down as one of the greats.  [end]
[start] That was really good. Well done OP. [end]
[start] This is becoming a copypasta for the next generations. [end]
[start] This is amazing! [end]
[start] People like you are the reason I love this website.  [end]
[start] Haha, you bastard! Got me good. What an adorable little guy. [end]
[start] Fuck everything about you. [end]
[start] Caught on right around pissing on the floor and not going into the bathroom, clever ruse though!  [end]
[start] Nicely done sir. Nicely done. [end]
[start] As someone who has never owned a dog I understood this as Phil was a guy who acted super wierd. You accept him for who he is. To avoid your SO cuddling with him out of loneliness you baught a dog. I just thought OP was a super chill guy that wanted to avoid confronting Phil at all costs. [end]
[start] *slow clap* [end]
[start] As soon as the piss on kitchen floor line I said out loud.  WTF IS HE A DOG?  Bam, nailed it. [end]
[start] I Shit you not, halfway through I was thinking "Is the next part where you have to move with your aunty and uncle in Bel Air?" [end]
[start] Oh my god you had me right till  the very fucking end [end]
[start] I now have atleast half of the office staring at me wondering what caused me to cover my work monitor in my half chewed lunch. [end]
[start] loved this! have 3000 bits /u/changetip [end]
[start] How the **fuck** did I not see that coming? Is this my first day on the Internet? Goddammit  [end]
[start] There is a special place in hell for you! >:( [end]
[start] On the internet, no one knows you're a dog. [end]
[start] yeah nah mate [end]
[start] What about the black eyes? did you just lie about that? [end]
[start] This is the best story I have ever read. [end]
[start] Lame [end]
[start] Oh you fabulous motherfucker, you got me! Damn, you got me good! [end]
[start] Ah, fuck you. Everything makes sense now. The shower the food and the floor in front of the sink. You got me. [end]
[start] "What the fuck? Pissing on the floor, adjusting to a new living space?? He's not a fucking dog or something, how do you put up with this?"  ...yeah, I said this to myself halfway through the story and still didn't realize until after I finished. You are good, man. [end]
[start] Fuck you. Your gf fucked a dog. [end]
[start] If this is some bs story about your girlfriend's parent's dog or some shit, you're a douche.   Edit: finished the story. You suck.  [end]
[start] I thought the peeing thing was pretty weird, but that maybe Phil had some kind of disability. The pizza thing, though... no human could ever simultaneously hold the beliefs that pissing on a floor is OK, and stealing someone's pizza from their hand is OK, without someone killing them before adulthood [end]
[start] I hate you.  [end]
[start] My dog does the exact same thing, he also won't come into the bathroom, and leaves if you try to convince him to come in. [end]
[start] ....but don't people become your in-laws when you actually marry? Or is it just common to use in-laws to describe a SO's parents now? I'm really curious about this for some reason.  [end]
[start] >enough to betray the person you've been in a relationship with for three years because she said she invited him into bed with her. I was angry, I felt sick. I didn't know what to do.  wut. no, that's just lying to mislead. [end]
[start] They say dogs are man's best friend, but I've never had my best friend take a dump in my living room. [end]
[start] motherfucker [end]
[start] You..... [end]
[start] Freaking knew it! I've read too many stories like this; I was suspicious when he pissed near the sink, and when he "grabbed" the pizza out of your hand I went straight to the pic to confirm it. [end]
[start] When you startout with " This fucking guy who moved in with us" , all possiblilties of anything other than a fucking guy and not a dog are out the window. [end]
[start] You know, someone else posted something similar but at the end of the story you find out it's a cat instead of dog. They got me and you did too. I wish I had a link to the cat one but I can't find it. [end]
[start] at least no tree fiddy and Phil ain't the Loc Ness monster [end]
[start] Mother.. fucker.. Have a goddamn.. fucking upvote you... bastard. You glorious bastard. [end]
[start] OP, do I have your permission to translate it in Bulgarian (with link to the Reddit thread as well)? [end]
[start] When you said that he went to bed with you Girlfiend I inmediatedly thought Phil only wanted some kisses and her to play a little with her penis. [end]
[start] Is your GF's name jenny? [end]
[start] Ima punch you in the dick, it's been AGES since I read something like this [end]
[start] Wow you got me........ [end]
[start] That… was amazing. You made my heart explode with anxiety  [end]
[start] Dude is weird [end]
[start] You motherfucker...that was brilliant. Take my upvote! [end]
[start] You totally had me until about two-thirds of the way through. Then I had my suspicions. :) Very fun! Sucks that he peed on your floor though. [end]
[start] Ok 1: i had to start reading it with an English accent half way through.  And 2: I thought Phil was a person and it took me about 3 minuets of solid think to figure it out [end]
[start] That was an awesome read. Thank you. [end]
[start] Goddammit OP... [end]
[TITLE] I am almost 65 years old and all alone in this world... I have no partner, no children, no friends, just regrets and I want you to avoid my mistakes [TITLE]
[start] Your life isn't over yet my man! Thank you for inspiring me! [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] You write really well. You should write a memoir that is a letter to Gordon that tells your story. Would be a fascinating read. [end]
[start] I sent this to my friend who's 18 and he told me to thank you in his name and he even said he cried a bit. Thank you! :) [end]
[start] 23 right now, sounds like me in the future. [end]
[start] You have immense value as a writer, and you should find a passion and write about it.  &#x200B;  You also, not even 'for your age' (but--in a way) have accumulated a good headspace and ability to seek out information and relevant sources of output (and presumably good input). You found reddit, you write like a 32 year old, and cogitate like a 25 year old.  &#x200B;  Your life is not over--its not embarrassing, and is worth living to fullest; to this very day. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] My friend, 65 is still young enough to do a lot of things. I think you should talk to a therapist about your anxiety so your next 20+ years are better! Try online dating, go to a strip club, go hunting, pick up a new hobby.   Just yesterday I saw the cutest video on Reddit of two 100 year olds who just tied the knot. It’s never too late to live, it’s never too late to make new memories. Make your next few years the best you’ve ever had! [end]
[start] I really enjoyed reading this , it wasnt scattered or confusing more like a greatly narrated quick 60 second life story. Try maybe adopting a pet :) [end]
[start] Jesus what a tough one [end]
[start] Please follow your own advice. The idea of perfection can be debilitating but it would be truly sad if in another year or ten or twenty you still felt the same. A pet is such a great idea and if that's not your thing try seeking out other ways to bring happiness to others. A lot of love can occur in a year. Relationships are not cumulative. They ebb and flow like all things in life. Please do not measure yourself by these standard but instead by the potential you have to impact your community.  64 is not the end of the road. I have suffered from risk aversion most of my life and I can see how it has held me back from maturing at the same rate as my peers. Mistakes are human and as soon as you start making more of them you can really open yourself up to a lot of living.    I'll be rooting for you. [end]
[start] Are you coming out? This is beautiful! [end]
[start] It will change someone's life. We love you. [end]
[start] Ahhh, that last paragraph hit me right in the feels.  Well written.  But I gotta say - dude, you're 65.  That's not like 'rush you off to the old folks home' age, and you mentioned you are in decent health.  Fuck the world, get out there and do all the things you never did.  You still have plenty of time :) [end]
[start] Hey man, you made it this far. Maybe it would feel good to do some volunteer work - you can volunteer to befriend lonely old people, and I'd bet they'd like you better than the 20-something volunteers. Something like this [(Friend to Friend link)](https://friendtofriendamerica.org/) maybe? You've still got love in you, put that stuff to good use, you deserve it.  It can be hard to get out, but sometimes you owe it to yourself to force yourself to do what you know is good for you. You'd do it for Gordon, Gordon would want you to do it for you. [end]
[start] i’m 19 years old right now, female, virgin, haven’t dated in years, hardly hangs out with friends, stays home for weeks at a time rarely going out because of anxiety though i’m trying to get my meds upped. i’m scared this will be my life although i don’t mean to sound rude but i also don’t show much emotion to friends, they only see happy bubbly me. i never cry in front of them, never get angry, never sad, nothing, because i was made fun of for crying over something and well now i’m too embarrassed to show any other emotion besides happy. i don’t really know what to do at this point but i might try going out today and walk my dogs but yeah i don’t know how to change my life my anxiety and depression tell me people will judge me for everything i do and i even tell myself i shouldn’t wear/do certain things cause it’s ugly or pathetic or whatever, idk maybe i’ll see a therapist or something but i also have major trust issues with people in person and i have never opened up to someone before so i’m not sure how that will go but it’s nice to hear that i’m not the only one who seems to live like this and that it’s not just me and i’m the non normal one [end]
[start] You may well have another 30 years to live. That's a long time. So I think your advice applies to you, too. You have a long time to try to find some more fulfillment in life. I'd highly recommend seeing a therapist to work through some of your anxiety. It can help immensely. You just need to listen to your own advice and start taking some risks. [end]
[start] What would Gordon say to you?  Would he slap you heartily on the back, congratulate you for making it to age 65 with your hair and your teeth, dry your tears and pour you a drink and remind you that you can't change yesterday, and tell you it's time now to go live the great life that you deserve to live? To go on an adventure and see where it takes you?  I think you're not at the end - you're only at the end of the beginning. At your age, Colonel Harland Sanders was broke and hadn't yet started opening any Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants. [end]
[start] Damn man, this is heavy. Incredibly well written - reads like a short story. I am sorry and I wish you the best of luck, friend. [end]
[start] Well I did lose a love for being a coward too... And is horrible pain. [end]
[start] OP, I am so sorry. Friends really are important to everyone.    To Reddit readers: if you can relate to OP's description of not having friends because of anxiety, consider therapy and anxiety meds or antidepressants. A little bit of therapy, and the right meds, can greatly change your outlook on  taking risks socially. [end]
[start] Your story resonates with me so much even though I am an almost 60 year old woman and widow. Your life is not over by any means.   You’ve made a very lovely first step by posting. I’m sure that most of the comments here will be kind and helpful. Disregard the other idiots.   If you ever just want to communicate with a person who knows isolation, please message me. It’s a little different now, but pen pals can still be a thing.   Regardless, I wish the best for you. [end]
[start] Dude, 65 is not old. You could easily have 3 more decades. Or you could get hit by a bus tomorrow.  Point is, you’ve already done the hard part and identified the mistakes you’ve made. So now you just need to get off your butt and go make some different mistakes. Follow your own advice, as others have said.  And congrats on still having your hair! [end]
[start] Damn. This  post hit me right in the heart. The only thing I have to say is    > >Don't do what I did. Don't be so scared to be yourself. Don't be so terrified to take risks. Don't wait endlessly for life to put something good on your path, because life won't do any such thing.  > >Please do not grow old and let the years pass by uneventfully. Don't wait for golden years to arrive without effort, without risk, without ups and downs and struggles. I tried so hard to avoid struggles out of that crippling fear and anxiety I always felt, and it got me nowhere.   You're 65. Obviously you aren't young, but take your own advice. When your 85 you're going to be regretting the shit you didn't do at 65, when you still have your health [end]
[start] Hey, I want you to pick up a book called "meditations" by Marcus Aurelius.   Read through it, it's pretty short.   Then write, you write very well. I'm not sure what you do for a living but this post managed to evoke feelings from thousands of people, people who I know would read a book/poem written by you.   You got a talent, let me know when you publish I'll buy it. [end]
[start] Hi,   &#x200B;  I signed up literally to comment on this, I dunno, felt like I should. You might not even see this.   &#x200B;  But as you said, you're almost only 65 and very healthy - you have so much time left, it kind of sounds like you've given up. Maybe this could be a new start now? Now that you've realised something about yourself.   &#x200B;  My Grandma passed away 11 years ago, my Grandad was 63 years old. They had been together their whole lives, he really could have just given up once she had gone but he didn't. At 65 years old he found a new girlfriend, he has been with her for 9 years, they travel the world together, look after each other, support each other, challenge each other and she has given him a whole new life - that he loves. He is so happy.   &#x200B;  What I'm trying to say, is that it's not too late. You can meet someone, like Gordon, that you can be honest with. Your true self with and spend the rest of your life happy. Please don't give up now. Something incredible could be just around the corner if you gave it a look. [end]
[start] Damn, what a story... Dude if you need a new friend I would be happy to chat, I've been a bit lonely lately anyway so I could use it too. I'm 22 btw.  Furthermore I agree with the guy saying to make the next 20+ years the best. You may say you're an old man but there's plenty of time left, so make it count! [end]
[start] This is absolutely incredibly written. Even tho you say you have never been able to show your emotions what u wrote here was the most raw and emotion filled thing I’ve ever read. You are able to show all these emotions through your writing and u are truly so so talented. I wish u the best of luck in anything u do. I want to say I don’t know u but from reading this post I found a feeling of love from you. I want to say I love u. I am saying this because I mean it. You seem like the most amazing soul and I want you to know people love u. I am a stranger but I still have feeling of love from u and I wish u the best. [end]
[start] Wow the only reddit post that has made me cry [end]
[start] I want the Original Poster and everyone else to know that there are people who will love you and appreciate you for being exactly who you are - wonderful, flawed, and uniquely you.  We are all walking around lonely - Looking for our partners, our friends, our tribe.  Yet, we hide ourselves from each other.  Yes, some people will hurt you, hate you, ridicule you, reject you, and even attack you.  But, someone and your tribe are are also looking for you. But, they will never find you unless you risk being who you are.   To the original poster, I want to say that it is not too late.  You are not too old.  Relationships can be about more than time left (what if you have 5 - 10 -20 years to share?), more than about sex.  It's about the the connection, the companionship, the multiple types of intimacy, and it's about the love.  If any of us have only a day left, don't waste it.  It is still not too late. [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing this 🏅🥇 [end]
[start] 33 in a few days, part of me I can relate about being alone for too long it’s hard being in a relationship with someone. It’s easier to just be alone even though all I crave is to marry someone but I just can’t seem to find the right one. [end]
[start] I am utterly blown away and speechless. This is the most beautiful thing I think I've ever come across on reddit. I feel like weeping. Thank you so much for sharing your story. You write so beautifully and the message is clear and important.   I would love to be your friend. If you're lonely and need someone you talk to... I am here and I am listening. Feel free to message me anytime.  Peace be with you, dear stranger. Thanks for that bit of perspective... I needed to hear that today. [end]
[start] computer games [end]
[start] Thank you. [end]
[start] Damn dude [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing your story. You write very eloquently. I am 28 and can relate to parts of your story, including intermittent depression and anxiety - I have recently started seeing a therapist. I have been living on my own these past 3 years, and have a pretty quiet job right now. Many of my friends from college have been getting married, or are in relationships. I do feel lonely at times, at both work and home. I have been going to Meetup groups the past year, and have made some great new friends through Meetup and work. I haven't yet been in a relationship - I hid my true self for far too long, but have been working on being open and honest these past few years to my closest friends. Your story has been the reminder I needed to hear: Keep on persevering, and making every day count.   &#x200B;  You are very brave, and please know your story has touched many. I'm proud of you for sharing, many fellow redditors are, and I'm sure Gordon is proud, too. [end]
[start] Come to Thailand. I will show you how wonderful life can/should be. Lots of retired expats here living the dream or atleast living a better life than what they had in their country.  Seroius offer. Get a passport. Get out of the house and travel. You still have time. Don't waste anymore of it. [end]
[start] Have you ever thought about thru-hiking the Appalachian trail? /r/appalachiantrail  It's a lifetime of experiences crammed into six months. Please think about it.  I'm doing so next year and I relate to your story quite a lot. [end]
[start] You have no idea how badly I needed this. My 29 year old stone faced male self is bawling. I’ve recently been contemplating the mistakes I’ve made, the people I’ve wronged, and the opportunities I’ve missed. Especially today. I just finished writing a letter to my ex that’s a year too late. Not for a chance at redemption but to let her know she’ll always be family to me and I’ll always be there should she need me. We were together 7 years and I never had her back like she had mine. My closest friends moved on with their lives and taken their own paths. She was all I had left. The only person I could and did happily call my best friend. And I ran away. I was scared I was being held back but I didn’t realize I was holding myself back. I avoid any interaction that’s not forced on me. I have dreams and potential but no drive. I’m a sports car without gas. I lack the core element that could make me a successful, or even full functioning, human being. I can and do ride a motorcycle doing 90 on freeways in LA, I’ve befriended a man who was about to rob me, I’ve even thrown myself off a flight of stairs attached to a bike. But when it comes to taking risks that could amount to positive changes, I cower. As I cry writing this, I have no idea how to change. I’m sure you’re a good man. You seem very much so. But I don’t want to end up like you. And if you get nothing else out of life, know that your story, real or not, has broken me down. And I’m telling myself now I’m ready to be built back up.  I wish you positive change. [end]
[start] Halfway there already myself :/  34, kissless virgin, etc.  In my case, my future was stolen from me before I was even born, because SOMEONE couldn't keep her damn hands off hard drugs and alcohol for 9 months.  As a kid I wanted to be an airline pilot. No dice, my profound hearing loss killed it. Politician? No dice, too many psych issues and several skeletons in the closet from before I finally conquered my impulse control. Tornado chaser? Refuse to drive cuz Im too easily distracted by my constant daydreaming and fantasizing. Etc.  Physically, you wouldnt tell I was an high functioning "R-word" unless you either saw my old skinnier self or hear me speak.  I cant date cuz my abusive, manipulative, and gaslighter adopted mom is the kind of person who will go behind my back and reveal all my skeletons in my closet to any potential partner. ESPECIALLY the one sexual one that I will be kicking myself in the ass for for the rest of my life :/ [end]
[start] This is going to get buried because you have so many replies, but I wanted to at least say something because your post really touched me.   Like everyone else said, this is beautifully-written and I think it could be really neat if you were to start writing, even if it's just to keep a journal and sort out your thoughts. I have journaled off and on for many years and it has been a fulfilling hobby that gave me a lot of insight into my thoughts and feelings. However, journaling does not solve loneliness- I have definitely learned that . For that piece of the puzzle, you might look into some cool hobbies that have clubs, classes, or meetups associated with them. Things like ceramics, bonsai, rockhounding, hiking, tabletop gaming, plant swaps, etc all have clubs or groups that you can join to meet people and explore a new pastime. It can get harder to meet people in your adult/older years, but a lot of hobbyists are more than willing to teach and nerd out with you about a subject they are passionate about! It can be a great way to make new friends.   All that aside, more importantly- in another comment you said you think you are coming out. CONGRATULATIONS! Some of us are lucky enough to know and accept this stuff early on in life, but many of us don't realize we may be gay/bi/queer/etc for a long time due to societal pressures, repression, fear, etc. Others have mentioned this, but there it is not too late to live the life that you want to live. In most places (at least in the US, Europe, and many other places) there are thriving LGBTQ+ communities waiting to accept you with open arms. Personally, I have never found any community more accepting and full of love than the gay community. No one cares how old you are, no one cares if you're "new". Just find LGBTQ meetups, gay bars, LBGT centers, and show up. Tell them you're new to all this and then keep showing up to stuff. You will find friendship, you will find community, you will feel that feeling of being Home.   Sorry that this is long. I hope you get a chance to read it and I hope all of us here on Reddit have convinced you that it's too early to be looking back on your life with such deep regret. You are not lacking, you are a work in progress with a good three decades left to live how you want to live and create the fellowship you crave. I am 100% rooting for you and I know you can do it! ❤ [end]
[start] I know I am just a random guy on the Internet, but I will be your friend :-) if you need someone to talk to, I am always here.  I had a friendship much like yours. We had met in karate class when I was 11 and he was 13. I saw him sitting alone looking sad so I ran over and made it a point to talk to him. I'd never seen him smile, but that day I was able to make him laugh. We farted around in karate for awhile after that and I could see he was finally having fun. He often took himself too seriously, something he would do until the day we parted ways.  We built fish tanks together. We played online games together, played outside catching bugs and hitting baseballs. We sat for long nights talking about the people we wanted to be and the things we wish we had. Neither of us were rich nor were we social winners by any means. But we had each other.  Admittedly, I always knew he loved me, in a special way only a man can love another man. Due to our overbearing religious households, I never even knew anything like that existed until I was older. In the 80s, being a man's man was something that would get you beaten or shunned or both. I thought he was just a good friend. And he was.  We grew up. I found many girlfriends but he was always alone. It often made him sad. I did my best to cheer him up, and as I grew older I realized, I'm the man he wishes he could have had. This was evident on the day of my wedding, when I held him in my arms in the back lawn and we just cried together. I'd be moving soon, and we would never see each other again.  We talked often. 2000 miles apart. Internet still wasn't huge like it is today. But the conversations were never like they used to be. He was always dismissive of my girlfriends, but loved my wife, I think, because she truly loved me and made me happy.  I always felt guilt I could never give him the love he wanted me to give. But I did the best I could. We had so many fun drunk nights at bars and went out for exquisite cuisine together because why not. We never fooled around or anything, but I don't think either of us really wanted that.  I had an emotional breakdown and had to go no-contact. He really needed a counselor or priest or therapist or someone to listen to his problems. It just broke me that I was only able to do so much and he needed professional help. As you can imagine, the thinly-veiled threats of suicide from loneliness and a whole bunch of other assorted issues had worn me thin. And I had my own. God knows I had my own.  It broke my fucking heart. I tried to reach out a few years later but he would have nothing of it. I wrote him letters with a SASE inside. Never got anything. Scoured social media. Nowhere to be found. Typical him, anyway. I knew I'd never find him again. Which is a goddamn shame because he was the bestest friend anybody could ever have had.  If you're out there, Paul: I still love you and miss you, and think of you often. You're still in my dreams and I still hold everyone to a high standard because you were just so damn awesome. I miss you. [end]
[start] Wow. Was reading this in a public place and really wasn't ready. Now I'm uncomfortably trying to hold that one tear of emotion. [end]
[start] I don't think it's over for you. 65, 105, no matter the number, the important thing is that you're alive and free to make choices. You are free to make changes.  You've acknowledged the mistakes you've made. Now it's time to use what you learned to create meaningful relationships in your life. Who knows, maybe your later years will be the best years of your life :) [end]
[start] You’re still breathing. It’s not too late.  Granted unless you’re rich your dreams of fucking a hot young thing are probably over, but life isn’t over yet bud.  Start living. You’re an old man. There’s literally no social faux pas you can commit that people will hold you accountable for. You’re an elder. Let the lid off pal. As long as you’re not screaming racial epithets in a Starbucks, you’ll probably be fine. [end]
[start] Thank you. [end]
[start] 16 year old here with a whole life ahead of me. Before I read the post I already felt like a screwup this early in my life and that nothing better is coming for me. But after your beautifully written text I must say that you've somewhat changed my opinion on my previous misfortunes and my current situation for the better.  Godspeed u/WeighedButLacking . Godspeed [end]
[start] This is so beautiful, it’s like a haunting siren song.   I’m not crying. [end]
[start] With my most utmost sincere respectfully wish to remind you that men can still procreate at 65 (Clint Eastwood, Julio Iglesias) and you are probably living in a world where you can manage with modern medicine to live another comfortable 40-50 years. Snap outta the belated midlife crisis man and go grab your life by the horns!!! [end]
[start] Man, this one will stick with me for a while. I’m so sorry you’re lonely. I think you’re on the right track in wanting to travel to those places Gordon is connected to. It would make a hell of a book, even if you just self-publish it on Amazon or do it as a blog you update from around the world. I’d read it. Traveling opens up so many doors, philosophically, and may be a way for you to get some closure.   You said you don’t know exactly what your orientation is. I just want you to know that you CERTAINLY would not be the only man to have ever come out later in his life, especially because for your generation it was much more taboo than now. I know people who didn’t come to the realization until they were in their 70s. I came out late too, and I was so shocked and so happy to find that I wasn’t the only one. It made me feel like I wasn’t as broken as I thought. There are social organizations out there where you could feel safe to share your story and connect with others. Please feel free to PM me. [end]
[start] I wish my husband and I could have you over for dinner. It’s not too late to make connections and stop being lonely. You sound like such a beautiful soul. [end]
[start] You should read "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius. Maybe this book will give you some peace. [end]
[start] This made me incredibly sad and brought tears to my eyes. I'm still very young but I'm so scared of not having enough time to do all the things I want to do. Wish I could have 9 lives and meet all the people I wanna meet and visit all the places I dream of.  But I know I only have one life and I need to pick only certain things I wanna do before getting to old.  Thank you for your story, sir! Wish I could give you a hug. [end]
[start] The worst thing in life anyone can do is not fail. Being worried about the outcome or scared to try is a crutch that we all face. Our doubts get the best of us a lot.  Learning to not care about failure but to relish and learn from it is the best thing anyone can do. Failing to fail is stupidity but failing to improve shows that you are pushing your limits. Each time one does that your limits or possibilities improve until you can set your mind to tasks you once thought impossible.  I wish the kids coming out of high school were taught how to learn from failure instead of being ridiculed by it. It just makes us not want to face it and not want to risk making mistakes.  If anyone is reading this, noone cares if you make mistakes. Most would forget about that mistake in minutes. If you keep pushing yourself to improve you more than likely won't make the same mistake multiple times. It honestly feels exhilarating knowing you might fail, but what if you don't? [end]
[start] Why not try to take your own advice? [end]
[start] This is very sad. I am sorry you had to go through this. But I hope it's never too late, and you will still have a great life ahead of you where you can do everything you weren't able to do before.  Also there must be women which are into older men ;)  And this post gave me an idea of making simple gatherings for people, which struggle the same way you do. I've also noticed with my own eyes how far they go in their choices of attending places just to group up but with a reason to hide behind for less awkardness. They will choose to go for weird political gatherings or weird events no one really cares about just to get a chance to be with people and make friends. We kind of did it too with my now-friends at some time when we did not know each other.  We meet a lot and often, but the circle is kind of closed even though big enough. Rarely new people come in, even though we are quite open for anyone. Maybe it's the natural state, I don't know, I don't complain. Happy with the way things are with my friends.  It's just maybe we gotta think of those who can't be our friends  because of their issues, childhood traumas for example. Or people who get no opportunities to socialize.   Must note, I live in Azerbaijan, it's a bit different here with opportunities. Not as easy as it might be in Europe or America, but I don't know enough to say for sure. There aren't many cool events around, neither enough places to chill in. Not even good parks with trees, all of them are dry. And people are like always watching each other, always curious and judgemental, as if stalking but negatively and jealously. Might sound normal but here it's weirder.  So thinking if I should just make an online announcement of everyday gathering at some hour in a park at a specific spot. Just to talk or sit, walk together silently maybe do nothing, without any reason except to meet and learn about eachother and make a chance for new friendships, connections to be born.   But maybe I am going too far. Maybe making therapies more abailable and acceptable would be a better choice.   Edit: VRChat!(or something similar and better) You should try it! If you have enough resources find a way to build whatever is needed and try it. I've never tried it myself but I've heard and seen a lot about it. It might have some flaws but it can make social things one click away from you whenever you want. If you manage to befriend some people there with similar interests you might even meet up later in real life. I mean, you might never overcome your fears maybe they're pathological who knows. But in Vrchat, you won't worry that much, there's not much embarrassment when your identity is anonymous. You can hone your social skills there as well. [end]
[start] I know you meant this post as positive, and it is, but I feel so sad for you. I’m so sorry, I hate to hear of a human so unsatisfied with how they lived their lives. Few things really tug on my heart strings from the internet these days, and this did. I’m 20 now and already doing everything to avoid this kind of regret(no offense meant truly). But I can’t live with myself if I stay stagnant and if that means I gotta make mistakes to learn and grow, so be it. So I guess, thanks for writing this post, it’s a slap in the face and a shot to the heart, thank you for sharing. I hope you find peace and happiness in whatever you do, and I wish you the best of luck. [end]
[start] Tl;dr: "GET OFF OF REDDIT AND GO OUT AND LIVE YOUR LIVES, YOU NERDS!" [end]
[start] Gosh this makes me not want to be so reserved. [end]
[start] Oh hey, existential dread, that was a good 3 weeks we didn't met, how you doin'? [end]
[start] Damn dude. You say you have all these things you wished. If you’re in good health you’re probably only half way through your conscious life. I mean honestly it may just be starting because now you’re awake to what matters. Why not try to start connecting with people? You write that you realize that now you’d want to tell him. Shit go find other people, you’ll definitely meet people you wish you hadn’t but even finding one person is worth all the assholes.  It’s the first step to understand you need to make a change, the next is acting on the new revelation. When your mind starts to tell you such and such will make you uncomfortable, use that. Use that as the arrow that points the direction you need to go. Resistance is your friend, if you know how to use it. [end]
[start] Damn I gotta go do shit [end]
[start] I have got to tell you how much this speaks to me. I’m very much on that same path. I need to make some changes. I’ve always been the one left behind by friends and family. Now it’s time for me to go find myself.   Thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] Gordon’s friend and love...   I’ve not felt so present in somebody’s story in a very, very long time. I was right there in that backyard with you and Gordon. I could feel the afternoon sun upon your skin, and feel the way he smiled at you.   Gordon loved you. Oh how he loved you. That is so clear from your truth that you have written.    I know that you desperately wish that you had said those words aloud. But he knew. Every time you smiled at him, you said ‘I love you’, and every time he returned that smile, he said ‘I love you too’.    Most of our communication is non-verbal.   Once you have said see you later to Gordon, it’s time to start living. For Gordon. And for yourself. Travel through the Netherlands and Europe like you wish to. What an incredible opportunity.    You are *only* 60 years young. The average male life expectancy is roughly 79 years old. You have your health. That is the most enormous gift that you could possibly possess. I am in my twenties and incurably Ill with a genetic syndrome. I’ve spent the last 13 years mostly in my bed   Now is the time to live the life you’ve never had. Can you start afresh? Would you have the courage if you began somewhere where nobody knows you? What if you even moved to somewhere crazy like the Netherlands?    Go on some dinner dates with some lovely gentlemen. Take it slow, promise us that. You’ve  so many Reddit friends here now to help guide and support you through dating. Have some fun! It doesn’t have to go anywhere. Just some company, a nice evening with a handsome fellow.    Join some groups which interest you. A writing group for the love of all that is holy.    You have a gift. You must write. Whether it’s on a computer, a laptop, your phone, an exercise book in pen, every single day you must write. About anything, everything, nothing. Join r/WritingPrompts and r/WritersGroup    Most of all, remember we are here. And you have Gordon with you every step of the way cheering you on, for you carry him with you now in your heart, every single day. [end]
[start] I have to admit, I have conflicted feelings. On one hand, your writing is poignant and compelling. On the other hand, I see you partake in things like MGTOW and can't help but wonder if maybe you don't deserve the large amount of pity you're getting in this thread. Maybe you're this way because of the kind of values people share in MGTOW. Or maybe you participate because you're bitter. Which is it - chicken or egg?  I went into your post history to find more beautiful but haunted things and all I feel like I found was a disappointing explanation. But at least that means you're really good at writing. I'm sure my post will attract negative attention but it goes to show how easy it is to trick people's minds when you wrap ugly things in fancy paper. [end]
[start] But... he was straight with a wife? I'm confused. [end]
[start] Thanks op, this really made me reevaluate my life [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing [end]
[start] You know... Life isn't over until it's over, so don't give up so easily. You can still transform it in something you like [end]
[start] It is absolutely incredible that you took the time to share your life regrets in an effort to ensure others take the risks you avoided. You realize that you could have another 20 years on this earth. Your life isn’t over. Take the risks you wish you took. Any excuses you come up with not to take a chance are just that, excuses. It is never too late. I am 50 and decided I wasn’t going to spend potentially the next half of my life as miserable and angry as the first half. Each day is an effort to change but I am doing it. You can too!! [end]
[start] If you're afraid of people, love the world. It will love you back. Even if you hadn't shared this I hope you know that at least I love you. I know there are more people like me too, so please never be afraid to love openly. We support you. [end]
[start] Hi,  I am moved by your story. It took a tremendous amount of courage and strength. I’m a Clinical Psychologist with a lot of experience in treating anxiety disorders. It sounds to me like you are suffering from social anxiety disorder. It is highly treatable with the right treatment, namely Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). I hope you will consider seeking treatment. You can close this very long chapter of your life and start a new chapter. Your story matters. Your story is just beginning. [end]

[start] >I married at the age of fifty. I was a virgin when I married. And perhaps underuse of equipment causes malfunction, because I was unable to have a child with her. Which is why she decided to leave me.  Wait.. how old was your wife? [end]
[start] Thanks for this enlightening post. At the same time I wanna say, this isn't the end for you. You realized what you did wrong, what you should have done, don't you think it would give you more peace of mind if you actually tried now? Every day alive is a day to better ourselves isn't it? Every day to learn something new to try something new. [end]
[start] It's been so difficult to live the rest of my life since my fiance's death. My hope for the future left with him and I've been living in fear of how I'll be able to face the world without him. I know I can't live my life in fear and I'll never get a chance at happiness again unless I grab it for myself. He's gone, but now I have to live my life for the both of us.    Thank you for sharing your story. [end]
[start] Sending you love. You're feeling the darkness now, but it's not too late for you to find happiness. I hope you will find the love you deserve. [end]
[start] There are very few posts on reddit that are well written and this is one of such posts.   Even I am afraid to approach people. I am 22 and till have now I have somehow managed to make friends. But those are not meaningful friendships. Part of the reason is because I overthink stuff. I feel like they don't want to be with me. But since the past month I've been sitting in the house and it all feels so weird. They did want to be with me but I didn't let them. [end]
[start] First and foremost, thank you for sharing. It takes a lot of courage to be publicly self-reflective and vulnerable, and I think this demonstrates a lot of strength on your part. I also believe so much good can come from sharing our experiences!  Second of all, 65 is hardly “old,” my man! Of course, I don’t know your current state of health, but generally speaking, ya gotta lot years left, friend. Your tale is still being told :)   I had a thought as I was reading, and I wondered if you have ever looked into volunteering somewhere? It can be such a great way to meet and connect with people because you already have something in common. Also, a large demographic of volunteers are retired folks, so you’re likely to meet people in a similar age range, which may help in forming friendships. I don’t know what your interests or beliefs are, but just based off your post, you might find some fulfillment and satisfaction in being a mentor! You could help support young men who are going through what you did, you know?   Lastly, don’t be too hard on yourself. You have acknowledged your mistakes and regrets in life. You’re making atonements. I hope your next steps are forgiving yourself, letting the regrets go, and living the rest of your life in a way that brings you joy ✨  Also, I am so sorry for the passing of your friend. Grief is a real fucker, so be sure to be kind to yourself. Someone I loved most in the world passed away this last year, and something that helps me is to try to live my life in a way that will make them proud, as a way to honor them. I wish you healing on your journey :) [end]
[start] You’re not an old man. 80 is the old man mark nowadays. [end]
[start] Serious question.  Perhaps you are gay?  From what I read it seems like you might be.  Have you ever explored that aspect? [end]
[start] I'm 34, transgender and asexual.  This is my life in a nutshell. I desperately want to meet people and do things and hopefully one day meet someone who accepts me and brings that "light" into my life.  But mostly I work, I tinker with hobbies and I sit in my room on my computer, alone and depressed. The few people in my life dont know how depressed I am, how many times I've thought of how much easier it would be for it to just end, or that the only reason that hasn't happened is because I know my dog would be broken afterwards and I cant handle that thought.  Depression and loneliness are powerful forces and hard to shake off. [end]
[start] Young man you can make a living off this!   Firstly realize what you lost for being shy so now embrace it and make use of this so it makes a difference at the end of it all!  Secondly go to conferences and speak out and teach the younger of what NOT to do!   Thirdly get known enough and write a great book of your story with the help of a writer if needed and inspire the younger youth on what NOT to do and what to do, etc!  God Bless and wish you luck! Hope you get encouraged enough and make a difference in this world in which much help is needed. [end]
[start] I feel you. Regret and fear just suck. If you were to imagine yourself in 15 years  looking back at the present, what would your future self wish that your present self had done? [end]
[start] I barely feel teary from anything, but this post makes me want to cry... This is so powerful. That could sound like me in the future if I keep being scared to take risks.  I'm 27 now. There are many things I wish I had done in high school and coliege so I made regrets. After college, I started to realize that I should take risks and it's ok to make mistakes. Even if it wasn't successful, at least I tried!!  My biggest challenge is to approach opposite sex and ask out. Yes, I regretted never to try in the past as well. I was so scared of rejection. I hope I'll be able to do that someday when there is a guy I'm interested in next time.  You are right we shouldn't wait for something good to happen in our lives or our "golden years." I shouldn't let years pass on. That's what I needed to be reminded. :) [end]
[start] Hey! What advice would you say to someone who is more or less just like you, but younger? [end]
[start] Mike? [end]

[start] Man this scares me. Last month my wife left me and I just got served divorce papers, and I'm terrified this will be my life now. She's all I've ever known and I don't want anyone else but I think she's done.  Your story saddens me because it's easy to see how easily the years can slip by.  I hope you can get through this buddy. I hope I can too. [end]
[start] 65 is not to old to get out there and have some fun.  Travel, there are many destinations out there, and there are many good people to meet.  Go have some fun. [end]
[start] You just did what you regret not doing.   Thank you for doing this. [end]
[start] Wow...   The way you write about your life regrets/mistakes is so haunting and it touched me straight to my soul.   I’m thankful I’m living my life without to much fear of mistakes. However, I do hold myself back a lot, with some decisions, out of fear of making a mistake. I can’t do that anymore. I play life way to safe with some of my decisions. Especially in regards to my career. I’m in my mid 30’s so I need to get my butt in gear.   I’m going to change that tomorrow by applying to a few jobs within my company that interest me. Maybe even go outside my company.    Thank you for writing this! Just reading the comments, I can see you have changed a lot of people’s perspectives and in doing so, their lives. Including mine.   Thank you OP. [end]
[start] This post hit something in me. I'm gay. I'm not sure if thats what you'd call yourself, but we're both men who like men, or at least have the potential to, anyway...  I'm 20 years old atm but I've already written off having any kind of romantic relationship, not so much because I think I'm not capable of one but because I've always been comfortable with just myself. I like being my own best friend, the thought of opening myself up entirely to another person is disturbing. I think I might have an ego problem?  I wonder though, about the far future...maybe I'll regret not putting myself out there. What if all my friends marry and get busy with their own lives...I dunno. I just feel like if I need someone to know me romantically I'd have to be incredibly comfortable with them, and the only person I'm like that with is myself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I guess time will tell. This post definitely got me thinking haha  I don't think you have to give up on your life yet, maybe you could find a hobby. It's never too late! [end]
[start] This is my life in a nutshell. I turn 38 I'm a few months. I woke up one morning, realised I did not like where I was, decided to spend 2019 getting my money right. I'm going to let my business partner be the CEO of our growing business, then I'm going to pack, emigrate to Caribbean and start my life over. I met with my emigration case officer 2 days ago. Its never too late. [end]
[start] So far in my life I have been afraid and anxious of what people thought in my (very premature) career because my inexperience made me feel stupid and I did not know what the right choices were. While I’ve been job searching and feeling a little down about my inexperience I’ve been coming upon the realization that I’m scared for little reason. Thank you for posting this. I will try my best to embrace this in the future. [end]
[start] Going to save this to read every once in a while. Thank you. [end]
[start] I'll take you post to heart. Sleep easy good sir. [end]
[start] This fucking hurts after the month ive had [end]
[start] > Please do not grow old and let the years pass by uneventfully. Don't wait for golden years to arrive without effort, without risk, without ups and downs and struggles. I tried so hard to avoid struggles out of that crippling fear and anxiety I always felt, and it got me nowhere.   Reading this, a healthy 25 year old who does nothing but avoid responsibilities, loving herself, accepting herself, doing what she's always wanted to do... Staying in my comfort zone.   I have nothing to offer you, but you do. You have so much. You could do this as blog, as a podcast, if you want. This made me so scared, because none of our lives really matters, does it? Also, the last part about you having to wait for death... I'm so sorry, but you don't. You shouldn't. I realize it's hard to change now, heck it's hard to change now for me! But, your story matters. Don't let it go to waste.   Another thing, this whole thing reminded me of this gem I found on reddit:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCBAOagxanA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCBAOagxanA)  (Credit to the original artist is also in the description of that video) [end]
[start] Why can't you take your own advice OP? If you are of reasonable health then there's a good chance that you still have 25+ years ahead of you, (probably significantly more since medical technology is becoming more advanced every year).   So instead of feeling sorry for yourself, why not go out and live the life you've always dreamed of living. It would be an awful shame for you to make a similar post 30 years from now about being a lonely 95 year old man. [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing this. I just made a post about how I feel, and your advice and life experience makes me feel like I need to take more risks in my life. Thank you again. [end]
[start] I'm 26 and this is like a wake-up call for me. Thanks for writing this up [end]
[start] I’m 60 and I’d like to thank you.   I can’t get your beautiful story out of my mind.    Not having any regrets has stuck within my mind.  I think we all go through life the same way where we let go of a chapter, but I’m here to tell you, one can revisit past friendships.   I hope you do reconnect with Gordon.   Please continue this story and do your own investigation and let us know the outcome.  Thank you. [end]
[start] im 23 now. this sounds so much like me. I dont know if life is worth living if this is what I have in store. [end]
[start] Thanks you...as a 19 years old who have still have yet to ask a girl out or to just approach one, this hurt me really hard. [end]
[start] This was so beautifully written, OP. I can tell it came from your heart, and your love for this man shines through. I am sure that he knew that you loved him, though perhaps not in the way that you would have meant it. I am sure he also thought back fondly on all the times you were together, and the all the times you made him smile.   &#x200B;  But, despite all of this, you shouldn't give up on yourself. Don't just wait for death and live on as you have been. Instead of waiting for death, live like you have never been alive before. Go and experience new things, meet new people. Take the leap. There are still risks and happiness and opportunities waiting for you out there. [end]
[start] I'm reading this like it'll be me in about 32 years it's so relatable. I moved from germany to the USA when I was 9 and never had the same social hooks I had back in germany because it took me a while to learn the language and afterwards I was too afraid of fucking up speaking because of my accent that people mocked so I pretty much only had friends in school and very very rarely would hang out with anyone outside of it. I'm now 33 and my best friend is someone I met on EverQuest in 1999 that lives across the country and I see him every few years. He has a wife and daughter now so I know a lot of this friendship is likely on borrowed time.  The fear of commitment has pretty much killed any desire for me to have a long term relationship.    Hope your life ends up in a better place where you feel happy. I am quite lonely myself and reading your story has made me a little and unhappily glad that there are definitely more like me out there. [end]
[start] I am crying, you are an amazing writer. [end]
[start] This story inspired me not sure what to do with the inspiration though ha. I have been in love with my best friend since we were kids. I cant tell him because im ugly but damn do I love him. He was recently deployed to Afghanistan imma write him a letter and tell him how much him being my friend means to me. Maybe one day ill come clean and tell him how I really feel about him. Also 65 isnt old you still have tons of life in you. My landlord is 73 years old and dates and goes to all kinds of events. I know what its like not to live and feel alone. Please dont give up thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] This dude’s story is the all too common price of society’s broken views of masculinity, and particularly of its homophobia. Homophobia creates a lifetime of self-oppression in gay people. You don’t hear much about it if you’re not gay because it’s not as catchy a tale as more overt forms of oppression, but it’s just as destructive none the less. [end]
[start] You are an amazing writer. If you could write a memoir in the form of a story about how it feels to be on the sideline, it would truly inspire a great deal of people.   There are many people like you. Young people, old people, but you all have something in common: a kind heart but no one to give it to.  Many of these people are afraid to speak up, but you did. This, right here, what you wrote, could be the start of something amazing. You just have to believe in yourself. Find a coffee shop, sit down in a social environment and write.   If, in a year or two, you are ready to share your story with the world, Reddit is an amazing platform on which one small story could blow up.  In the mean time, there are many things you could do to find a friend, such as volunteering for a cause you believe in as a person. Meeting people with the same passion as you is much easier. But remember, the first step is ALWAYS the hardest.   A dense comfort zone is hard to break, but there's strangers here on the internet that believe in you. Now it's time to believe in yourself. [end]
[start] I am about 2/3 of the way there and while we didn't have the same start, I'm worried that I might be well on my way to being alone for the next 20 years and I don't know how long after.  Strangely enough, there are a lot of similarities after childhood that you described that are eerily similar.  But I'll skip that part.  My family currently lives in Thailand and the mother and her two older children (that I adore and love as much as the two I have with her) can't get a Visa.  My choices are to use what I get from my compensation, knowing it will be enough to live there for at least a year, while hoping I can find a job to come back to after we hopefully get them Visas.  It is a big potential risk, but I know I will at least be happy since I will be with my family.  The other option is to stay here in the U.S. and be alone, but I could get a job and just send what I can which might actually be less than if I was there because of how expensive everything is here in the U.S. compared to there.  Especially when doing it alone.  I'm rambling...  Anyways, you helped me make a decision.  I don't want to be alone.  Especially since I found out last December that I have cancer.  Luckily it was caught very early so I have time before I need to start treatment, which would need to be done here in the U.S. Life put something wonderful in my path and I'm just trying to make it better but keep making it worse by staying away.  The money is better here, but I wind up spending it all on the bills I have here and sending what I can to make sure they have a good life there... still rambling.  Next cheapest ticket is on the 21st.  I think I know what I am going to do as long as I don't chicken out.  I'm going to take the risk and survive the struggle and be with my family that I love.  Thank you for this post, I have been struggling with this decision for a couple weeks.  Before I could hit save, she called me asking what I decided... I think everything might have just fallen in place.  Now to just hope those prices don't change between now and when I can get what I need to make sure I can have the ticket and enough to last the rest of the month until I get paid again. [end]
[start] I'm so truly sorry for your loss. It sounds like you've lost so much more than you realized that you had to lose, but you've gained from it, as well. This will probably get buried, but if you need someone or are lonely or even if you just think of something funny  you'd like to tell someone or an observation you've made, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you so much for sharing with us. [end]
[start] I printed this and plan to leave in the library whenever I go. You are changing lives. [end]
[start] I don’t know where you live or what your finances are like, but move...sell everything and move to Hawaii or some tropical place and get a job doing something that you think would be fun.    Don’t just sit around and be sad...go live... [end]
[start] Hey!  It ain't over yet, pal.  Get out there and live these next 20 years you got, because you do have about that much likely, if not more.  A lot can happen in 20 years.  I suggest you explore this side of yourself you've been too afraid to acknowledge, and one great way for you to do this is to check out Thailand.  There's no better place on earth for older men like yourself than Thailand.  I've met guys with stories very similar to your own in Thailand who were brought to life there.    Forget this dying quietly in your bed stuff; go do something because if you don't then you didn't really learn the lesson you profess to be teaching here. [end]
[start] Reading this made me think of [this music video](https://youtu.be/_IRhHDrgDpA). [end]
[start] I would read your book or memoir 100/100. [end]
[start] It really sounds like you have kept the secret of being gay all your life and I don’t want to be inappropriate but could this be why you have sheltered yourself for so long? The gay community is extremely welcoming and open for anyone who needs it and it isn’t too late for you to explore that side of yourself. It isn’t an ageist community and you’re never too old to meet a nice guy and have a relationship as deep or as shallow as you like. It doesn’t have to involve sex (as fun as it is!) and can just be about having a companion and somebody to do things with and plod through life with. You seem OK but it is clear you are missing something in life and you can fix that, even now. [end]
[start] holy fuck this spoke to me on a deep level [end]
[start] This is brutal :( thank you for reaching out to this community ❤ [end]
[start] I’m 38 years old and while my life so far has been pretty different from yours, I can’t help but notice a worrying pattern. I’m scared too. Scared that I’ll make mistakes, hurt people, embarrass myself. I’m an artist but I don’t think I’m very good despite decades of training. I worried so much about doing it “right” that all the joy was sucked out of it, my heart is not in it, and it shows.  I’ve had a rough life, and I have a lot of mental health problems, but I’m starting to realize, thanks to you, that I’m using them as a crutch to avoid the things I’m most afraid of. Not that my problems aren’t real — my panic attacks are very much real — but I avoid doing a lot of things because I tell myself they’ll make my condition worse, when really, they wouldn’t, and they probably can’t.  Oftentimes I find myself feeling that it’s too late, that I’m too old now to do the things that I want, that I’m trapped in this situation and there’s no way out.   You’ve just made me realize that I’m lying to myself. There’s nothing holding me back at all. Panic attacks come and go, and that’s the thing, they always go. They end. I can ride them out and carry on. They only last a few minutes.  I don’t know if you’ll read this, OP, but if you do, thank you. There’s still time. I’ve got time. I can do this. I need to log off and go back to the real world.   Thank you. For what it’s worth, I love you now, and I’ll always think of you. [end]
[start] You’ve lived 65 years without kids or a relationship. You’ve probably got some money saved up. Go travel the world or something. [end]
[start] I wish everyone who reads this and feels bad for this person realizes this is what pride month is about. This is what happens when being gay is something that you have to hide—it cripples you. We need to get to a place where people are free to “pursue happiness” and just go about their business like anyone else without fear of being shamed.  OP, you should watch “Beginnings,” a movie that came out about 10 years ago, partly about a man your age starting over (beginning a new life). [end]
[start] Hey man, I just want you to know that because this post has over 8k upvotes at the moment, you have made somewhat of an impact on at least 8,000 different people. That’s assuming that nobody forgot to upvote and that nobody downvoted and removed an upvote. On top of that, would wager to say that you have impacted a few of those 8,000 people even more than the rest. So you’ve done a lot of good making this post. Life experience is one of the greatest gifts you can offer someone. [end]
[start] I promise, old man. :')  I'm at a turning point in my life and in my career, maybe this was just advice I needed to free my anchors and start that new life overseas. [end]
[start] What a twist! [end]
[start] You have changed the way I see life in a way so loving I can’t quite explain, I’d love to have someone like you as a friend in my life genuinely, I have no friends and one like you would be absolutely more than enough. Thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] I am 23. And I am crazy about this guy who doesn’t know. I may just tell him... today. Truly moved by your story. Thank you for sharing ♥️ I hope you find peace and joy! [end]
[start] Yes continue to write, but please don't stop living. While acknowledging loss and time slipped past is hard use it as your fuel to move forward. You have had ups and  downs, you took a risk in being guarded. Your life is not over yet so don't get all deathbed confessional until it's your time. If you're shy, try Groupon, try tours, events, meetups. Volunteer at your library or a museum or an animal shelter. You lament the decades you've lost so why discard the decades you have left? [end]
[start] My mother is 80 years old. She's very religious and has always been afraid of just about everything. Wont fly, wont drive a car, only dated one man, my father but in there fifties they divorced. My father had a mental break and was never the same. He became violent and abusive so my mother left.  She lives alone and of her four adult children I'm really the only one who bothers with her. My sister a d her have t spoken in a decade. She has alway had a few friends but they're married and pretty busy. She spends most weekend alone.  She is desperately lonely but never does anything to change that. She has fallen for a married ma  at church who flirts with her every sunday. She's totally smitten and hes all she thinks about. They talk a lot but since he is married and she is super religious it can go nowhere.  I love my mother and have always been close but her and I are so different. I can't relate to her mindset of fear. She refuses to step out of her comfort zone even for a minute.  Your story reminds me of her a little. Sadly there are millions of older adults who are terribly lonely and I feel so much empathy those that are. I hope things change for you. I hope that maybe you will put yourself out there and try to be around people. Get involved with something.   You still have years ahead and how it unfolds is up to you.   Best wishes! [end]
[start] Thanks OP..... For 6 years I've been punishing myself over things that I did. Everyday I was thinking that the world would generally be better if I wasn't together with anyone. Until now I still don't think I'm ready but I hate myself to the core everyday that I know deep inside I still crave the comfort of having someone else beside me. Like you I don't wanna risk anything, I would only grab opportunities if they would present themselves to me. The thought of never achieving goals despite trying your hardest really scares me. Again thank you for at least reminding me that I'm not so alone even if it doesn't really work out for me in this lifetime. [end]
[start] im bookmarking thisss [end]
[start] Look... A post from my future self.  Your words were felt, friend. [end]
[start] Sounds like social anxiety. See a psychiatrist and get a pill. Worked wonders for me [end]
[start] You're amazing!!!! Life isn't over. You seem like a wonderful guy! 💕 best wishes to you! [end]
[start] Hey I don't think relationships define a person, I'm sure you have done worthwhile things in your life. I know you're lonely but that's not all that you are [end]
[start] This was absolutely beautiful and heartbreaking. OP! ITS NOT TOO LATE FOR YOU! 65 IS A GREAT AGE TO FIND LOVE & FRIENDSHIP! please don’t settle for this life of yours, you have an amazing soul that deserves so much! [end]
[start] I'm nobody to you, but thank you for being open and honest and sharing this. [end]
[start] Therapy would help you immensely. You seem to have low self-esteem, and other limiting beliefs.  My dad is in his 70s and still manages to keep himself busy and happy, even though the birds have left the nest. It’s about how you use the time you have NOW, and I would use it to take care of your own mental well-being.  Side note: if you can find someone that has access to magic mushrooms... they’ve been proven to help with your kind of mental rut. [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing your story, and you expressed it in such a vivid way aswell.  I thought I would share some point of view that I hope will brighten up your day a bit. Memorys is of the past, and our mind have the ability to take those memorys and project a future. Neither of these can no longer be real if we can enter the present moment. What is real is here. Now in this very moment. The present moment can be felt, and we all feel it from time to time but mostly in glimpses. Since our minds mostly runns the show..   It sounds like you have a very good compassioned heart, a bit covered up thats all. Sometimes we just need a little vacation from our mind and its storys we hear all day long in our head. Laugh is a good way to get a little lose if you want to express your self, and if you dont find anything funny at the moment try laughing at something random if you feel like, it could end up being funnier than you dared to think.. :-) You are soon to be 65 years old in your human body and mind, but the expression from your heart is always in the now, and this moment is all that there ever will be. We always are born into this now, new and fresh to feel and let go as the breath.  I just wanted to be clear with that what I expressed here is not meant to serve as a belief, and if anyone reading this feel this to be all wrong then I cant and wont argue with that. I read such a good quote yesterday that I like to end this post with, and it goes something like this as Im translating it..   "The truth can be tolerated only if you discovering it for youself" - Fritz Pearl [end]
[start] It may not seem significant to you but just by writing and telling your honest story, you have helped many, myself included. Thank you for your honest words. I hope you find the peace you are after. 🤝 [end]
[start] I am 26 but you described my life to a T. Everything about this feels so familiar, and the future so set. If you could go back to my age what would you do? [end]
[start] That was beautiful and heart wrenching. Your advice has been noted, I’m gonna do something wild today! Thank you for putting yourself out there. Look at you, taking risks 😉  If you ever feel so inclined, mention where you live and if anyone who has read this post is close to you, you can be damned sure anyone of us will get coffee or lunch with you (I’m in Colorado). And if it makes you too uncomfortable, all the more reason ❤️ You seem like a wonderful man. I hope to meet you one day soon. [end]
[start] Write a book! You’re clearly a great writer and have a way of conveying not just your emotions but advice as well. Write it all down! It could be your escape! Sell the book, go on tours telling your story. This could be a remarkable story that is only just getting started. Who cares about age. [end]
[start] I think this hurt my heart more than anything I have ever read on Reddit.  What a brave beautiful soul you are.  I dont know what to say, but I wanted you to know I read this.  I feel you.  I heard you.   My husband died on 6/14, just a couple of weeks ago and I cant help but feel the finality of that.  Its over.  There is nothing more in his life he can possible do, but your here!  You see what happens when you open up?  People respond.  Please! Just live.  Find something somewhere that brings you joy.  Take a cooking class or join the local gym. Take a course on writing and write a book. You have a talent with words.    Connect!  Its not to late.  I so desperately want you to be happy. [end]
[start] Omg what a post. Thank you so much for sharing this insightful, painfully honest story.   Sending you lots of love good sir!  Edit: at the airport right now crying in a corner.  It’s not too late! My mom found a gentleman friend when she was 61 y/o, after my dad passed. I hadn’t seen her that happy in years. It’s not too late my friend. [end]
[start] I always had a fear of this. Maybe it's time that I told her that I love her. [end]
[start] The last parts of your story is just beautiful...I felt like I truly learned a life lesson through your words. I hope even at 65 that you'll somehow find love. It's never too late to break out of your shell. I will take your words to heart and definitely live my life with no regrets and feelings of doubt. I hope you do too! [end]
[start] That's almost exactly how I felt before I realized I was gay. Even the part about not being able to perform with a woman. I'm not saying that this is your case, but when I finally realized that, most of the blanks in my life started to be filled. [end]
[start]  I'm from the USA and went to the Philippines when I was 47 and met a lady 26 . We now have 2 daughters 3 and 11 and I'm 59 now . Watch Anthony Bourdain's show about Manila . He says they are the happiest people on Earth.  English is a second language , there bilingual.  Everything is printed in English . Go there for vacation and I'm sure you will find people to connect with . Could easily start your own family . Don't worry women will approach you just go to the mall . I plan on retiring there soon .  Good luck ... [end]
[start] I hope you understand how with one message you accomplished what you never did. You opened yourself to us, thousands of strangers that are here only to listen to your story.   Someone said it already but you have a talent, you can write very well, you had my attention for your whole post, which is rather rare, you're just a stranger yet I felt a connection to your emotions.  Don't stop here, write a book, make a movie about Gordon. If you can't then find someone who will, even online if contact is your issue. Redeem yourself while you're still healthy and on this planet as you likely have decades to live. It is not too late, you'll be old when you'll want to.   Adopt a child, if you cannot then find a way to do it. The day you'll die you'll know that you weren't the coward you believe to be, but someone that fought for his friend until his last breath, even if his friend wasn't here to witness it.   Thank you so much for finally letting out your emotions with us, know that you've inspired me and numerous others, may they be 15, 20, 40, 60 or heck even 80 years old. This is only your first step, ride that momentum and never let it go. [end]
[start] I (24f) am at a point right now where this is my biggest fear, one close friend, no social life, drinking to let go and I even intend to start a career at sea... this has been a huge wakeup call to me and is so beautifully written I cried. Thank you for this. [end]
[start] I know what you mean to say...it is just two days back that i told the girl i have been in love with since 7 years that i do so....i had told her a few times before as well...she has a boyfriend and the last time we talked,i handled it not so good....so i decided to just let her know for the final time,that i still had feelings for her and probably always will...she said that i needed to move and she might marry her boyfriend in a year or two.....i felt bad but it was a thing i needed to just tell her one last time(hopefully)...... [end]
[start] Wow.. I usually never log into this and admit to being a ghost but wow this really describes where my life is going. I'm only 20 yet the introduction to your writing describes me. Everything from looks to relationships. Geez, I'm at a loss man. I'm not suicidal  and would never be, yet my life is going nowhere and I sit around with nothing to do, I get what you mean. I can tell you like to see good to others also. I find myself caught up in this problem, making a girls life great even though she doesn't give a fly. It's sad. I wish I had more or even someone to fill the void. I hope things take a turn for you bud, I hope they do for me too but for right now nothing seems like It will help and I'll be stuck in this solo adventure as a soulless blob the rest of my existence. It upsets me people go through this, and hurts more that I tried my best to fix these things but came to no avail. Lost a ton of weight and studied more, yet when I actually got the goals I wanted no-one seemed to appreciate it and I was still stuck in the hole I call life. I could type for hours and I'm sure you have this feeling too, but I'll stop here and go back to the same shit. I hope all gets well though man I really do [end]
[start] I just signed up for an account so I could reply to tell you that you shouldn’t be so hard on yourself, or so certain that you caused this to happen to your life.  Life’s not always so simple. Some people just get lucky and others don’t.  I’ve done many of the things you say you wish you’d done, yet I’m in almost exactly the same situation as you are. Meanwhile I know plenty of people who took the same hesitant approach to life as you did, yet somehow managed to get great lives.  Many people put in a lot of effort to have good lives, yet never succeed, while others put in zero effort, yet hit the lottery and have everything come to them.  I know plenty of people who are gorgeous, sexy, outgoing, social, friendly, successful, loyal and fun, yet have few, if any, friends and have been perpetually single. They do everything they can to meet people and get dates, yet for some reason nothing ever happens for them and they end up alone and are baffled by how it happened.  At the same time I know even more people who are awful, negative, miserable, angry, hateful, out-of-shape, unattractive, anti-social assholes who somehow have lots of friends, are married and have children.  Life just works that way, sometimes.  Over the years I’ve learned that the idea that life is what you make it is mostly a load of guff from people who got lucky and took credit for it. Effort doesn’t always equal success. It’s often just luck.  I’ve busted my ass to succeed, yet all of my greatest successes were due to happenstance.  I’ve had years where I’ve worked hard to reach my goals, yet made no progress, and other years where I’ve done nothing but get high and avoid life, yet great success and love fell in my lap.  That's what keeps me going – the knowledge of life’s unpredictability. Having control over your life is mostly an illusion that we all eventually have to face. That truth can either be empowering or debilitating.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying you shouldn’t take steps forwards, because making effort towards a goal is one of the oldest ways to find purpose in life and to avoid existential dread. That's why so many people who pack their lives with activity are the same ones who plummet when they have to spend time alone with themselves.  But don't assume that your effort will result in success, or that your lack of effort will result in failure. It's the action to keep the mind busy that is valuable. The success will either happen, or it won't.  What I *am* saying, though, is that kicking yourself when you're down for things that maybe weren’t your fault is a surefire way to make things even worse in the meantime. It may not be your fault, at all.  Life is painful, but meaning can be found in that pain. That's the lesson everyone ends up learning, one way or another, whether it's early in life or late. The sooner you learn it, the easier life becomes. [end]
[start] Do you still drink at all? Are yoy a calm drunk? Do you live in NJ?  You're quite a bit older so these may go over your head but... Do you touch any video games? Do you ever play dungeons and dragons in person or through a webcam video chat?  Even if its hard to meet up in person, those are some nice alternatives to make and meet friends you cherish. I'd love to invite you to one of those things if you've got an hour to blow one day. [end]
[start] RemindMe! 7 days [end]
[start] Was about to turn my phone off and go to sleep when I saw this post, and I'm glad that I did. I was more or less going on the similar lines and I've been lying to myself that it's because I want to put all my focus on my career right now (I'm 22), but everyday I end up feeling lonely and have no one to share anything with. And the part where you said that you feel alive only when you're drunk, really resonated with me.  As much as I am sorry for the way how you feel right now, I thank you a ton for telling me that I need a course correction in my life. I'm gonna make some mistakes, get some bruises and hopefully change the way how I've been feeling about life.  Thank you so much, kind stranger. Also, I might sound naive, but please don't embrace defeat. There's a reason why you're still healthy and don't have any pressing health concerns. You're meant to have a great time before your time comes and I hope you find the courage & luck to turn it around. [end]
[start] Logged in to just upvote this. Amazing. [end]
[start] Mate I really feel for you, it’s a heartbreaking thing to read. I’m 34 and only in recent years have learnt what loneliness is. How painful it gets. I’ve been partying for all of my teen and young adult years, super popular, missed out developing deeper connections with a lot of acquaintances I partied with that I now sorely regret. I’ve had some strange spiritual experiences that have put me in the looney territory with everyone I know. My social life is a shadow of what it was.   Why I’m telling you this is because I’d like you to understand that it doesn’t matter you didn’t have a super busy social life in your earlier years. I have and now I’m still in exactly the same state as you. Don’t lose any sleep over the past, there’s nothing you can do about it except accept it and forgive yourself unconditionally.   You’re not too old to change things up. My uncle is 67, a massive loner, more so than you seem to be, but he still makes the effort to go to senior dinners and singles mixers. There are many agencies who organise this and there are many seniors who are as lonely as you and me. Male or female you can find people who are in the same boat as you. Don’t think your situation is worse than average, in fact it is average, ie normal and perfectly manageable.   Please consider what I’m about to type seriously. There are many agencies, websites and apps for meeting people who are lonely and gasping to connect. Start thinking you can make your golden years be the best part of your life. It’s perfectly doable. EVERYONE there is in the same boat as you, don’t think you’re any worse or better than the people you meet. Don’t overthink how you’re coming across - this is crucially important. If you don’t entertain these thoughts at all you’ll be MUCH more casual and it will allow you to show your actual personality. No self conscious bullshit, it’s as easy as making the effort not to cultivate those thoughts. Forgive yourself unconditionally for doing that before and say goodbye to those thoughts by not expecting yourself to be perfect. The secret I can tell you is that super confident people make all the same self conscious gags as everyone else but they are much more forgiving to themselves and don’t allow these events to mess with their own self image.   Please don’t think you’re too old to change. You may easily have another 20-30 years and these could be the best years of your life. Make the effort to connect to other seniors. I wish you all the best! [end]
[start] I love you man. Thank you for writing this. I was feeling pretty depressed today and this really helped. It’s reminded me of the power of honesty and sincerity. You showed courage in writing this. You did it beautifully. Be proud of yourself for at least realizing and acknowledging all of this. [end]
[start] Your life isn’t over, nor is it wasted. You single handedly inspired thousands of people with this one post. To me, the meaning of life is to give others lives meaning, and you have done so much of that right here. I’m 16 going on 17 this month, I really appreciate this post. I want to go into music, and I have been convinced since Tom Petty died that it doesn’t matter whether I won or lose this leap, I’ll be happy. I still believe it and I don’t think there is any way I could be unhappy playing music. But even still there are times where I want to hold my breath because I know there is no going back, I’m too committed, but I don’t think I’m good enough, I have another reason to just go for it now.   Thank you. If you need someone to talk to, I love talking to people about life. There is so much to learn from people about life, if there is anything we will never know enough about, it’s life, and the pursuit of kindness. You sound like a lovely man, Don’t give up.  Maybe it’s time to take a leap. Go to a festival or concerts and start talking to people, music is a great bond for people. Every concert I’ve been to, everyone was lovely. We just went to ELO and man everyone just had so much love. Neil Young’s shows are the same way. Bob Segers, really any classics. I’m not sure about newer music, it’s not my fancy, but I’m sure it’s just as nice. Something about music just brings out the best in people.  Sending lots of peace and love your way! Don’t give up now, 65 isn’t old, you still have a life ahead of you. You’d be a great public speaker or if you don’t like speaking, writer. Public speaking is huge in spreading a message. ❤️ [end]
[start] Thank you so much for sharing and I can’t imagine how brave that was to look back and realized you could have done more and coming here to write about it. But may I say, you’re not dead- not yet. Go make some mistakes, live and enjoy the time you do have left. It’s only the end and a life full of only regrets, if you do nothing. Go explore the world, go meet some sweet young thing that reminds you of your friend and enjoy it. You’re making the mistake of thinking that it’s too late. Maybe your soulmate is just waiting- maybe they are 60, 69 or 30 years old- you don’t know. You have the opportunity to do something, you have the ability to look back and see what you could have done differently - now do it.   Maybe you have another 30 years left, what are you going to do with it? Regret the first 72 yrs and 88 yrs? Go out there and give no fucks, explore this wide beautiful world, fall on your face, be embarrassed (people have such short memories about anyone but themselves) and finally- go fall in love with yourself cause why not?  Wishing you a rebirth with lots of thrills and no regrets for having done shit you wanted to do. It’s not over, your story is still being written and how it ends is yet to be decided- you can either let your fears write or you can take that damn pen. [end]
[start] I find your story very similar to mine. This is my fear. Years of being alone in a very controlled life makes it harder and harder every year to break out of the routine.   Thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] Like, man... I rarely comment but.. fuck. This got me feeling some type of way.... [end]
[start] I am sorry to hear that you regret your choices, but you have to trust that it will be for the good of something. There is always something good!   Think of how you can turn this into something positive. Maybe you want to support an organization that helps people making contacts? Or that helps people getting in touch with their emotions?  What can you do to ‘make up’ for it? I think this post you created was just a starting point. There is some energy in you that you should set free ❤️ [end]
[start] Ah I’m crying right now... This is so touching and inspirational... I think imma start taking more risks because I’m also shy and I’m too nervous to do a lot of things I want to do😭🙏🏼 yolo [end]
[start] I know you probably won’t get this message, but you’ve inspired me to go on an adventure. I’m not going to Europe but I’m ready to see what the world around me has to offer.   Thank you. [end]
[start] Wow.. thanks for those words [end]
[start] Thank you man for the job what have done with your words, you make me feel what I have going through thanks allot for that awaken me. [end]
[start] Wow! A 50 year old Virgin and never previously married. That's amazing. Wow. You sound like a really great guy. You are an awesome person,with great values. I'm so amazed! And you are a WONDERFUL writer! [end]
[start] Time to start operation "Find Gordon"   Also you should consider writing a book or something, this read as a "Russian Memoir". [end]
[start] Do some lsd [end]
[start] This is a beautifully crafted piece of fiction. Do you have any novels or blogs you would like to promote? [end]
[start] I could 100 % see this story being my story. And I'm sitting here crying thinking that I don't want it to be. [end]
[start] Crying as I read this because I feel like this is me in 30 years. I'm sorry and I wish I could bring your friend back. [end]
[start] Boohoo you put yourself in this situation you should have grown a pair years ago [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing your story. I hope that you will allow your friend's life, and your love for him, to inspire you to grow and change and be the person you always wanted to be. Life is too short. Take a risk. The worst thing that could happen is that you'll die, and it doesn't seem like you mind that thought. Find out who you are, live your life, there's still so many years! Find a therapist or a support group for men. Don't give up on yourself - you have  a heart and a soul, use them :)     \~With love, peace, and hope for your happiness\~ [end]
[start] This is the reason why I have lived my life beyond the fullest with zero regrets. I do not want to be on my deathbed wishing that I’ve done _______. Live is meant to be lived and not just exist. [end]
[start] This is a heart wrenching, yet beautiful story.  Thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] You cant change the past no matter how much it hurts. But you are talking as if that's it now you have wasted your life and thats that? Think logically here, if nothing changes then in 10 years time you will be saying the exact same thing. Life is a continuous wheel. It stops for no man. Yes you have regrets, yes that absolutely sucks but don't give yourself even more! Start living now it's never ever too late! Get a hobby, read, go to adult social clubs, single cruises. There are so many things you can do with your life. You have made the mistake of not living already don't do it again. Learning from your mistakes is the light at the end of the tunnel. [end]
[start] For what it's worth, you're not alone. We're here, reading your words, connecting with what's in your heart. It may not be much, but it's more than nothing. Thank you for sharing. I'm 35 and have just been gradually giving up on everything. My thought process, whenever something hurts me, is to simply say "well, there's nothing I can't simply walk away from and be done with." This gives me something to think about. [end]
[start] 18 here, extremely lonely. Surrounded by people but nobody knows me and neither i them. I fear this will be me. But i hope to make and effort. Also as everyone has pointed out. U write really well. U should heavily consider write a memoir of a short book of some sort. U could title it "to Gordon" or something. I would love to know more about the life u led. Maybe find something there i can use for myself. [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing this. There isn’t much that I can say that someone else hasn’t said, but if you need a friend or someone to chat with, I’m absolutely down. I don’t doubt for a second that there are so many things that I, a 25 year old man, can learn from you. You’re still a young buck though.  You have time to do whatever you want. It also seems like you already know how to turn everything around. You can still make beautiful memories with people and by yourself. Good luck out there. [end]
[start] This is exactly me, lucky I am young, never try to reach another soul, moved to another country, live lonely. I am glad I can enjoy this loneliness, but I do notice this is not healthy. [end]
[start] I am a person who would love to be friends with you. If you answer I will reply back and possibly give you my email [end]
[start] Hey man, I’m 22 and this is how I often feel when I try to peer into the future. Since you’re much older what advice would you give someone who has a hard time socially to maybe open up more and become more outgoing. Also, I’m down to msg and have conversations with you daily. I don’t mind lending a hand and being a friend. Feel free to reply or msg me. Godspeed buddy! [end]
[start] I’m so sorry and sad for you.  There is time to learn from this realization and change if you think you might want to.  And it’s understandable if you don’t. [end]
[start] This hit me so hard. I have anxiety about exactly growing old beeing a bystander in my own life and only ending up with regret.  Thank you for this very honest post.  Hope you find a slice of happiness somewhere down the road. [end]
[start] You still have time to be kind to people. No matter how grey the color palette of your life is, you can always put a smile on someone else's face. If you cannot live for yourself, live for others.  That is advice from an immature young adult. Take it, build on it, change it, leave it. I hope it brings you some form of peace or closure.   Love to you my friend x [end]
[start] Heavy. Thank you for posting this, it’s a valuable lesson on the importance of talking charge of my life. [end]
[start] At 25 I have enough cringe worthy things to look back on. I'm blessed to have grown up in a time where the narrative is to fail faster and more often. [end]
[start] Never to late to take another chance. Go for it. Learn a trade. Engage. [end]
[start] Are you gay? [end]
[start] You should take up drawing/painting, or a new instrument. Get a personal trainer to build a better body, confidence, and you’re forced to interact with someone [end]
[start] You’re a great writer mate and this is so beautifully written yet haunting at the same time. Your post really resonates with me and I’m only twenty so I will take heed of your warning [end]
[start] I’m going through a lot of shit rn.. a choice that I made that’s causing me so much pain, but also happiness. A lot of times i wonder why I deserve to struggle like this.. but after reading your post, it hit me deeper that life is all about learning and growing. And it made me realize that I need this experience to be a better person.  I’m sorry I have nothing comforting to say, but I want to thank you for sharing your experience as I’m in a very dark place rn, and you helped shed a little bit of light. Thank you. [end]
[start]  What you wrote reminded me of a really good movie, Withnail and I. I really can't explain why and what are the connections between your story and the movie, but if you never saw it you should give it a try. [end]
[start] I’m 19 and i’m just  starting to take risks. I hope you live a good life. It’s never too late to be happy. [end]
[start] A. E. Housman: “because I liked you better”. Look it up. Beautiful poem that will likely resonate with you. [end]
[start] Thanks for this. I hope you can find some happiness in the time you still have. [end]
[start] This was very moving. So much of this hit me close to home. Thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] Yeah, it's really important to invest in yourself because I used to be like you socially awkward to a greater degree than I am today, insecure due to obesity and generally not taking care of my appearance, had 1 or 2 friends, ate lunch alone, but then I was like I need to change my life so I started working out, taking care of myself through a healthy diet, skincare, and other TLC stuff, and I started dressing nicer as well as going to therapist and psychologist and just getting myself out there as much as I can because you have to at least give yourself a fighting chance to change your life around and things have honestly been going very well. I am happy with my body, I hang out with plenty of friend on a daily basis, girls approach me and I can speak to them without issues, and I have never help better physically, mentally, and psychology. We as humans need healthy social relationships to be happy. [end]
[start] Man i feel you so bad. I'm 39 and i'am in the same situation. I got 2 or 3 relationship in my life, most never last really long. Im single for the last 10 years. I used to have that couple of friends like you. He was a very nice friends so does she. But i fell in love with her. So i decided it was better to split up. They are still together, and im still alone. I plug my self with video game online to make my free time less difficult. But i feel like i'am wasting my life. I still feel sooooo lonely. No one ever call me to go out somewhere, not even my own familly. I have a real hard time bounding with other people but i would love it soooo bad. I dont know what to do. I dont want to die at 70, 75, 80ish and at my last breath regretting my life. Its what im the most scare... [end]
[start] I usually don’t take the time to read really lengthy post but I had to read yours and I’m glad I did I’m srry you had those experiences I wish i could just hug you for a long time you might not even want me to but I’d still want to do it like a very long time [end]
[start] Can you tell us about how you came to be married? [end]
[start] So this is my future is it because it's much the same for me 25 male only people I talk to on a ny regular basis is my friend and his gf ( which after threatening to leave him because he let his cousin stay over till she could make arrangements to get out of town and away from her psycho, tweaking, woman beating ex I'm wondering how much he is really worth for her to make that threat). I cant read women at all.  I only loved one girl but no matter how hard I tried in the 8 year long on again off again hell that was our relationship anytime we would get closer she would flip this switch and just decide to do something completely fucked up to end it. The only person to ever tell me they loved me in any romantic sense was this girl I though saw me as just a friend but she waited until she was already in 7 year long relationship to tell me while her bf was passed out drunk no less. As much as I wish I could have had a more in depth conversation about it because she is an amazing girl it just felt wrong like cheating I could only think could I really take joy for myself if it means stripping it from someone else.  Though it makes me think back to all the times she hugged me and for the first time I came to realize the difference between being hugged and being held. To this day I dont know if I did the right thing god knows i wish it could have been different that I wasn't so blind I suppose I never thought that anyone loving me without cause or provocation was a possibility.  I only had sex once it was an emotional reaction to a bad breakup where I had this realization.  That every time I get further intimately with someone and have a new experience it seems to give them power over me this ability to cause pain in ways that I am not accustomed to so I just kind of lost it to a random girl at a going away party being thrown for me( marines) but that was about 4 years ago. I suppose my outlook on love can be summarized with two sentences. Love is the greatest form of power. Power exists to be abused. [end]
[start] Thank you so much for writing this. Im young but feels like life is going by so fast. I always feel lost and lonely and afraid to try after failing. This post just reminded me to not give up and go for it. We don't know each other but know that you made a positive in my life. [end]
[start] You're not too old to try now. [end]
[start] If you're into the idea of having a penpal, please let me know! [end]
[start] May I ask what country you live in? [end]
[start] Admittedly, this reminds me way too much of myself. Thank you, stranger, for the warning. [end]
[start] I would be honored to get to know you. I need a friend just like you. [end]
[start] Thank you. I’m so sorry you lost your beloved friend. I saw you saying you were thinking of travelling and going to the Netherlands. I went there about 9 years ago and it’s still one of the most beautiful countries I’ve ever visited and I want to go back. I hope you go and travel more and do things that give you contentment in your life. Thank you for looking out for those of us who are younger and struggling too. [end]
[start] you made me cry because that's the future I see for myself [end]
[start] Thank you for posting this. I needed to have someone tell me what you just did. [end]
[start] You write so well. I hope you can find peace. [end]
[start] Thank you for this. I hope you explore and find something new are your friends ceremony. Enjoy! [end]
[start] Meh, people with a family and success are miserable too. Death and misery are the way of all life, always have been. [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing.  Please don't forget that the now-moment has a lot of power. 65 yrs old is still early. Do something now to make it the life that you say you have avoided. Think about it this way: If things don't work out, then you are alone anyway. All upside from here, in my opinion. It is never too late. You may find a soul who will love every cell that makes you you.  We are all one and the same. Show love and you will receive love.  Best of luck! [end]
[start] You’re 65! You could conceivably live another 20 or 30 years. Get put there. Be the person you want to be, the only person holding you back is you. Join a club, try something you’ve never tried, BE BRAVE! I bet in the end the only regret you’ll have is not trying! [end]
[start] Wow, dude. Big read, here. Thank for for your words/and writings. [end]
[start] I hope you find things you enjoy, and live the rest of your life on your terms. I feel your pain in a lot of ways, I’m 30, my few close friends from college are slowly drifting apart and becoming further absorbed in thier own lives. I even feel now how hard it is to make friends, a lot of my time is consumed by work and general life stuff, basically survival. I’m lucky to have a wonderful partner, but of anything ever happened to him I would most likely end up like you.   I want to know, do you regret not having kids? I know that’s a very pointed question, and if you don’t want to answer that, I understand. I’m asking because I am grappling with that question right now. I’m a 30 year old female, and just cannot fathom fitting in having kids into my life in the near future. I still can barely take care of myself financially, and am working towards a lot of things career-wise, including changing professions entirely. I just don’t forsee being able to fit having kids in my plans for a long time, and by then it might not be possible. I am at the point where I feel like I have to choose a career or kids because it took me a long time to find a profession I’m passionate about. Most of me doesn’t mind having kids, but I do worry when I’m much older I will end up feeling lonely or will be lacking a support system.   Again, I know that’s a rough question so if you aren’t comfortable with it, that’s okay.  I wish you all the best, and am sending you sincere love. There’s so many people like you, myself included. I truly hope you are able to make the most of everything.   If you ever need a friend, feel free to message me. [end]
[start] I turned 20 on the 11th last month and I can honestly say I’m on this path. I’ve lost contact with all my friends from HS, haven’t talked to my HS best friend in over a year, I could count my friends on less than one hand. I’ve never been one to trust people, my only best friend talked horribly about me behind my back and tried to prevent me from dating my bf. My bf is the only thing leading me astray from a life of solitude. His love keeps me going and makes me want to be something.   I think I needed to read this today. Thank you for sharing your story. I hope you find a way to move past your regrets and enjoy the rest of your life doing whatever makes you happy.   Look at this way.. you may have spent up until now living in loneliness, but maybe finally realizing these emotions are real is what it takes for you to change the course of the next 20 or so years. It is *never* too late to make your life what you want it to be. I’m sending you lots of love right now friend. [end]
[start] I’m incredibly moved by your journey and wish you well. [end]
[start] Dam I needed this. Im 25 and have already wasted so much of my life doing nothing but playing video games. Ive wasted so much time I feel like theres no point in even trying anymore. Maybe I should give life another chance. [end]
[start] I’m 23 and you just summarized how I feel now and picture myself when I’m your age. I just dont know how to change. [end]
[start] You are 65 in good health! You are still SO so young!! Please start taking risks and you’re life will blossom more than you know it. My aunt is 76 and probably soon to be widow with no children but I have no doubt in my mind she will not die alone. ❤️ [end]
[start] it's never too late to change, anxiety and depression are very treatable mental health conditions in today's world. you aren't in bad health or suicidal so i think you still have things to look forward to in life even with your regrets and bad experiences [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing your story, I have a practical suggestion to help with meeting people, ballroom or salsa group dance classes where people change partners every few minutes. It's all ages, easy to learn the beginners steps, allows you to socialise with people in a structured safe environment. It has done wonders for my social life, provides me with physical fun activity and killed dead most of my social anxiety. Please consider it. [end]
[start] This will be me in a few decades. I'm just too much of a coward to meet people. [end]
[start] I wish you well and hope you take a chance on yourself! I think once you open yourself up to new experiences, you’ll get comfortable with doing it more often. It’s never too late to be happy! [end]
[start] Why don't you push yourself to live a better, more fulfilling ending? just make wildly different choices. Get a pet, go to a pub on Karaoke night and sing a song, take a dance lesson, go to church and try to find God. Join a charity and try to help some people around you. The world is your oyster and you have nothing to lose. [end]
[start] I'm so sorry man. I hope the best for you.  You can talk with me if want. Message me. :)  We can try to be friends [end]
[start] We are your friends! [end]
[start] I feel like I'm going down the same path, at least in some ways, but I don't know how to stop. [end]
[start] Its never too late to start new. This is heartbreaking and beautiful as mentioned above. I wish you happiness and joy on your time here on Earth.  I like to think of death as a transformation. There's got to be more to us. Somehow, somewhere. At least that's my hope :) [end]
[start] Hey brother, its never too late to make the best of what you have left... I think you already know that. I hope you believe and act upon it too. [end]
[start] I'm 27 and really don't give a damn about being social. No fears, but also no drive, and I would never have kids in a world like this. Looks like you're my future, though my life has been kinda interesting and I won't be lonely. Just alone. [end]
[start] Wow I needed to read this. Thank you so much for sharing.   I started therapy not too long ago, when my therapist mentioned interpersonal relationships, she could immediately tell it was a painful subject for me. All my life, I was longing for connections but something always got in the way, so I felt terribly lonely. My family moved a lot, so never stayed long enough in one place to make lifelong friends. Grew up super independent because I had no siblings either. When I got older, I think every time things got a little inconvenient for me, I just moved as if it was a reset button.  I always envied people who have a great circle of friends they've known since high school because I feel like all my friendships/relationships are so temporary. I started to realize that I see myself as a burden on people, never reached out, always waited for other people to make the first move. And in the back of my mind, there's an anxiety of saying or doing the wrong thing that will cause people to walk away from me. It's a work in progress. I have to start taking risks, opening up and being more vulnerable.   For what it's worth, it's never too late. I hope you feel inspired by all the support in this thread to live your life differently from now on, with zero regrets. Gordon would be proud. [end]
[start] This is such a heartfelt, moving, and moving post. Thanks for the tremendous honesty and thoughtfulness. I actually made two art pieces that you might enjoy/find relevant that I published last year on my 27th birthday.  [LIFE (warning: nudity)](https://vimeo.com/305675379)   [DEATH](https://vimeo.com/305891211)   I hope they echo some truth about the desperation of existence for some y’all here. Best. [end]
[start] You're not dead yet. Face your fears no matter how terrifying they are. [end]
[start] OMG dude, congrats on coming out! Now move to Toronto, there's a massive and loving community here that will completely transform your life. Seriously. It's summer time. Buy a plane ticket, rent an Air BnB for several weeeks, and head straight to [The 519 Centre](http://www.the519.org/) and just say hi and let everyone know where you are at. [end]
[start] This was incredibly powerful; thank you for sharing!   You’re 64 - that doesn’t mean life’s over. There’s still a lot you can do! 😇 [end]
[start] I want to let you know that no human should ever be alone. Now you have a choice to be alone or talk to a stranger miles away (maybe) if you choose to. Feel free to message me anytime you want to. Ive met a few people on here, some I still don't know their name, but my inbox is always open to you, bow you have a choice. I'm 38 and I spent 20 years in addiction, a few of those homeless and battled cancer on and off so what you had to say stuck with me. And don't ever worry about being shy or bothering me, after the crazy 38 years I've lived. You are welcome to message me, don't ever be alone again. [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing this.  Not sure where you are located, would love to have a beer or drink with you.    It took many years to open up to my friends and let them know that I love and appreciate them. [end]
[start] This honestly just makes me feel like suicide is a viable option since I too don't have any friends, family, or loved ones.  Would rather than than spend another 40 years living the way I am now.  I mean, what would it matter?  I have nothing to contribute, I'm more of a drain than a gain.  If anything I did were to ever matter it'd probably be in a bad way.  Every employer I've ever had has treated me like absolute shit.  My parents treated me like absolute shit.  Every love interest in the end treated me like absolute shit.  To think.  Another 40 years of this absolute shit.  Just seems like a bad joke that needs to end sooner than later... [end]
[start] I'm in my 60s and the complete opposite of u.... At 62 I still feel like I'm in my 20s, I've been married 3 times the last one was 20 yrs younger and gave her 2 great boys, I had 4 with my first wife.. but even with all that in my life I still get lonely... My older kids have their own kids now and my younger kids live with there mother.. I'm staying with my first wife till I save up enough money to buy a nice box truck or a large van to build out and live in... U should think about doing that get out there talk to people meet new people don't worry about what people think, it's time u get out there 65 is not the end it could be a new beginning for u... Let me know if u need a friend to get out there with... I'll make sure ur next 20 years are way better then ur last 60 years... Let me know.... [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing kind  soul [end]
[start] Thank you for the warning. Some of us needed to hear this now, cause you may have just saved our future. I hope you do get to see your friend again someday. Y’all have some catching up to do [end]
[start] Sounds like you've had more friends and social interactions than many of us, quite frankly. [end]
[start] The future is now old man [end]
[start] This brought tears to my eyes. Have you thought about anything you would like to do with your life? Maybe go on a trip somewhere or learn to play an instrument? You are still **able**, it isn't too late to start living. [end]
[start] 😭 [end]
[start] There is no need to blame yourself for the life you got. Probably your family was very demanding of you when you were little, they never told you making mistakes is okay and that everyone does it. You probably grew up thinking that mistakes are bad, and the reason is the way you were raised.  Good thing is that you can still work on this problem as you acknowledge it. It’s never late to start a new life and I hope you will do a lot better from now on! [end]
[start] I recently heard a story on the Moth radio about an older gay man who never thought he would find love again, but did in an unexpected way:   [https://themoth.org/storytellers/charles-fatone](https://themoth.org/storytellers/charles-fatone)   It's really well told and your story made me think of it. Basically, anything can happen at any stage of life if you put yourself out there even a little bit.   &#x200B;  To me, somehow the worst part about being an introvert is not the lack of companionship, but the angst and shame you feel from being a "loner"... That is, the existential feeling that you are alone is worse than the actual loneliness. You can still enjoy life by yourself (thanks, Keanu!). Whatever you decide for yourself, don't let that feeling dominate your life! [end]
[start] Ehug. [end]
[start] I see a lot of myself in your post. Thank you for sharing your story and god bless you ❤️ I hope that you find peace, you never know what the future will bring [end]
[start] Hugs. Makes me feel better about the spazzy crazy life I’ve lived. Big hugs. You made me cry.  I’m kinda alone in my own way. [end]
[start] If you're ever in North Idaho, I'd love to have a beer with you. [end]
[start] This hit me like a truck. [end]
[start] You should find a buddy on Grindr. [end]

[start] Probably not looking for any advice or "you should..." and this thread has blown up so your inbox is probably overflowing....   But you need to be living in a cohousing community!  Read about it if you aren't familiar with the concept.  It is intentional community, aging in place, and building community based on deeper personal connection with one's neighbors.  Not a religious or ideologic thing at all.  It's a Scandanavian concept that is growing rapidly in North America.  PM me if you like, I know a lot about it as I'm a member of one.  With any luck there is a group forming or existing in your area.  It changes your life.  I'm kinda like you but a bit younger and a bit more outgoing.  Cohousing definitely changed me and I'm grateful for it every day. [end]
[start] holy fuck op read the whole thing i  needed this [end]
[start] Where do u live?? wanna grab a beer mate? [end]
[start] Interesting story. You speak like an adopted person. Anyway.  Thanks for sharing your story. Question is, what do you want to see when you look back 20 years from now? Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Sounds like you've nothing to lose, so just go ahead, give it a try, and see if you enjoy it! [end]
[start] Ill do anything I can to help. No one should feel this way. I empathize with you [end]
[start] Ey broski i really liked reading your story. Its really helped show me that i just gotta bite the bullet and put myself out there again.   I wish you the best on your endeavors. [end]
[start] 19 here. Looks like I'll have the same fate [end]
[start] If you wanna share some nachos sometime, let me know [end]
[start] I'm sure others have said similair things to this, but with this realization you should realize that it's not too late to change. Every year offers an infinite number of opportunities and you can make whatever you want of it. Put yourself out there and you can still experience the best years of your life. Do something wild. I'm young but I've always found getting out in the world and out in your comfort zone can do incredible things for your social life and confidence. Don't give up until your last breath. [end]
[start] No more regrets. Don’t wait on death. Get up tomorrow and take some risks. Sober. Make mistakes. Laugh and embrace your true self. For your friend. Thank you for telling your story. You realize all it would take is one day,or one hour, of finally feeling free to make all that time and all your heart ache vanish. Best wishes. [end]
[start] Reddit is here for you if you would like friends. It is not too late. We are real people behind these computer screens :) Thank you so much for sharing your story. [end]
[start] You still have many good years left. It isn't too late to find out who you truly are and what you're really worth to someone. [end]
[start] I'm 31 and used to be terrified of making mistakes, or "failing". I realized that failing is the natural order of things; the first and necessary step to success.   Make it your goal to get stuff wrong, and you will get some stuff right by chance.  Don't mean to proselytise. Rejigging "failure" to mean success in my brain has been helpful. [end]
[start] I....cant....I dont even know [end]
[start] Thank you for your advice. Your honesty and self awareness are truly inspiring. I want to let you know that the grief you feel will pass. Love will come into your life again, that much, I promise. [end]
[start] OP, you’re only 65. There is so much time to live the life you want to lead. Don’t give up yet! [end]
[start] Good advice I agree with most of that , however some advice for someone in your stage in life ,you should try meditation and find fulfillment with these years left on Earth , everyone deserves these states in life and it's never too late I wouldn't let them slip away. [end]
[start] This is one of the most beautiful things I've ever read and I can't say for certain, but like many others I relate to it deeply and don't think I'll ever forget it, and as such, maybe it will change or impact my life in the future, so thank you, either for that or just for posting an uncommon story for those with a similar one. I won't say I hope things get better because I think that would be missing the point, but rather I truly hope that you find closure. [end]
[start] What part of the country so you live in? There are subreddits for pretty much every mid-sized and large city. I've made a lot of friends through my local. [end]
[start] Make use of each day you have left and focus on appreciating very small good things. Also, I would consider getting some help or counselling. A lot of people 65+ deal with depression and anxiety. [end]
[start] Man, you’ve gotten this far and you have plenty of time left. I’m sure writing this out was very therapeutic. I think that talking to someone, a therapist, would be hugely beneficial.   However, might I suggest one Hail Mary: go to a “legal area” and do some “magic mushrooms” if you catch my drift. They can change your life completely and challenge your psyche. You may just finally blossom into the social butterfly that has been inside you all along.   You got this, now get after it. [end]
[start] I’ll be your friend, it’s never to late to make changes. [end]
[start] Dude, you’re 65 but still healthy.  Just get up tomorrow and be someone different.  Buy clothes that are a different color than what you wear. Go try something you haven’t done before.  What do you have to lose?  You said you’re ready for death, so just have fun with the time you have left. [end]
[start] Please do not grow old and let the years pass by uneventfully. Don't wait for golden years to arrive without effort, without risk, without ups and downs and struggles. I tried so hard to avoid struggles out of that crippling fear and anxiety I always felt, and it got me nowhere.     You heard that bois from r/meirl ?   you can keep memeing but you need to do something to be happy.    I am not ure if the post is legit but in ase it is, thnk you for your words [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing this [end]
[start] I'm gonna be honest, and I'll probably get a lot of hate. But I don't mind it.   You think / thought very highly of your friend. You mention his wife not necessarily living up to what he deserved (that's 100% OK, it happens). But you have a lot of reservation for him.   I'm gonna say it.. and I could be 100% wrong.. it's ok.   Maybe your retraction from others is a symptom of your own confidence in who you are?   I thoroughly enjoy being alone as well. But it seems that you situation is rooted deeper. I wouldn't say depressed, but comfortably numb. You mention not being suicidal, so that tells me you have some level above average in mental health.   Not sure where I'm going with this, but your good man. Not every life you live is perfect, but you at least actively contributed to something positive in another's life.   Regardless of your own regrets, you did good. Be happy, be you, enjoy the rest of what you have left. [end]
[start] Go to meetup.com There's something for everyone. Learn a language, learn about wine or beer or music or bike riding or mountain climbing. Honestly...lots of people in your shoes, you just don't see them...like we can't see you. You have your whole life ahead of you. Sounds like your financially independent.  When I was transferred to a new city, I went to meetup for learning Spanish, German, French. It was fun to learn another language and teach at the same time. I respect your regrets...but I have two children and married for 25 years with regrets. Don't look back at what you haven't done, you bring a lifetime of experience that is needed by someone or a group of people. My experience is stop looking inside yourself, volunteer at the Ronald McDonald house, hospital, local VA, dog pound, public radio, symphony, art museum or inner city school. Stop regretting...start living. I believe you can do it! [end]
[start] This is a beautiful story. Even if you have regrets this far in life, you still have much to experience.  You share a good lesson, but also know it's not too late. [end]
[start] As many other have said, you're life is not over till it's over, so go out and live it! Take a little risk, then a little more. What do you have to lose? Live it up! [end]
[start] That was beautiful.  I am sorry for the loss of your friend.  Thank you for your insights.  You're an amazing writer.  Please continue to share your wisdom with the world in some way.  My next backyard beer with friends will be for Gordon. [end]
[start] I wish I could give more than just one upvote. What I read was so moving... [end]
[start] Thank you. This is what I needed to hear right nkw. [end]
[start] You are only 65. You have so many good years left. It is not too late to make changes and enjoy your life. Get a therapist that can teach you few coping mechanisms. You got this! You got friends in us fellow Redditters [end]
[start] Thank you so much for sharing. It’s been a rough ride for me lately and I’ve concluded to be more assertive, to take risks, be adventurous. It’s a blessing you wrote this post, as it showed me that I truly should stay by the above said goals. About to turn 30 and been living my life quietly, trying not to make mistakes, avoiding majority of interactions out of anxiety and fear. I desperately needed another perspective, something to tell me that I still have time and it can all be turned around, not all is lost yet. Yesterday my mind was clouded by suicide thoughts, by evening I’ve made decisions to change, by today morning I’m sure it’s the right path, and you’ve given me that confidence, and for that I deeply thank you! [end]
[start] Well, fuck me blue. I'm basically following a similar path to you. Luckily I don't quite think I'll have to put up with it as much as you. I've got a life plan I'm hoping to follow. [end]
[start] My fucking god... is this future me?   fuck  me... I need to get outside of my comfort zone ... like now... [end]
[start] Visit your local YMCA! I lifeguard at my local one and see so many new faces who come in and after a few visits they make new friends! It’s really a great opportunity and while your at it you will be starting a healthier lifestyle while your at it! [end]
[start] Wow got tears in my eyes ...thanx for sharing , try to get into some hobby and  maybe meet some people to spend time with . Don't give up don't stay alone . Best wishes [end]
[start] Would you ever consider psilocybin mushrooms ?  I think it could completely change your life. [end]
[start] i'm scared of the same thing happening to me and i've already thrown away my 20s but i don't know what to do [end]
[start] I am just 21 and I feel myself bordering on loneliness. I am unable to open up to people and enjoy. I have zero friends and I don't do well with my family either. After reading this, i am so scared of ending up alone now. I had a best friend who was my lover and I did a stupid mistake and now we have broken up. He was the only true friend I ever had, only true relation I ever had.   And I am so terrified that I would never be able to make friends again or fall in love or be with anyone ever.  The thought is crippling. [end]
[start] Thank you so much for sharing. This has really given me a lot of courage. [end]
[start] Dude your still here, do something stupid while you still can. Better late than never. [end]
[TITLE] I ate a sock, because people on the Internet told me to. [TITLE]

[start] Since OP forgot to record themselves eating a sock, here is someone else eating a sock over a lost bet.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LcfgpyzcjA [end]
[start] I ate an old sock on the side of the road once under a dirty snowbank in under 10 min by ripping it up into barely swallowable pellets with my bare hands in 12 degree weather.  I was 15 and earned $300.  Intestinal pain for 24 hours was barely worth it.  Proof: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110221035920AArZzIF [end]
[start] Should have eaten Adidas. Better flavor IMO. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I saw your post OP. You delivered more than David Cameron did, Bravo. [end]
[start] /u/gbay99 you're not alone! [end]
[start] Okay then.  So you decided to document every single process of prepping and eating your sock. You even went to the effort of making gifs but you didn't fully document the actual eating part, not even one bite and swallow. If you really wanted to prove yourself, go ahead and post the video anyway. I'll happily match the MP3 to the video so we can at least hear you laughing and knowing it was a terrible idea while you eat and then throw up.  Obviously you can't do this because you just recorded yourself making noises, there isn't a longer version pointing at a refrigerator, is there? [end]
[start] Found [the sock.](http://www.zappos.com/nike-cotton-lightweight-crew-with-moisture-management-3-pair-pack-grey-heather-black-obsidian-nano-grey-black-nano-grey?ef_id=Vku7VwAABAjrKzOy:20160624142210:s)  42% cotton, 37% nylon, 19% polyester, 2% Spandex.  Good luck with your digestion OP... [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I don't believe you actually ate anything but i'll give you points for effort in trying to make people think you did [end]
[start] What the fuck is wrong with you people?  [end]
[start] You're going to die and this is how we purge the world of idiots [end]
[start] But you didn't say "I'll eat a part of a sock if Britan leaves the EU!" :) [end]
[start] Ha ha! I remember the whole tfaddy affair. It was hilarious. That sub had a bot running which paged tfaddy every time anyone posted a comment with the word "sock" in it. I actually started to feel sorry for them after a while. They had to disable the bot because it was getting ridiculous.  Well done on following through with your post, though :) [end]
[start] You're my hero, dude. [end]
[start] My rottweiler eats socks all day long and he hasn't died once !  [end]
[start] I thought this was Gbay99 for a second [end]
[start] Is there no limit to what people will do for worthless karma?    [end]
[start] Bullshit. You need to show yourself doing the deed. [end]
[start] You're the hero that Britain deserves, congratulations sir.   I'll contact the Queen and we'll get you knighted ASAP  [end]
[start] I hope you took one that is either 100% wool or 100% cotton.   #you should not eat the non-natural stuff in the sock, like polyester, anything with poly and plastic based. Or rubbery.  Please tel me you removed the elastic stuff near the top?  # If not, you might want to go to the doctor already [end]
[start] You did it. I'm really proud of you.  [end]
[start] Why people do these kinds of things for some Internet validation will always be beyond me  [end]
[start] I know, the UK actualy left. It's socking. [end]
[start] Congratulations.  Next time choose a 100% wool sock, it's much easier on the digestion.  Hopefully your sock didn't have synthetic fibers in it, cooking them is quite bad. [end]
[start] If Hillary gets indicted I promised a while ago to let a randomly selected local Redditer take my nipples off with a potato slicer. Few people have reminders set on that, so we'll see how it goes.  [end]
[start] I really hope that you vomit that back for the sake of your health. Internet bet is one thing, and permanent damage to health is quite another. [end]
[start] utter bullshit, even if not, you are a stupid twat if you ate a sock. [end]
[start] I was gonna tag /u/tfaddy but he's already been tagged, the absolute madman [end]
[start] *Well, it may be stupid, but it's also dumb.* [end]
[start] Should have eaten a seaweed one like /u/tfaddy.  I think you had it worse than the guy who had to eat a penis. [end]
[start] You should post this to /r/shittyfoodporn for extra karma. Because that was some truly disgusting cooking. Nice work. [end]
[start] I hope the sock was at least cotton and didn't contain synthetic fabrics. If not, enjoy your cancer and god knows what other chemical compounds released from the cooking process. [end]
[start] I can't believe that a version of this joke made to the front page of reddit.  You should really x-post this over to r/elitedangerous [end]
[start] Sorry, but we are not sorry - The Internet [end]
[start] Lol, dumbass.  [end]
[start] Bra-fucking-vo, you magnificent bastard. You are both dumber AND braver than I. [end]
[start] You're an idiot. [end]
[start] We have to make a bunch of sacrifices to the euro gods in order to get the UK back on their good side (or some shit like that) be happy you said sock and not, well cock. [end]

[start] What happens if they rejoin? [end]
[start] Its bs just because you made some vomiting noises doesn't mean you ate something [end]
[start] The EU and UK is in disarray, the PM resigned, global economy tanked, but at least some random guy on the internet ate a sock. [end]
[start] In honor of this madness, Frontier should have Sol secede from the Federation in a community goal. [end]
[start] They are still only pictures. The audio is questionable. No direct evidence. I leave disappointed but I would've done the same probably. Shit is going down in Europe, no time to get an intestinal occlusion. [end]
[start] Way to go OP! What are your plans for the inevitable Scotland referendum? [end]
[start] They haven't officially left yet.  Why did you eat a sock early?  It doesn't even count. [end]
[start] At least you're not a squancher. [end]
[start] **OMG YOU WENT THROUGH WITH IT, TOP SHELF MY MAN** [end]
[start] I hope you're alright.   [end]
[start] Some of you guys take the internet way too seriously [end]
[start] Says no to adding meat to help it go down because he's a vegetarian. Adds eggs. What the fuck is a vegetarian then? [end]
[start] D&D 4e. For shame.  Just kidding, 4e is actually really solid, especially if you're playing with a group who don't like to number crunch. I haven't tried 5e yet. [end]
[start] /r/Sockeaters [end]
[start] Well done.  [end]
[start] Haha the internet made you eat a sock [end]
[start] You glorious mother fucker [end]
[start] > I expected it to taste like nothing--but it was a horrible feeling. I immediately regretted it upon biting, and considered stopping immediately.  A perfect analogy for Brexit. [end]
[start] what the damn hell [end]
[start] You knew exactly what you were doing. You saw all the attention the redditor who said he would eat a dick got and so you pulled the same stunt. And I don't believe you actually ate the sock anyway, there's no evidence you ate it.   Sidenote, but my last cat died from eating socks. They collected in his intenstines, he was in pain and not eating, he had to have surgery, and didn't survive because he needed blood thinner and the asshole vet on duty (who lost his license for something unrelated) didn't give him blood thinner and he died of a blood clot. Still wish I had sued.  [end]
[start] He actually did it, the absolute madman. [end]

[start] I don't know what to say. Which is worst, you eating a sock or the UK leaving EU [end]
[start] You're a stupid person. *You ate a sock.*  Take a downvote, moron. [end]
[start] I feel so torn whether to believe you actually ate it or not. [end]
[start] I wonder how many people voted to leave EU just so that you'd be forced to eat a sock.   I hope you feel terrible. [end]

[start] Stories like this are what make the internet such a beautiful place. Thank you, crazy stranger. [end]

[start] At least something good came out of going full retard on ourselves.  [end]

[start] One of the best post, i like it. thanks for sharing us. [end]

[start] Why did you eat such a big sock!?! [end]
[start] Way to be, OP [end]
[start] At first i felt funny you said that. No I felt I'm guilty as I was also a part of the internet that forced you to eat a sock. [end]
[start] Welcome to Reddit where the world can collapse and a guy eating socks is on second place. I have no idea anymore how the algorithm works....   Edit: I mean i respect you and your post is legit af, but something is really fishy with this website recently. Since they removed the disclaimer that they don't cooperate with great america. [end]
[start] Tell me it wasn't the wank sock [end]
[start] IS THIS REAL LIFE?!   WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!  YOU ATE A SOCK. YOU ATE A FUCKING SOCK. I AM LOSING MY SHIT.  Fuck, man.  Today has just been so fucking weird already... [end]
[start] I really wish you weren't eating your sock right now :( [end]
[start] Good job! [end]
[start] Now you'll be known as the guy who ate a sock. Congratulations on becoming Reddit famous and earning those Internet points. You may now go to the recreation hall with our other celebrities and enjoy your time there. Oh and please don't mention anything about gay swans and be cautious around the man and his son.  [end]
[start] We are going to need some updates tomorrow buddy... What goes in and all that.   You never know, it might floss out a few stubborn bits of chewing gum on the way through  [end]
[start] you done did good, son  [end]
[start] We need to know when you poop, take sockpoop pics [end]
[start] Waiting for the guy who raised you a steak. [end]
[start] speaking of thread... [end]
[start] No, you ate a sock cause your dumbass said you would, not cause of anyone on the internet.  [end]
[start] Well, at least you're not the UK. [end]
[start] Haha. I have now seen people eat part of a hat, part of a shirt and part of a sock because of comments like these. [end]
[start] You should have said that you'd eat a delicious juicy steak instead. [end]
[start] See this is why I never say "X will happen or I'll eat a sock." Because I just know people will let me down. [end]
[start] You ate a sock, because people on the Internet told me to - or -  you ate a sock, because you needed attention from people on the internet? [end]
[start] Clearly, this is an indication that not everyone is a [end]
[start] I love how there's always people around on Reddit to dig up these old posts. [end]
[start] **Reddit  history in the making right here!** [end]
[start] Dude, don't believe people in the internet. [end]
[start] I'm morbidly curious what this looks like when it comes out the other end.   [end]
[start] OP you need to try the sock again but with rice this time. [end]
[start] Doing something like that just to get "respect" from people on reddit.. so stupid. The things people do to feel special.. [end]
[start] Happy independence day! [end]
[start] A man of your word, fair play!  [end]
[start] I thought reddit would have learned from [the last time someone made a sock eating bet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LcfgpyzcjA) [end]
[start] ...you know we haven't left yet, right?  It could still be reversed. [end]
[start] You're an idiot. That shit is terrible for you. [end]
[start] ....he ate a *used* one? [end]
[start] You'd think that with so many people having to eat socks someone would come up with a preferred way to do it, but no. Everyone is still winging it.  [end]
[start] A few hours later on r/all- TIFU by telling the cute nurse that I ate a sock.  [end]
[start] I know it doesn't mean much, Hell it doesn't mean anything really, but thank you for keeping your word. I have mad respect for anyone that keeps their word.   At least you didn't say you'd eat a dick. I hear those are just nasty.  [end]

[start] You crazy bastard. Someone send this man a $100 Amazon gift card! [end]
[start] YOU DID IT YOU BLOODY DID IT!! MADNESS!! [end]
[start] I hope you used a cotton or wool sock, with no polyester or nylon.... [end]
[start] why did the cuck mods remove it? Reddit is seriously fucking up lately.  [end]
[start] That's the rookie way to eat it. What I've done is cutting it up more finely and then mixing it into a bowl of chili you can almost never taste it and you don't feel like shit. I've had to eat 2 socks now and that's my go to way [end]
[start] I love reddit.  [end]
[start] Wow. You will look stupid if they don't actually leave. [end]
[start] You faked it but that's better than going to the hospital.  If you ate it...you need a hospital. [end]
[start] I only nut in my socks [end]
[start] i have those same socks! [end]
[start] Why would you choose a dyed sock over something like an unbleached white sock?! That's insane. [end]
[start] > As advice to all Redditors/Imgurians: DO NOT EAT SOCKS.   [end]
[start] You did better than the guy who said he would eat a hat if Gabe Newell did an AMA. [end]
[start] Next time instead of agreeing to eat a sock, agree to make a lot of money. [end]
[start] Well at least now we all know what a sock tastes, you're a brave man. [end]
[start] You beautiful bastard!  [end]

[start] Britain hasn't technically left the EU yet. They haven't even made the Article 50 notification of their intent to withdraw yet because Cameron resigned instead of doing it himself, leaving his successor to do it.  Even so, the default timetable for leaving the EU is two years and while there is currently no way to rescind the notification of intent to leave, it could be amended if Britain decided to change its mind after filing the notification.  Similarly, it's possible that something could happen that would prevent Britain leaving the EU.  So technically you didn't need to eat the sock yet because you said you would eat a sock if Britain leaves the EU, not votes to leave the EU. [end]
[start] Pic of your poop with sock in it, or you're gonna have to eat another one, sorry OP. [end]

Or you know the all the self sacrificing fire fighters that were defrauded by your husband and brother in laws ponzi scheme.   I'm sure it doesn't matter to you though. You'll step down after making all the shitty command decisions the board imposed on you. Now you'll get your golden parachute. You've demonstrated that you're willing to go in and gut a company and take all the hate gracefully. I'm sure Bain Capitol has a job for you dismantling large companies and screwing vested pensioners out of their hard earned retirement.   People around here can start playing the whole "I'm sorry people were mean to you card",  but personally I believe you are a horrible person who will hurt people around them by any means necessary just to elevate your position in life.   I hope your husband is indicted and sent to prison and your left on the hook for millions of dollars in legal fees.  [end]

[start] >the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddit’s core principles.  If this is true, then it means all of Reddit's scapegoating, all the harassment, all the bullshit was directed to the wrong person. Typical. [end]
[start] So are you now willing to say that this was all part of the plan: > It sounds like Pao served her role as the interim CEO perfectly. People were supposed to hate her so she could make changes the board of directors wanted that they knew some users would hate. Then the white knight new CEO sweeps in to save the day and everyone is happy. They also promise to continuo Pao's mission to make this a safe place so that should be fun.    as /u/TitsAlmighty put forth? Or does an NDA and a bag o' cash prevent that?  [end]
[start] Hmmm.  I cared far less about what she did on Reddit then I did the evil she spread with her "husband".   Robbing firemen, zero excuses and it's 100% black and white. She played her part in it and stands by her evil, selfish "husband" through it all.   Court records on her wrongful dismissal case show irrefutable proof of her persecution complex and simple over estimation of her worth.   Hell, she asked for 2.7 million NOT to appeal, the exact amount her "husband" has been ordered to pay in court.   A wannabe 1% that is sadly never going to get what she deserves.  [end]
[start] Ok. Have a nice weekend, get drunk and stuff. [end]
[start] > Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddit’s core principles.  Any way you could expand upon this? This doesn't fill me with a lot of confidence for reddit's future.  Best of luck in your future endeavors. [end]
[start] Now we should get rid of Alexis Ohanian too! [end]
[start] I haven't been a fan of your tenure as CEO, but credit where credit is due: Thank you for not descending to the level of your detractors, and thank you for such a classy exit message.   For what it's worth, I hope your next opportunity is less contentious than this one has been. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I hope Buddy Fletcher meets his fate next.  [end]
[start] Lol.  Bye.    Please don't sue.  [end]
[start] Oh god, now reddit will think shitstorms get you what you want: Fuck. [end]
[start] Thank you Ellen, sorry for the hate.  Best wishes in all your future endeavors!   edit: To all future admins, as a moderator of /r/self, give us a little heads up before posting. This is a very small modteam since the level of moderation needed is small, but posts like this become my full time job for the day :) [end]
[start] >I just want to remind everyone that I am just another human; I have a family, and I have feelings. Everyone attacked on reddit is just another person like you and me. When people make something up to attack me or someone else, it spreads, and we eventually will see it. And we will feel bad, not just about what was said. Also because it undercuts the authenticity of reddit and shakes our faith in humanity.  Do you consider the feelings of the people your scamster husband fucked over too? [end]
[start] ....I thought I'd see reddit die before this happened.  I guess hell has frozen over.  Still, circlejerking aside, good luck in whatever you do next, Ellen. [end]
[start] So Ellen, based on your track record, when do you plan on suing reddit?  [end]
[start] its good that your stepping down, you did a bad job of managing reddit.  [end]
[start] Bye! [end]
[start] Always the victim. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] You and your husband are bad people. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] > I just want to remind everyone that I am just another human; I have a family, and I have feelings.   So do the people you've attempted to strangle millions from. So do the women you got fired. So do the many people you've trampled in your path. You're no saint and your feelings deserve to shit on when you shit on others for your own selfish gain. Just leave this place. Reddit exposes the fake and the faulty. We notice good and you clearly have none in you. The fact that you were exposed and then put this guilty pitty-party excuse up is just another sign that you do not belong here. Leave in peace.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Good riddance [end]
[start] Okay, fine. Now let's get Victoria Taylor back on the payroll. [end]
[start] I don't have any personal feelings about you or the situation, but I think considering the drama reddit was enduring around your employment and the overall PR nightmare, this was the best move for the company.   Good luck on future endeavors!  [end]
[start] When can we expect the lawsuit to be filed? [end]
[start] You will always have a moderator invite to /r/dickgirls waiting for you, Ellen.  You should come in sometime. We're an eclectic bunch. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] >remember the human  I think that's the point, you were pretty inhuman with your explanations for most everything.  A good leader is open, transparent, and able to give and receive critical feedback.  You didn't exhibit this.  I hope you take this as an opportunity to develop your leadership skills. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Ugh, all the people apologizing. go to /r/circlejerk. Glad she is gone, reddit was so close to failing with her as CEO.  [end]
[start] Wow.   Playing the "victim card" is exactly what I expected from you Ms. Pao.  You were the CEO of one of the biggest websites on the net and honestly, you did a terrible job at handeling it.  Banning subreddits, censoring, shadow banning, terrible communication between mods, admins and the whole commuity, topped off with the release of one of your most important members without ANY plan or coordination.  We never heard a word from you, just "second hand" information by insiders which frankly, weren't very pleasant.   I'm sure you're not responsible for every shit that went on the past couple of months, but jesus christ you were the CEO.  IT IS YOUR JOB TO TAKE THE FLAK AND FUCKING DEAL WITH IT!  But well, playing the victim card and pleading to **"remember the human"** fits perfectly into the stereotype reddit has of you.  Good Bye Ms. Pao. You surely won't be missed.  **Edit:** To be clear, this post is not defending those ridiculous "Hitler comparisons" etc. which got popular during the melt down. Those were immature and unnecssary. This post is about Ellen Paos obvious incompetence with being the CEO of such a huge website and her "resignation". [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] This is a massive group of manics, swiftly changing from one extreme to the next.  Shit's getting old. [end]
[start] Ellen,      Over the course of a few years, I have been an avid and active member of reddit and many communities within it. Throughout that time, there are a handful of incidents which made me embarrassed to call myself a "redditor".       One of those incidents has been occurring over the last few months, stemming from my observance of how many members of the reddit community have treated you and spoken of you during your tenure as interim CEO.      I'm not particularly interested in delving into details, as I am sure you are not particularly interested in reading them. I just wanted to let you know that while I have questioned the motives behind some of the decisions made at reddit HQ lately, I always understood that your responsibility was to run the company, not the community. A CEO owes a duty, in both a legal and a professional sense, to do what is in the best interest of the company.     It's always the unhappiest people who speak the loudest, and we have seen the worst-case scenario of that old adage firsthand this year. I am sorry for the things you've had to experience, however know that not even the majority of redditors held you in such low regard.      Good luck in your future endeavors. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Good riddance. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] > More recently, several users apologized for trolling me and for not giving me the benefit of the doubt when the troll hivemind moved against me. Initially users said they were afraid to post supportive messages openly; recently they started fighting back against the trolls publicly on reddit with support, corrections and positive messages.  Because [200,000+ people who signed this petition are trolls](https://www.change.org/p/ellen-k-pao-step-down-as-ceo-of-reddit-inc), I believe that about as much as I can afford as I can afford an apartment in San Francisco. I disliked you from the start because of you're tone-deafness of the community and you're obtuse, hypocritical, and downright mind-boggling decisions. As far as I'm concerned /u/kn0thing is the same as you, you have forgotten the very basic principle that you can't eat your cake and have it too. You can't have reddit be this grand, all encompassing representation of the internet (i.e. "the front page of the internet") and just try to shoo away all the bad things about the internet at the same time. That's what made reddit great, it was like a living, breathing human who changed with me, who could be dark and angry but could also be wonderful, hilarious, and irreverant. All you and Ohanian want now is to sanitize and monetize, spruce up the place and spray for bugs, and then rent it out to the highest bidder.   You, Ohanian, and the trolls deserve one another.    [end]
[start] As a public figure and CEO of a prominent company, you weren't above criticism... but holy shit the hate aimed at you is truly embarrassing for the community as a whole.   I'd like to think we'll reflect upon you were treated, but we're rarely so introspective these days.  >So why am I leaving? Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddit’s core principles.  Well that's an interesting statement.  Good luck and take care.   Edit: I'm just going to leave this here  https://www.reddit.com/r/firespez/  [end]
[start] Goodbye. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Hey Ellen, what's your favorite pizza topping?  [end]
[start] good riddance [end]
[start] I don't get it... did it literally take someone saying they're human for reddit to realise that maybe they're being a bit cruel? [end]
[start] I have no feelings on this at all. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] You know what, fuck you Ellen. It didn't bother me that people used you to place blame, it was just words on a screen. The death threats, and cancer hopes were fucked up though. That was uncalled for, you're right there.   It didn't bother me that you appeared to seemingly be the one that threw this site into a downward spiral, firing two admin's and a cancer survivor. Shit happens in business...    But I will NOT sit here, while you sit smugly behind your fucking computer or mobile or whatever the fuck you're using to talk to us, I REFUSE to sit here and accept a *filthy, disgusting, piece of trash Orange Red.*   YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR PAO.   MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS DESERVE TO BE REMEMBERED.    NEVER FORGET PERIWINKLE. [end]
[start] Hey /u/ekjp - [You know what this is?...](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/02/violin-steve-buscemi.gif) [end]
[start] Time to write a book. Strike while the iron is hot.  [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Dear Ellen,  Go fuck yourself. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Why are you talking to us AFTER resigning? Your relationship with people on reddit could have been salvageable if you just talked to us. :( Like you said, it can be hard to remember that the person behind the computer is also human, and I think many of us forgot that.  [end]
[start] bye [end]
[start] Thank you for resigning, Ellen. I... honestly don't like the decisions you made very much. At all really. But I do not know you as a person. That it is back in the hands of someone that Reddit loves and trusts makes me very happy. I wish you the best, but I'm happy to see Reddit back aligned with its original vision. [end]
[start] That's the first time I've ever seen the word 'porn' in a resignation letter. [end]
[start] Controversy aside, I think what you said about remembering there's a human being on the other end of any online interaction is so, so important. The hurt caused by some text that someone casually cast off can be very real. The communication being indirect does not grant you permission to be cruel. Good luck in life, /u/ekjp   Edit: Look, it's generally good advice that applies outside of this situation. [end]
[start] Good riddance. [end]
[TITLE] Half of the articles on the front page are over 9 FUCKING HOURS OLD. I READ THEM AT WORK THIS MORNING. FIX THE GODDAMN ALGORITHM. FUCK. [TITLE]
[start] Not sure why everyone is being weird about this, surely most people have noticed over the past few months the front page has grown relatively stale?  As you say often posts 9 hours and older are regularly on the front page, posts that were seen in the morning will still be there at the end of the day, many posts seen the night before will still be there the next morning.  Its frustrating and no-one is talking about it which is bizarre.  [end]
[start] Also. /r/all became like 30% shitty porn. I don't mind seeing a few links every so often, but it's a huge amount now. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Yeah it's absolutely trash. Often times I have multiple posts of 20+ hours old, they are completely worthless, there's not a discussion to be had anymore. [end]
[start] I have noticed that breaking news events take around 20-30 minutes for them to reach the front page, whereas before if it was big enough they would get there almost instantly.  It's reduced the value of Reddit for me personally, as I now see news articles posted elsewhere before I catch them via Reddit.  This might be observation bias, but it does seem the algorithm has changed and as a consequence the site has slowed down. [end]
[start] Why are people responding like there isn't a problem with the algorithm? It's well known that there's a problem and reddit have even said they're working on completely revamping it.  [end]
[start] they're turning it into cable news, same shit all day long [end]
[start] And as I read this, your post is 9 hours old and is #5 on my front page. [end]
[start] Sort by top:hour [end]
[start] Idk if you've noticed this or not but Reddit overall is degrading, going the way of Digg and others before it.  The user base gets younger, the content gets weaker, PC SJWs are moderators in all of the big subs, and censorship is at an all time high. Why is there censorship when we have downvotes?   This website is compromised, perfect time for a competitor to swoop in. [end]
[start] And it's all because reddit wanted to censor /r/The_Donald      [end]
[start] Just change your settings so when you vote a thread it doesn't show up again [end]
[start] Case in point: this thread is on my front page 11 hours after being posted. [end]
[start] Well said. It's been a nightmare for months. I've started using sort by: Top - Hour. Even 'New'. Even fucking New.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Use 'hide' functionality more often. [end]
[start] 9 hours? Try 16. I have several posts on my front page over 12 hours old.  [end]
[start] https://www.reddit.com/top/  Set time to Hour [end]
[start] I'm with ya, buddy. I exclusively browse /all and /new (I'm not sensitive, I can handle all the content. Bring it on!), and my job lets me have Reddit running in the background during renders pretty much all day.  The same shit is on the frontpage in the morning when I start, as in the evening when I finish. Regularly. Sometimes its nice to check updated comments, but ... [end]
[start] They will. After the election is over. They just need to keep /r/The_Donald down for a couple more months, then they will revert to the old algorithm. [end]
[start] I know right. Between this and the way Facebook has changed theirs, im about to go outside and actually do something with my life.... *sigh* [end]
[start] Weird, just found this on the front page... It's only 11 hours old :D yeah, algorithm is fucked... [end]
[start] This is on my front page, 13 hours old. [end]
[start] This is still on the front page 13 hours later.   [end]
[start] I'm seeing this at 20 hours old! [end]
[start] Biggest irony. I had this post on my Frontpage yesterday night. I wake up and here it is still there.  [end]
[start] I was literally thinking the same thing as I was scrolling and sooo many posts were stuff I saw yesterday (>20 hrs old). It's getting pretty bad. [end]
[start] Looks like it's all the same handful of accounts too... FUCKING powerusers [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] It has been this way for a year. You just have to either "Hide when voted on" or click the "hide" link under the OP. Sucks but we've come to adapt. [end]
[start] Seriously, reddit is basically identical to how it was before the change, except just a little bit duller and a little more work to find fresh content. What is the value in that? Why did they try to fix what isn't broken?  [end]
[start] THANK YOU. This shit sucks ass. Staring at the same titles for 15 hours is bullshit. It wasn't always this way either.   Started right about when they started advertising. [end]
[start] It got really bad recently when they rolled out the new advertising crap because advertisers want their posts to stay up longer and get more views/engagement.  [end]
[start] There is an option to hide posts that you've voted on  Keeps my front page nice and fresh [end]
[start] You should be up and down voting things and have them set to disappear after you do so.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] no we have to stop Donald trump posts from hitting top of r all  that is the priority [end]
[start] and porn everywhere. All because the Shill Admins cant bear to see Donald Trump sub getting upboated.  [end]
[start] This is on my first front page and ironically is 9 hours old! [end]
[start] A new hobby perhaps? [end]
[start] Hey, OP. (/u/aDAMNPATRIOT)  > We’ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we’d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We’re still in the early days, but I’m happy we’re dedicating resources to it.  https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4x35a3/click_to_hear_about_some_of_the_things_that_have/   [end]
[start] Still on my front page. [end]
[start] And there is a post from /r/anal at #52 right now. [end]
[start] /r/all or https://www.reddit.com/me/f/all works pretty well.   [end]
[start] Meanwhile this is frontpage and 10 hours old. [end]
[start] Ha, it's 3 on my front page after 10 hours, 51 on all.. [end]
[start] Can confirm, this article is 9 hours old. [end]
[start] It looks, and feels, hand picked. Perhaps they hired some of the guys that curated facebook or google? Maybe they work for correct the record? [end]
[start] Checks out. Here I am seeing this post again 10 hours later [end]
[start] ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I'm more annoyed that 1/5th is porn in the morning (GMT+1) [end]
[start] looks like r/rant would be perfect for you! [end]
[start] This is the second time I've seen this post..... because my front page runs in a loop [end]
[start] In all seriousness, some posts were on the FP yesterday also. They aren't reposts either cause the posts age is 1 day. It's been broken ever since they messed with it a little after Pao left. [end]
[start] Also is it me or is half the front-page just porn nowadays? [end]
[start] I'm more pissed about all the old reposts and political spotlights dissapearing [end]
[start] Fucking christ, seriously. I looked at the front page last night, wake up this morning and there's shit I already have seen. What gives [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Reddit has a cool option to hide posts you vote on, so I just upvote every post so I never see repeats except for x posts [end]
[start] Chill [end]
[start] Go to r/all, filter out the subs you don't want to see using RES or whatever app you use. Sort by Hot. I get new shit on the regular and this opens me up to seeing subreddit I never knew existed.      Sometimes, though, you accidentally see things you wish you hadn't before realizing which subreddit it came from... [end]
[start] Am I the only one who uses hide up/down voted stuff?   There's seriously no reason to be so angry about something you use for enjoyment   "yeah it's fun but it isn't fun enough so therefore I'm PISSED" [end]
[start] 9 hours? I see this now, 13 hours later. I also see a number of 15-20, even 23-hour old posts. [end]
[start] I havent seen a ask reddit thread on my r/all in two days.  I saw thesame goddamn r/video (hehe something) post two days in a row.    Also it depends on the app im using as well.    My wife gets totally different r/all fo that matter.   And porn.. Lot of porn [end]
[start] This is on the front page and it's 15 hours old.  [end]
[start] Meanwhile, this is 16 hours old and on my front page.  [end]
[start] This is both a good and bad thing for me.  For example there's this post of yours, it's 17 hours old now, but it's the first time I'm seeing it on my front page.  Then there's the same bloody posts I've been seeing for the whole day, I want to see new stuff but don't want to go into individual subs. I could've sworn the front page used to refresh every 30 minutes or something. [end]
[start] This shit is still on my front page [end]
[start] Case in point, this post is #15 on my front page and it's 17 hours old... [end]
[start] Not only that, but the biggest slowdown in browsing Reddit is waiting for out.reddit.com to track my clicks and direct me to where I want to go. [end]
[start] Voat.co ;) [end]
[start] This is close to the top of my front page and it is now 17 hours old =[ [end]
[start] submitted 18 hours ago by aDAMNPATRIOT [end]
[start] Just saw this post on the front page.... 18 hours after post. [end]
[start] Your post is 18 hours old and still on my front page. The fucking irony. [end]
[start] I saw this 9 hours ago.   [end]
[start] Hilariously, I read this earlier today when I woke up...well over 12 hours ago. [end]
[start] I guess they got a little too aggressive with trying to get/r/the_donald off of the front page. [end]
[start] I agree what sucks is I up vote something and 20 hours later it's still there I have to go back and down vote it just to remove it from the front page  [end]
[start] Here's my front page right now:    \# | Hours old -|--------- 1 | 6 2 | 7 3 | 5 4 | 5 5 | 8 6 | 2 7 | 5 8 | 12 9 | 4 10 | 14 11 | 14 12 | 11 13 | 11 14 | 15 15 | 13 16 | 13 17 | 16 18 | 15 19 | 2 20 | 12 21 | 9 22 | 15 23 | 22 24 | 4 25 | 16  Average age of post: approx 10.5 hours.  Percentage of posts more than 8 hours old: 64%  (FWIW, I'm subscribed to relatively few defaults.)  [end]
[start]  It's the only way to prevent THe_Donald from dominating - they have at least a couple dozen posts over 2500 every 24 hours so if the algorithm catered to a faster pace they'd be right back up with 10+ posts in the top 25 regularly.   So instead you get yesterday's news.  [end]
[start] But then how can we worry about peoples feelings and our overlords public image? [end]
[start] Go to your settings and change it to 'hide liked/disliked' you will have a new front page every refresh.  [end]
[start] This post is 7 hours old and still on my front page lol. [end]
[start] /r/the_donald was getting a little TOO popular, Reddit thought police had to do something. [end]
[start] I would tell you to go to /r/all, but you might save some time if you go directly to /r/the_donald =) [end]
[start] CTR needed to get The_Donald under control and this was a quick-fix algorithm that kept them from reaching the masses without "specifically" targeting them. Remember how they said it was an "improvement" to the site? Ha. [end]
[start] They can't. This happened after the_donald dominated r/all in the wake of the florida terrorism attack (apologies, I mean a white cis male caused attack by the religion of peace to fight the patriarchy)   This site, being an extreme left wing circle jerk literally cut its nose of to spite itself. It would rather die than give any airspace to the God Emperor.   Ave imperator, TRUMP  [end]
[start] Its because advertisers were complaining that their astro-turfing stories were getting buried too fast. [end]
[start] PC/SJW mods trying to push a certain agenda. It's fairly obvious to most people who have been here a few years.  Lots of censorship lately, however, reddit is waking up to that and realizing how unhealthy it is to cover up the news and pushing back.  [end]
[start] fyi you can have reddit hide posts that you have viewed already, it's in your preferences. [end]
[start] That's nothing, i work the overnight, so i'm seeing all the posts i already saw last night.  [end]
[start] You can set your preferences to hide any post you've voted up or down on.  Just vote away the stale. [end]
[start] They reduced the frequency of same subreddits reaching the front. Which is probably what you're seeing because the old ones aren't being refreshed.  It's because of the debacles with advertising maximization, and /r/the_donald, and /r/fatpeoplehate [end]
[start] Calm down. Sheesh. [end]
[start] Can't, the wrong messages and narrative would get too much attention, and curating that comes before any other priority [end]
[start] So the other half is new content, what's wrong with that? You guys want a full rotation every 6 hours or something? "Did you see that article about X yesterday on reddit?" "No, I wasn't able to get on during work yesterday and missed all those posts" [end]
[start] Switch view to "rising",  [end]
[start] It is helpful, however, if you want to spend less time on reddit. [end]
[start] It's not the algorithm, all the cool people who made reddit great either left elsewhere less sickeningly corporate or grew old and boring. [end]
[start] What I've realised is that there is a lot less news, and more random meme bullshit.   A lot of people didn't like the news because of the US Pres. race, but since they've dumbed that down, I see a lot less of all news, which is annoying because I don't like having to go through every news SR to see stories.   On my FP at the minute, half of the stories are between 17-24 hours old, which is fucking ridiculous.  [end]
[start] oddly enough i'm seeing this post when its 8 hours old. I'm still seeing articles that i read yesterday. Please reddit free me from this hell. [end]
[start] I've started using the "Rising" tab significantly, just to get new content. [end]
[start] It's one to the point where I ony really check Reddit once a day.anymorw and all I'm seeing is stuff from 12 hours ago. [end]
[start] This post is eight hours old and it's on my front page. 👌 [end]
[start] [Checking reddit front page for the first time this morning](https://imgur.com/a/1M6zB) [end]
[start] go back to your wormhole adp ;-)  [end]
[start] Coming from the front page, just now seeing this post it's 9 hours old. That's fucking cold right there. [end]
[start] Nm   [end]
[start] This post is now 9 hours old, I call bullshit. [end]
[start] http://i.imgur.com/wt6dwQQ.png [end]
[start] I don't see the problem. I'm from the UK and most posts are 10 or so hours old when I wake up. Inly time I get <5h posts is around 4 or 5 o clock.  [end]
[start] This post is now 9 hours old and #45 on the frontpage.   The algorithm change to try and remove some of the_donald from the frontpage didnt even work in censoring them. It multiplied the amount of porn on r/all and stopped the top from evolving. Good going reddit. [end]
[start] Ironically, this post is 9 hours old as I am reading it.  [end]
[start] Just saw this in the front page.  It's 9 hours old. [end]
[start] I'm reading this and it's nine hours old. [end]
[start] Turn off the computer. Take your meds. [end]
[start] I needed to start using the hide function. Otherwise the front page doesn't change.. [end]
[start] And it's been nine hours and I see this on the frontpage. Quite ironic. [end]
[start] Just saw this on my front page: it's 9 hours old.  [end]
[start] Yeah i hate how its been for like the last year. [end]
[start] *This was posted 9 hours ago! Give me something fresh!*  [end]
[start] I'll remember to upvote this in about 3 hours... when it's still on the front page. [end]
[start] 9 hours? Theres stuff that has been up for almost a day. Set your view to 100 pages for more content they said. It would be fun they said.    [end]
[start] are there any reddit alternatives? For like you know, when reddit goes down [end]
[start] They had to control the Donald sub.  It dominated reddit for a while. It started to disrupt the narrative.  [end]
[start] I have on occasion been frustrated by the speed that the front page has changed formerly too fast and recently to slow. Could we maybe get a choice of fast lane or slow? Old algorithm or new. New to reddit or I've been here a bit and don't need to see all the reposts for an 8 hour cycle? [end]
[start] Ironically, this post is on the front page and is 10 hours old. [end]
[start] Commenting to say that I am reading this when the post is 10 hours old-- I found it at the top of the front page.  [end]
[start] I hear in the last update they added a "hide" button, so you don't have to see a story again after you click it. Pretty neat! [end]
[start] How about getting a hobby... [end]
[start] I noticed. There are many other who notice and don't bother to say anything.  Reddit really needs to fix this  [end]

[start] Well, he's not wrong. [end]
[start] i'm reading this at work when it's 13 hours old... [end]
[start] When I see a lack of new stuff on the front page, then I know I'm wasting too much time on Reddit.  [end]
[start] Oh they'll fix the algorithm alright....censor anything bad about Hillary and push up to the top anything negative about the right. Reddit is a censoring POS.  [end]
[start] This post is now 13 hours old and on my frontpage still. WTF [end]
[start] At the time of me writing this, this post is 14 hours old, and still on the front page.  It's like rai-ai-ain, on your wedding day. [end]
[start] I got to page 26, where everything is just reposts from the front page in other smaller subreddits.  I'm sad to say that Facebook is now more original and interesting. [end]
[start] Who even checks the Reddit front page anymore?  It's manipulated to grind to a halt any active or interesting discussions. Notice how if any post gets "hot" it's yanked from the front page in short order?   To a lesser degree this is happening in all the sub Reddits, too. [end]

[TITLE] DO NOT LIE ON YOUR RESUME [TITLE]
[start] I couldn't agree more with the honesty piece. Back when I was in college, I had failed a required class to graduate, and had to retake it *after I had already walked in graduation*.  As I waited for the summer class to start, I was invited to apply for this job as an analyst, and explained my situation to the HM. The manager appreciated my honesty and gave me an offer, and let me finish up the last class for my degree conferral. [end]
[start] I convey the story often but a guy I knew in college (but who did not attend college) just made up a completely fake resume and got an 80k/year sales job with a fortune 500 company. This was in 1998 though.   He just taught himself the technology, taught himself how to code, was tall, clean-cut, well-spoken, and smart.    6 months in to his job he met a woman at work, married her, and by the time he was 25 was pulling down 6 figures. Oh, and his wife also pulled down 6 figures.  I don't know if he told her he never went to college and faked his whole resume. They wisely relocated to the west coast a short time afterward.  [end]
[start] A guy who I know from uni once had in his resume that he speaks French fluently. He apparently applied for an investment banking role in London at JP Morgan and got invited for an interview at the office. During the interview, he was asked to explain how quantitative easing works in French. That went terribly bad for him and got him blacklisted for the future. He had it coming though.  Edit: that guy is Dutch and probably took six years of French classes in high school. In my experience, most Dutch people who take French classes during high school, including me, don't speak French well enough. Not even on a conversational level.  [end]
[start] I served on a jury where the defendant was a government engineer.  Turned out his whole resume was a fraud.  The university he claimed to have graduated from didn't exist.  The investigator talked about how its web page was fake, the address listed on it was someone's house, and some evidence that suggested the defendant had made the site.  The defendant said something about how he couldn't register an .edu as an individual...yeah, I checked later, the site was a .org.  The guy was basically just a fountain of lies.    The thing is, his supervisor, who hired him, had never investigated anything in his resume before hiring him.  Apparently despite having no training in anything related to the job, he was actually good at the job.    The dude was on trial for something completely unrelated to his job.  None of this would have come out if he hadn't lied about something else and been caught.    If he'd been able to just stop lying once he'd gotten his reasonably cushy job secured, lying on his resume would have paid off quite well for him.  But I guess that's where trust comes in.  People who are gonna do this (particularly someone who's gonna lie about something trivial, like your guy) just DON'T FUCKING STOP.  If they see an opportunity for dishonesty to give them an advantage later, they're gonna take it, and you can't count on them having enough conscience to care if it hurts someone else.   [end]
[start] I work with hazardous materials and have a degree in chemistry. Where are you? [end]
[start] This happened to a friend of mine who’s a lawyer. A rival law firm was blasted in the newspaper when it was discovered that one of their lawyers had never passed the bar exam and therefore was not licensed to practice law in that state. A huge no-no.  Clients were pissed. All of his work had to be reassigned and reviewed. Malpractice insurer had to be notified. A real shitshow.   Apparently, over the next couple of days, the state bar association got blown up with phone calls from every firm in town verifying whether all of their lawyers were actually licensed to practice.  (This was before bar association websites listing all lawyers in good standing were a thing).  [end]
[start] Embellish, extrapolate, extend, but never lie [end]
[start] Oh shit, he forgot the most basic rule. Lie about the future, not the past. [end]
[start] Well, you’re giving one example when it’s not worth it, but there may be many examples when it is worth it! [end]
[start] Baskin Robin's always finds out. [end]
[start] Oh, the irony.  I'm absolutely honest and still can't get a better job!  Every other incompetent moron has come and gone around me and I'm still stuck.  I'm finding that the jobs posted have already been filled before the posting.   Some have even been filled without posting (and these are State jobs). [end]
[start] Wow, and he had a degree and just lied about where he got it, that's an odd one. Usually they just lie about having a degree.  Long story short- a long time I ago I worked at a place where a guy got his his boyfriend a high ranking position and the guy claimed he went to Brown. I'd be surprised if this nitwit had graduated high school he was so stupid. I have no idea why he thought the wouldn't check but three months into his job, he's still working there, I go into his office and literally hear him telling HR "well Brown had a fire, I think all the records were destroyed"  Needless to say, a couple weeks later they "officially" realized he never went to Brown and fired him, security escorted him out of the building, he was crying like a baby and I was cheering (let's just say this meant I didn't have to do his work anymore...). [end]
[start] I assume these are cases of people who do not use LinkedIn, as it is harder to lie on LinkedIn where your entire lies are available online for all your contacts (assuming including college friends or former colleagues) to find out, right? [end]
[start] I've 80% lied on 100% of resumes. I personally think it is worth it. Employment nowadays is war not an agreement.  [end]
[start] Throwaway. soo I actually lied on my resume entirely about my work experience.  Wanted to get into a new field and skip the climb up the ladder that would've taken 5-6 years.  I did, however, study my ass off at home in preparation for the role, as well as received a little coaching from people already in similar positions.  Been working here for almost 2 years now, am doing great and receiving great feedback.  Honestly, no regrets.  &#x200B; [end]
[start] Yeah, exaggerating on your resume is expected... what you don't do is tell verifiable lies. [end]
[start] I've got a similar story. Guy listed two certs on his resume and spoke in the interview line he had both of them. Neither was required for the position, but were 'nice to haves'.  I make an offer contingent on background investigation, then find that he's 'in progress' on one of them.  The offer is immediately rescinded.  Had he just listed in progress he'd be working for me today, but that one lie cost him a $110k job.  Don't lie on your resume. I can't work with you if I can't trust you. [end]
[start] Lies are like leaving DNA at a crime scene.  They’re in the evidence room.  You never know what event in the future will bring that box out again for reexamination.  When I was a PhD student at uni, my wife had a good friend whose husband was also a doctoral student but in a completely different field.  At the end of my coursework, we left the country for a couple of years.  After coming back I got a one year job at another uni, while I finished up my dissertation.  Big surprise when we found the other couple at the same uni.  The other guy appeared to have done the final steps and had a secure job.  But he hadn’t, and the school discovered he didn’t have a PhD and quietly terminated him.  His wife, not knowing he hadn’t finished or that he had lied, was furious with the school for their abusive behavior.  We knew the truth, but didn’t think it was up to us to tell her. [end]
[start] I'm going to have to disagree when just recently I saw on local news that over half the people currently employed in my current country lied on their CV. Key word being employed. [end]
[start] Phd chemist, what city are you in.  [end]
[start] I mean he’s dumb enough to lie about the school and have faulty references when he provided you contact information to verify... but there are many instances where it’s beneficial (not ethical) to lie on your resume.  [end]
[start] This is an example of how companies rely too much on college degrees and certifications to judge an applicants capabilities.  This directly correlates to applicants lying on their resumes.  I've known too many people with impressive and factual college degrees also be extremely incompetent.   [end]
[start] I worked at the registrars office this last year at my university. We worked with cases like this at least twice a week. Someone either says they went there and didn’t, or said they got a degree which they didn’t earn. It still amazes me people try to get past this. We also had someone try to say they were a student who has not been alive for over 30 years.  [end]
[start] Are you kidding me? You can lie all day long right in people's faces and still be President of the United States. [end]
[start] Uh, no, it’s totally worth it. Sometimes ya have to fake it ‘till ya make it! Boost those resumes people.  [end]
[start] I interviewed a lot of people for software engineering positions over the last few years. In that process I encountered quite a few people who claimed years of programming experience and multiple programming languages on their resumes, yet somehow can't manage to write a simple function in their preferred language. Are they all lying? I don't know, since I'm not authorized to call their schools or ex-employers. But really, how do you explain a C++ programmer with 5+ years of experience not knowing how to define a class? [end]
[start] Lol he had a degree but still lied. Dumbass [end]
[start] It's pretty fucked up in this day and age when some privy dipshit went to a 10k a year middle school gets a job over someone who went to a public based solely on something looks that. In this day and age when employers expect you to be a Harvard graduate to flip fucking burgers, I can't blame a guy for lying. [end]
[start] I mean I’m sure people will rarely check your resume if it’s like McDonald’s or some place like it right? [end]
[start] ...unless you work in the film industry. Then it’s more or less required to lie on your resume.  [end]
[start] It's NEVER worth it. You will be found out, and it will not end well. Even if you're not found out, you're always worried, and looking over your shoulder. In addition, if a friend or colleague recommends you for a job, and you lie...IT REFLECTS BACK on the person who generously tried to help. Ask me how I know...  I referred a capable friend for a job at a huge and growing PC company HQ'd in Houston, in the 80's. Yeah. Compaq. It was the place to be. (at the time Tim Cook was VP Logistics). Guy was qualified, interviewed well, e'thing looked great, except he lied about a degree from RIT. He had no such degree. Background check exposed him. Degree mandatory for the job. No dice. When I called him on the BS, he made up such a BS story about how RIT lost his records, blah blah. He lied to the company and to me. I never spoke to him again. No question in my mind, this reflected on me. "Why would he recommend this fraud"?.    Yes, my friend could absolutely excel at the job in question. He knew a degree was required. This guy pissed on my trust and my reputation. He should never had applied.  Second example. I'm at cisco in 1995 or so Holy shit what a great place to be. A former co-worker (again, smart, capable, super qualified) applied for a job there. At that time csco only worried about degrees if you're an accountant, or attorney or such. Again the guy could run rings around the job, would have been a great hire, and would have made a TON of money in options. Dumb ass lied about a degree he didn't have, and didn't need. Again. No Dice. He lied. Blacklisted forever. Glad to say I had nothing to do with this one. Only heard about it.   [end]
[start] Am I the only one who finds that being dishonest in certain types of situations makes me trust the person more? I met this guy at work who, unknown to anyone, lied about his IT desk help certifications on his resume. Long story short, he couldn't get the certifications because of financial reasons and when he was hired, took all of the tests to be certified and passed them with ease. Company fired him shortly after all because he lied on the resume. He was an extremely hard worker and we still haven't found anyone as proficient at the job as he was.  [end]
[start] That’s wild, when I read the title I thought you meant like you shouldn’t embellish on your resume but nope, this dude lied about even going to school... [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I'll take the job. Potato salad! [end]
[start] I fibbed in my resume about not getting fired from the corporation I used to work for, while applying for the same one, different location. But, in my defense, I was inappropriately fired for an appt I HAD to go to. Everyone refused to covered me even tho I'd spent an entire year covering everyone else and never missed a day. Everyone else could call out with no coverage and not get fired.    This place won't even call to check. There just like, experience, cool, I don't have to bother training so much.  [end]
[start] Can someone call this guy and tell him "oh for fuck's sake DUDE!" [end]
[start] I had a resume pass my desk where the prospective employee claimed to have done my job. (A very specific position on a major project.) He had worked for me for a short time in a minor role.   Bummer for him. He did not get an interview.  [end]
[start] I work for a pretty big company in HR and see this stuff backfire all the time on the candidates. I don't think candidates realize what exactly a background check company does, especially around employment and education checks. We don't call the contact numbers they list on their form (why would we, it could be their mom's number!).  Most employers use automated verification sites, and the BG company will do their own research to find the proper source. We also require W2s or paystubs if the employer can't verify. Same for education.   I had a candidate (who I had a gut feeling was lying, as he was a bit too charming) take the time to make up fake documentation including letters, email addresses to contact, and fake names on literally every employer when the BG company came up dry. Also made up having a degree. The sad part was the degree wasn't required for the role, and they could have just explained the gaps in employment -we get it, life happens. But now they've painted themselves as lacking integrity.  It's frustrating from our end if you imagine the amount of time- we the potential employer invest in someone, only to have to start over in a search.   [end]
[start] Or at least tell lies that you can back up! I'm making $25 an hour right now, purely based on lies. [end]
[start] I’ve never lied on a resume but I’ve lied in every interview I’ve ever had and never not got the job.  There’s like 5 jobs on the planet you can’t learn while doing it.  [end]
[start] This is the extreme, but honestly, lie on your resume kids. [end]
[start] I put that I graduated from UCSD with a Degree in Business in 1997, been @ my job for the County for 14 years in February. I’ve NEVER even stepped foot on a college campus. [end]
[start] What I got from this is if you lie on your resume prepare for the chance you could be caught.   [end]
[start] Lying about certifications is a terrible idea.   Some places have a real reason for requiring them.   For example,  working on some servers or computer equipment without a certain certification can void warranties. [end]
[start] This reminded me of dwight interviewing mose [end]
[start] Same thing at my work.  So many candidates lie and for whatever reason think nobody checks.  These goobers are fucking hilarious. [end]
[start] My friend has that she’s fluent in Japanese on hers and I’m concerned when that’s gonna bite her in the ass [end]
[start] Funny, most jobs in the USA don't really care WHERE you got a degree, unless it's an ivy league school, or you're working on walls street. [end]
[start] I know one is supposed to sell themselves on their resume, but when I had to look for a job, I'd keep my resume somewhat short and boring.   This means I didn't lie on it.  Where I "won" was on the interview.  I didn't lie there, either.  I would be prepared. [end]
[start] Fuckin A it’s hard enough competing against qualified people for positions...  [end]
[start] I gotta disagree. Lie your ass off if there's the slightest chance of getting away with it. This is a ruthless world and you have to be ruthless. Life's too short to play by the rules. You can have a cushy job and feel guilty about lying, or you can starve in the gutter with your morals. [end]
[start]  I detest the "fake it 'ill you make it" ethos regardless of how much it is glorified and normalized.  It's patently dishonest.  [end]
[start] Do employers really not check certification for a new hire?  [end]
[start] Yeah, he shouldn't have lied, but can we talk about why people feel the need to lie in the first place? [end]
[start] I used to work in staffing for a short time and a client of mine was an executive with a healthcare company. One day I arrived in his office for a scheduled meeting and they inform me he has been let go. When I asked why they told me he had fabricated his education history and had been working in the medical field for over 10 years, working his way up from a nursing position to an executive of a home health care company without any medical education. This man had been taking care of elderly patients with no medical education at all!!! People are so shocked when these things happen but the number of people who don't check references/education history is astounding. This man had worked at three different hospitals before ending up at his last job and not one had bothered to check.  [end]
[start] Have to give my version of a similar story.  A guy was hired into to my unit prior too me being his manager.  Had a good resume, and has done the work we do at several other companies, and our experiences of his work for us is positive - until.   We send his resume out to a client, to get a contract doing our work at one of our customers.   About a week later, we get a email from one of our sales reps, there's an issue with his resume.  Our employees resume matches client for client, date for date with another contractor.  Seems wierd, and the client won't hire him for the work. ( Not sure what happened to the other person).  Worse part is now our sales team won't sent this guy out for any interviews because of this discrepancy.  Since our employees are utilization driven and measured, he doesn't get any further work and I'm forced to terminate him.     All we can figure out is that he was brought to the US by the same placement company as the other person with duplicate resume.  They know/knew which companies won't give out any information about past employees, so they give all their 'recruits' the same resume and send them out into the business world.  Certainly, no one would think out of all these companies that 2 of their recruits would end up going to the same place, right?    Now it is entirely possible these two guys simultaneously worked at the same customers, as much of our work was project based and they worked on the same projects.   The only reason this ends up being false is the two guys didn't know each other, and supposedly they worked at the same for businesses, at the same time!  Have to assume if they were doing the same technical work at the same location, they'd have to meet at least once.  For those of you wondering, they were both from India.  [end]
[start] Ya don’t lie on easy to verify facts. But the small stuff, of course lie.  [end]
[start] I agree, however I have a close friend who lied about a 2 year associates degree and has been with this large publicly traded company for over 10 years now and he makes big bucks. I’d say he’s a rare exception though for sure. I’m a little jelly of him tbh.  [end]
[start] You really can't get away with what you might have been able to in decades past. Almost every company now does thorough background checks and everything you have done is tracked.   I just applied for a weekend part time job restocking shelves. I am in the current process of having a criminal record check done, a back ground check by a third party company that is checking all my previous addresses and education. I had to fill out an online form that signs all my privacy away allowing them to do this.  plus all my references and previous employers and are being called. I had to fill out and sign a bunch of forms as well.   Its crazy how even for a part time job this much is being done to check my back ground.   [end]
[start] Had a similar experience myself. Hired a guy as a temp who claimed to have a 4 year degree. It was not required for the position. He did excellent work and we went to bring him on full-time but during the hiring process our HR was unable to verify his degree. Long story short he lied about it to look better on his resume, but again it wasn't required for the position.  Our company had the policy that any lies on an application or resume was an instant disqualification from employment. The lie did not help him in the slightest and he was an excellent employee.. but there was nothing I could do to save him after the background check. [end]
[start] This whole thread feels like a bad episode of suits  [end]
[start] Oh and don’t have someone skype in as you for the remote technical interview. We will know when you arrive for the job and suddenly don’t seem to recall all that wonderful knowledge you were dazzling us with at the interview. [end]
[start] >his professor is a listed reference. We call that reference.  I think I see the problem here… [end]
[start] The guy better be posting on r/tifu some time soon.  [end]
[start] "They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard." [end]
[start] Lesson 1 of real life: no one cares where you went to college.  People will hire someone from a Junior College if they have the right skills. [end]
[start] I'd say the lesson here is don't lie laterally. [end]
[start] I have had a long and successful career but did not have a degree.  Most employers thought I had a degree because I spent four years at a decent university.  My resume never claimed I had the degree; it just claimed I was in the program for four years.  If they assume wrong, that is on them.  I have since competed a degree, but that was at the age of 42 and long after my career had peaked. [end]
[start] I've never lied on my resume. I understand the mentality that if companies are going to decieve you you can lie to them, but it just seems like a very entitled thing to do.   What because you don't want to have to put in the ground work to get a good job you feel you're entitled to skip past all of the people that put in years of hard work and then just fake it til you make it on the job.      [end]
[start] Had a guy apply who was "Dr. Somebody," which was a little odd. We asked him was his PhD was in. "Philosophy," he said. This was not a requirement for anything in programming, but one of the interviewers minored in philosophy. He asked him some basic philosophy 101 questions and the applicant didn't know. This led down a path where we found out he was probably lying about a lot of things. He was not hired.  [end]
[start] Not to be “that guy” but I’m curious what the actual risk were to the applicant in your story. It seems he suffered little consequence minus a minor setback compared to your setback. [end]
[start] Even more basic...don't lie. [end]
[start] There was this story of this person in the news. She works at a hospital as a nurse for many years and retires from nursing. When she passes away they discover that it was not a he but a she, and the daughter actually is not his biological daughter. Never had the training to be a nurse. The husband that he was married for many many years could not believe it either. The husband never thought twice when he orchestrated/faked the whole birth. Then they track down the person he had stolen the identity from still alive and she had nothing to do with nursing either. So yeah... [end]
[start] Let's add DO NOT LIE WITH YOUR REFERENCES You won't get the job if your reference says they don't know you and have never heard of you.  [end]
[start] True the only lie I have on my resume well atleast online is in my skills i have mentioned teamwork and leadership , being served and done both during my experience one thing I omitted from mentioning for these skills is how I achieve it.. but alas I think omitting part of the truth is acceptable as long as you do not do harm. [end]
[start] I'm a firm believer in "fluffing" your resume, but flat-out lying is a clear no no.  It's ok to exaggerate things, but you can't lie about having certifications, degrees, jobs.  [end]
[start] A former boss I had, I'll call him by his initials, KW, was a mentally abusive thief and liar. He stole everything, including time he'd claim he was at work, but actually was at home watching movies.   I got him fired for egregious thefts, but because he was SUCH a great liar, he convinced all those up top who adored him that I had been the one lying and stealing and manipulating evidence (Which I could never do and live with myself. He was just a conscienceless liar.)  So he was given the option to 'quit or get fired', he picked quit, gave all the employees a BS story about going back to college to get a degree  in 'computers'.  Every now and then I'll google him, to see if he's been busted yet for MAJOR league embezzlement, (so I can join the prosecution as a witness- revenge for this abusive, lying thief for setting  me up to make it look like I was the malefactor.  I ended up getting railroaded out of that shithole by the higher ups that were pissed I'd dare impugn such a bright up and comer whom they adored. One of them told me to my face I was a liar, and I had tampered with evidence (the evidence he'd tampered with.)  Fuck them.  Anyway, I pulled up his LinkedIn, he's STILL lying about his glorious achievements, claiming his career at this shithole Midwest university we both worked at had been so glowingly rosy, that the year he was told to quit or get fired, he had himself winning a high award for outstanding performance. Yeah lol, an academy award for acting, maybe. Not the award he claimed credit for, that he never won.  Once a liar, always a liar, and probably worse- if they go the extra mile and fake documentation, that's a dirty guy indeed.   Holding high moral standards intact doesn't mean 'starving in the gutter', you drama queen. It means being able to live with myself. Sure I'll never make as much as that asshole thief, but I'm not out my ass in credit card debt and shit that's not mine, only borrowed till I pay it off. Life is very, very good for me...  [end]
[start] Now, when you say   >IT. IS. NOT. WORTH. IT.  You mean "You might lose the job you wouldn't have gotten in the first place"? That's the big "its not worth it!!!!!" consequence?  In your specific situation, yes, he would have gotten the job without lying because your company, specifically, was desperate. Do you want to know why he was lying to begin with? Probably because his real resume wasn't getting any traction.  The same thing happened to me. I spent over a year submitting my resume everywhere, with only one interview and no call back to show for it. I tried multiple difference approaches too, none of them had any success. However, manipulating my resume to match the unnecessarily high requirements on job openings, and having a shady friend or two that were willing to be fake references, got me THE. FIRST. JOB. THAT. I. APPLIED. FOR. My experience? My new company loved me. Told me multiple times that I was perfect and that they wish they could have found me sooner. When I quit, they begged me to stay, or at least come in occasionally as a consultant. This is the same job that would not have looked at my real resume twice, much less spoke to me in person.  I've gone on to submit my not-real resume twice more, BOTH times getting the job on the first try. I'm in my current employment for over 7 years now, and it's the perfect job for me.  It was worth it.  EDIT: Keep it mind, I'm talking simple office work, not rocket science or brain surgeon. [end]
[start] He’s just kind of right where he started, didn’t gain or lose anything.  [end]
[start] Don’t lie because it’s fucking wrong. How about that? [end]
[start] > We work with hazardous materials and a four year degree in a relevant field is required.   How does a college degree help someone understand Material Safety Data Sheets? Environmental and regulatory management isn't very complicated as long as you can read.  Perhaps college graduates understand how to read interest rates post-graduation, ergo understand regulatory compliance and storage? That's probably what you're hiring for here.   Your company can't find people because your requirements sound sort of ridiculous unless the role pays $130,000 to help a college graduate pay off their loans. [end]
[start] He don’t get the job cuz of something so trivial Does it really matter if he lied to which uni he went to????? You can’t be that desperate to fill the position!!!! [end]
[start] This is one of the rare circumstances where lying on a resume backfired. Basically your worst case scenario is not getting the job...which you wouldn’t get if you were honest.  Usually not a big risk. [end]
[start] I am disturbed by how many people in this thread are saying it's ok to lie and that you SHOULD lie because the job market is inherently unfair and your have to look out for yourself.  Just because the world is unfair doesn't mean you are allowed to be a bad person! [end]
[start] I used to help write resumes for people, and there was more than one person I “encouraged” to stretch the truth a bit.   In a scenario where you’re just trying to help someone get into a steady call center job and their resume shows 6 fast food jobs in the last 14 months with gaps in-between, there’s no chance they’ll ever get hired anywhere useful.   The advice for this guy was to pick the place where he’d worked for 3 months and just claim that he’d been there for a year. Then I was adamant that he take his next job and that he stayed there for an actual year no matter what, so that he had a legit year some place to go with his fibbed year.   I’m unsure if he followed through or not, but I know for certain that even the most “blue collar” jobs that have relative stability won’t hire someone who bounces from multiple jobs in a single year, so the lie was just to get him on the right path.

[start] My friend's older brother completely fabricated his resume straight out of high school and got a job with Intel, high pay + company car + company housing + free meals in the company cafeteria...he did eventually get caught and fired but he worked there for six years first.   [end]
[start] This should be echoed over in /r/marketing where the majority of people think it's okay to lie a little bit on a resume. I made a comment about how much that was frowned upon and got down voted to Oblivion.  [end]
[start] My previous job was at a cell phone repair store and within the last year or so we had an interview where the applicant said he had lots of experience with cell phone repair. Specifically he stated he had a lot of experience with apple and the iPhone 6. Part of the interview was had people do a quick take apart on a practice phone (so just a dead board or something but all the screws are there).   Now we didn't expect people to be perfect it was more to get an idea of their experience and to degree how well they could figure out getting into the phone. Of course if you claimed to have experience with an iPhone we'd expect they'd be quicker and not need as much, of any help.   Guy took a long time, way too long for someone who "regularly" opened iPhones. Completely green candidates had opened them up faster. And it wasn't just nerves or not having done it for awhile, it was obvious he didn't know what he was doing at all. Which it's a bit of a weird and acquired skill, but the fact that he liked about his experience meant there was no offer for him.  [end]
[start] I’ve got a great story for this. I work at a valuation firm (valuing properties for people usually for the bank so they can get loans etc). Basically an experienced valuer sometimes has a cadet with them, as in someone studying the relevant degree at uni and goes on the road with them learning from the valuer. Anyway a cadet, let’s say his name was Peter, was hired who claimed to be studying and was a year in with 3 to go.  His mentor was an older guy, Jon* who was really lovely but really naive. They were together for 3 years and became friends to the point where Jon lent Peter over 10 grand for a holiday.  Peter’s approaching graduation bar a couple of exams and he voiced he wasn’t confident. The regional manager found out and told him not to worry, he will come down Friday (a 4 hour drive) and give him a hand with his coursework. Well the day comes and Peter has resigned Thursday night, phone disconnected never to be heard of again. My work investigated and found out Peter was never even enrolled at university and faked the whole thing. Jon also out of pocket 10k.  anyway I guess in this case you can get away with it sometimes, but it will always catch up.  [end]
[start] Eh my brother faked it on his resume and he makes 3 figures now in marketing. Sometimes you just gotta get your foot in the door.  Edit: I’m leaving the mistake and [blaming this lol](https://imgur.com/a/0CGh7QZ) [end]
[start] He was qualified for the job ,had a degree in the field but from a different school but you didn't give him the job because he lied about what school he got his degree from . Does your company realize how stupid they are for just letting him go? You mentioned you couldn't just hire any guy they needed certain requirements . He had those requirements met but lied about his school. The smart thing would of been to give him the job and let him work to see if he is good at it. If he wasn't you had an easy reason to let him go which was he lied on his resume. You know how many people get degrees from university and have others do the work for them? I would of given him a shot at least if the position isn't that easy to fill. [end]
[start] So let me get this straight. He has the qualifications and made a little fib about which school he acquired them from. You having wasted probably 10 minutes having to phone a second institution in order to verify fire said employee for such an egregious inconvenience. Am I getting this right? [end]
[start] That's so unfortunate. Any new applicants? [end]
[start] *laughs in CHMM* [end]
[start] How much does GPA matter to you? [end]
[start] Don't lie on your resume *at a place where they're likely to verify it :^)  [end]
[start] I have a degree in Environmental Science with a Minor in Biology  OSHA 40-Hour HAZWOPER Certification (Routinely updated)  Licensed Registered Environmental Health Specialist  Experience working with Industrial Hygienists in the field and in the office [end]
[start] What's the position. I'll for it for ten percent less. Maybe for 3.50. [end]
[start] So.... You're still hiring? =)  [end]
[start] Inverse argument. When an employer advertises a job as entry level, but requires anywhere from 3-7 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, what are actual entry level applicants  (who are attempting to enter the business for experience) supposed to do?   Every time an employer wants to waste my time advertising a job incorrectly, I’m going to attempt to waste their time applying for a job that I’m “not qualified for.”  Employers can quit being shitty anytime with their inflated requirements. And no taking internships, most of which are unpaid, is not a solution. This isn’t the 70’s where students have no monetary responsibility. I have to work 30+ hours a week to pay for shit. [end]
[start] ⁿ [end]
[start] I work in retail, some chick from another store got transferred to my store with "great" experience in everything. Its literally just knowing the registers and stocking. She didn't know to do shit as returns, exchanges, gift cards, or anything but ringing people  up. We all hated her. All she had to do is say idk how to do this. And we'd help her out but no  [end]
[start] I feel like I know this... not as in repost but as in déjà rêvé [end]
[start] You still hiring though? [end]
[start] So what is the job? And where do I apply for it? [end]
[start] Well don't lie as poorly at least. Don't lie about something as checkable as your university, and let your friends know what position they're faking. [end]
[start] Im not sure. I wouldnt do it myself, but I’ve often heard people get away with it to their benefit. If you’re mentally challenged and only vaguely lie like this chode, yeah you deserve to get busted. But if you don’t have a degree and its an entry level spot in a field that isn’t specialized, not really implausible. [end]
[start] What is the field exactly? I'm about to finish my degree in environmental science and I would like to work in hazardous waste management, I'm curious about what this role was and why it's in such high demand.  [end]
[start] I work in the medical and I know A LOT of people who lied on there resume and been working 10 plus years. I understand where your coming from and I'm not saying it's a good idea to lie. But just like a lot of people do check that kinda stuff. A LOT of people also don't check that stuff .  [end]
[start] Oh shit, I changed my first / middle name completely a couple of years after graduating. I hope that’s not why I’m not hearing back from any of my applications... [end]
[start] Okay, this may be crazy, but did you ever consider still hiring him? Would the windfall from hiring him be worth the value gained by filling the position by someone who fulfilled every other requirement? [end]
[start] If youre were really desperate you could have told him you found out he lied on his resume and offer him the same job with less pay. [end]
[start] What certifications did he have and which did he need, if you don't mind? I'm thinking of getting back into that field. [end]
[start] Lmao I know people who have struggled to find a job or at least a decently paid job with the CV and qualifications they have got. As soon as they started lying (stretching the truth) they started getting a lot luckier and now, two of them are earning more than me. They swear by it and tell everyone to lie (stretch the truth a lot) on their cv because their number 1 reason is .... What have you got to loose... Oh you might not get the job...but you'll have a real hard laugh telling all your mates about the it while having a drink in a bar.... What have you got to gain..... 6k extra a year or whatever kinda pay rise you are trying to go for...   Truth is. 1.Reward out ways risk  2.At least that proves you got some big bollocks being able to keep a straight face while spouting shite. 3.Makes a real good story while having a drink with mates about how you got that job you should never have really got... Solidifying you as a legend among your peers.  Me personally have never had to lie on my CV as I have never really struggled to find a job, but I do not hate on those that do.  Moral of the story I suppose is that if every company did appropriate checks people would stop lying. as long as it keeps being this easy to get away with people will keep abusing the system..    [end]
[start] for everyone one busted, one gets through lying on their resume.  i would say even less than 50% actually bother calling ref's etc. [end]
[start] Just out of curiosity, is there any legal trouble one could get into by lying on their resume?  [end]
[start] I think you mean be smart about it and cover your tracks. Have smart friends who will pretend to be made up amazing references. If your gonna lie about something so big you better do your follow up work.  [end]
[start] Don’t lie on your resume unless you work in the entertainment industry because no one checks. I went to a four-year school then went to film school and wasted all that money when my friend lied on his resume started earlier and is now further along than me. This came up one time with the people we work with and it’s somewhat of a running joke now, all they care about is you can produce the goods.   [end]
[start] Is it hazwopper and what city are you in? I’ll apply  [end]
[start] Ok so what is the risk in this case?  i can see your point of he would have got the job anyway and that is fine for well educated people who dont really need to make themselves look super educated but what is your rationale for someone like....  I leave school with few to no qualifications and go to work in a manual field, earning minimum or close to minimum wage..i get lots of experience and do ok getting a few more £$ per hour over the next 10 years..however, to progress in my field to some kind of manager i would need to have a degree, if going to college or university was not on the cards would you suggest i consider myself lucky with my lot or lie on my resume? [end]
[start] ... Unless you're an executive. A guy did this at a job and when his boss was informed he said he liked the guy and to forget about it.  [end]
[start] There are so many more stories of people severely lying on their resume and getting away with it [end]
[start] Do what ever it takes to get that job.  Everyone gets on the job training after they begin.  Your degree and experience are great, but you will learn what you need after you are hired.  Not even joking.  Your new employer will train you.  100% [end]
[start] this sounds a lot less like "dont lie on your resume" and a lot more like "appropriately screen applicants", to be honest.  [end]
[start] Like Bull Dog Bill Clinton said, “it depends on what the definition of ‘lie’ is” [end]
[start] There's a valid counterpoint to this sentiment. It will not apply for all positions, but it will for many. Many job postings have unrealistic expectations for employment, often requiring extremely rare certifications or qualifications, or years of experience in a specific industry doing something extremely specific. I for example work as a Business Analyst for a major company, and I was hired on with no experience as a Business Analyst, and I've been turned down for jobs that pay over 10K more a year than I currently make for being "too overqualified", yet I've also been turned down for hundreds of positions making less even though I know full-well that I could perform the job in question above and beyond requirement. It's not even consistant. I can manage multi-million dollar projects for a major company, yet I can't be hired on to manage a simple Excel document because the job requirement is that I have a minimum of 10 years experience in a specific industry working with 5 different formats of datasets, even though the only one they'll ever use is Excel.  &#x200B;  So what do you do? Our resumes are automatically embellished. Not doing so will most assuredly guarantee you a spot in the unemployment line. What did you ACTUALLY do at your last position? "Oh, well I calculated and managed business collaborations including but not limited to ownership, risks, workflow, and the streamlining of data processes."     Bullshit, you had a few Skype meetings, jotted down some info into an Excel document, and made some phone calls. You just can't say that on your resume, because using all that ridiculous business lingo helps you sound more hireable. I make a good income, and there's not a corporate job that I couldn't do that doesn't require specific knowledge in a technical aspect such as a specific form of coding, or engineering (and I know several coding forms).     They could promote me tomorrow to an executive level management position and quadruple my salary and I'd be successful. But they won't, because I don't have 15 years of experience, "managing scaling protocols in corporate sectors, specifically within the management distribution of computer migration enterprises of projects within financial scopes of over 9 million dollars".     What's that mean? It means that when people ask you if the email template you wrote sounds good, you tell them yes, then you move on to the next item, and when your boss comes down on you for something, you come down on somebody else for an explanation which you then give to your boss. I'm not even kidding--that's about it in a nut shell. Half of the executives we work with don't really even know what's going on in their own projects, because they're not project managers--they're just in charge over the project managers.  &#x200B;  It seems to me that hiring is in no small part about how much someone subjectively likes somebody else, and promoting is in no small part about mostly the same thing, coupled with time at a given company, or in a given industry. I've seen more incompetence in my life (at 37) in the general workforce throughout my experiences than I care to accept is real. I've had bosses so incompetent that I could have run circles around them, yet watched them make double my income because they had 15 years experience being incompetent.  &#x200B;  I used to date a woman for example who was demoted, and dropped from a salary of over 200K a year to 100K, and I KID YOU NOT, this is absolutely true--they did it albeit her ACTUAL verifiable metrics being as high as they could be (she was in the company's top bracket of performance out of 3 brackets), because her boss classified to the company owner that, "she felt that she wasn't living up to expectations."     It was an opinion not backed with even a shred of objective data, and it was, and continues to be, both disgusting, and a terrible way of handling business. Sometimes I feel like many of these big companies can only exist because they squander money so much. I've seen people making over 50K a year sit around doing absolutely nothing for months on end and getting paid to do it, while I'm sitting there thinking of a hundred ways we could be a million times more productive. These businesses wouldn't last if they didn't have such a large surplus of money to blow. I am completely convinced of this. Without a huge surplus, companies would die off because the majority of them waste so much money it's insane. [end]

But it’s important to remember that before the massacre, there was little outcry from the media establishment that such free speech was racist, insensitive or inflammatory.  It appears that this quote, though you picked it up from [Trump's website](http://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/donald-trump-and-the-end-of-free-speech), was actually from [Newsmax writer Christopher Ruddy](http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/chris-ruddy-trump-free/2015/07/08/id/653948/).

The real focus should be on Clinton and Trump."      I'll be honest with you, because I have been so far.  I support Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States.  My goal is to see him elected to the highest office in the land.  Many have given up hope that he can win, I have not.  Until what time as I feel that my support is no longer useful to him and his campaign, he will have my support.      This thread was written in response to a theme that I have seen cropping up quite a bit, the notion that, because Senator Sanders is challenging the establishment, and Donald Trump is challenging the establishment, they are equally appealing to a voter who is challenging the establishment.  Indeed, if you take the time to browse /r/The_Donald/new/ you'll see many voters, claiming to be former supporters of Senator Sanders, introducing themselves to the clan.  Er, crowd.  Introducing themselves to the crowd.  It is my concern that many of these people are leaving Sanders because they believe in the *Trump persona.*  That latinos love him, African Americans love him, he's not race baiting, he's just politically incorrect, he's always a winner with the best women and the best walls and the best words, and that's all they know.  I wanted to provide a clear contrast for *those* Redditors, the ones who only know the persona, not the man.      "So why not make the contrast with Secretary Clinton instead?  Shouldn't you be trying to convince *your* supporters that *she's* the better choice?"      Yep.      Let me start by saying something that is terribly politically incorrect within the walls of Reddit: I respect Secretary Clinton.  I respect her service to this nation as Secretary of State, I respect her service to the people of New York when she was a Senator.  And despite what the past eight years of Republican campaigning would have me believe,  I do not think that she is three honey badgers in a woman suit.  Yes, I am disappointed that she didn't support gay marriage a decade ago, but she supports it now, and unless she's going to overturn the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States of America that legalized gay marriage, it doesn't matter now.  Our friends on the Right can forgive their politicians for lying, stealing, prostitution, gay prostitution, posting naked selfies on Gawker, and cheating on their wives with a stolen gay prostitute.  From Gawker.  I *think* we can forgive Secretary Clinton for being wrong a decade ago.  All that being said, she's not my candidate.  My candidate is Bernie Sanders.  I agree with his positions, I agree with his policies, and I agree with his plans.  He is the person I want to see elected, and I still have hope.      Truthfully, as a Sanders supporter, I just can't write 40,000 characters explaining why we should all switch to Hillary Clinton.      (The original post turned out to be exactly 40000/40000 characters!  I feel like I should get a little Steam pop-up.)  There may come a time when I need to write that post, when I need to try to explain to Reddit that "No, Hillary Clinton is not more dangerous than Donald Trump with access to the nuclear launch codes."  This is not that time, not yet.  However, the comments section is doing an *excellent job* of having that conversation themselves, and I hope it continues going forward.      Also: If a member of /r/HillaryClinton, or even /r/KasichForPresident for that matter, wants my help or insight I would be pleased to offer it.  I may not have the knowledge, or the heart, to defend your candidate, but I'm always happy to help you fight Donald Trump.  (If, and when, they write their posts, I would encourage my fellow cucks to upvote it, whether you support Kasich, Clinton, or Bernie.  And be helpful if you can.)    Seriously, there's tons of shit out there.  My post didn't even touch on social issues, things like women's health (DT: Defund Planned Parenthood), a woman's right to choose (DT: Overturn RvW), immigration (DT: THEY'RE COMING FROM *KENYA!*), gay marriage (DT: Traditional marriage, four of them so far), religious liberties (DT: I'LL STOP ALL THE MUSLIMS FROM *KENYA!*, Favorite Book=Bible), maritime law (DT: I have the best boats.  [I don't know what maritime law is, Ed.]), or if we faked the moon landing (DR: China. Hoax. Done. #winning).      Just don't forget the points in the original post.  I don't care (too much) about attribution, I just want as many people as possible to know that Donald Drumpf is a liar and a con-man.  Democrats and Liberals know how dangerous he could be, and Republicans and Conservatives can see how their base is being played like a fiddle.  We all lose, left, right, and center, if we elect a liar and a con-man to the office of President.  Also Mexico, who, lest we forget, is literally one of our closest trading partners.  Everyone loses.  Even the geese.      Edit 5:  Are we live!?  Flip it, we'll do it live! [end]
[start] >America isn't in the best place right now. Far from the country our parents remember, our America has rampant income inequality, unemployment, citizens who cannot afford to pay their medical bills or their student loans.   The America my parents remember included segregated schools, drafts for Vietnam, overt racism and sexism, etc... It doesn't do us any good to look at the past through rose colored glasses. Things are much better now than they were. They aren't perfect, and there is a lot of room for improvement, but lets not kid ourselves that things were better back then.   [end]
[start] Thanks for the post. Unfortunately, I'm inclined to think that you'll just end up preaching to the choir for the most part. The crux of Trump is that he doesn't care what he says and contradicts himself constantly. People who swallow his rhetoric and make excuses for his waffling stances on issues won't see the above facts as anything worth reading. He has tapped into the hate, racism, bigotry, misogyny, and xenophobia that has been peddled and crammed down people's throats for the past 8 years of Obama's administration. Because of this, I imagine that a lot of people are voting based more so on emotion (read: anger) and because of the confident persona he's created as being an "outsider" to politics. Never mind that he's completely unqualified and is essentially a buffoon. We're at a point in time now where a large portion of our country is poorly educated and unable to think critically on issues that affect their well-being and their futures. This is a large part of why he's gotten as far as he has. Demagogues like Trump come in with easy answers, appeal to emotion, and give short, clipped speeches with confident bravado about making the country great again.  Honestly, what he's created frightens me because even if he doesn't win, there will be a lot of angry momentum that's built up. We're already seeing violence at his rallies and a cold disregard for the "other". Those qualities that makes America great, so to speak--patriotism, hypermasculinity, Christian values--are, according to him under attack and he has no qualms about touching that nerve on the people it affects the most. There's a lot of misplaced anger that's being directed at the marginalized instead of those who are actually the root of the problem, people like Trump himself. It makes me sad to see so many people embracing his message but it's no surprise that there still remains a lively undercurrent of bigotry and xenophobia in this country. It's always been there and will always be there. I just fear the consequences of it being so openly accepted and indulged.  Anyway, I will step down from my soapbox. Thanks again for putting this together. You should post on Facebook or something, try to get it going around. [end]
[start] After reading so many of these comments, I have to wonder, where have all these anti-establishment voters been for the past 15 years? Bernie Sanders gets into the game (also, running as a democrat, so he's part of the machine) and suddenly everyone's Noam Chomsky, railing against establishment with fervor. I think it's fantastic that people are seeing that system is rigged. There's no doubt that this country needs a civic and political awakening. The problem is that we're having that awakening and there are so many people who are ill-equipped with bad information to make it anything worthwhile. Really, to believe any politician in this moment when they say they aren't part of the establishment is just willful ignorance. Again, Bernie's great, but he's running as a democrat. He knew it was the best chance for him to gain traction, but if he railed against the democratic base and split voters from Hillary, there's a good chance he would've paid the price politically after his eventual defeat.  Everyone remarks that Hillary is just too establishment and that they couldn't possibly vote for her. Where was that anger when Obama ran a second time? I understand that one can argue that this election is the time to change that, and that's fair. But Bernie won't get the nomination, and Trump, whether you like it or not, is establishment. Just because he has no experience in politics doesn't automatically make him the man for the job. My fear is that a lot of Bernie voters will end up voting for Trump just because they don't like Hillary. If you voted for the lesser of two evils in the past, what's stopping you now?  The truth is that the system needs an overhaul that won't come from the top down, but the bottom up. Long-term and sustained mass movements are what will do that. Also, focusing on local and state elections will help that process along. Voting for someone even as progressive as Bernie won't bring substantive change and voting for Trump won't bring good change. If nothing else, consider that we're at a dangerous point in time ecologically. I'm not a fan of Hillary, I like Bernie and would like to see him in the White House but know he can't do a ton, and think Trump would be a disaster, but in the end I want someone who at least believes the fact that climate change is real and needs a response. I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, it's how we got in this mess in the first place, but if I have to do it again I will. To buy time while we get our act together, if nothing else. [end]
[start] TL;DR! Not murican myself. Who the fuck would even consider trump over sanders? [end]
[start] While I agree with most of what you've had to say about Trump, I wish you dug a little deeper into Sanders as well. While his positions are ideal and well-meaning, they are not without their flaws. In many cases, he is just as vague as Trump and doesn't give a clear method to what he plans to do. When he does give a clear plan, he often forgets to account for very crucial variables. Trump is definitely not an alternative to Sanders, their similarities start and end at the fact they're party outsiders. But I can't help but feel like this post is a little biased for what is supposed to be a comparison.  Still, very informative post, and thank you for putting it together! [end]
[start] Where did the post go? [end]

[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I think this is a great post and very informative.  My concern is that none of this is new information. The people that are supporting Trump aren't lacking awareness of these positions. They either don't care or have rationalized them and accepted them.  ... and I know this isn't very nice, but when you look at the content of r/The_Donald and pro-trump comments throughout this website, facebook, twitter, etc... none of those resources indicate those people are the type to sit and read a ~10,000 word post about the downsides of Donald Trump.  It is important to share this info though, so I'm glad OP posted it. Even if 33% of Sanders supporters either abstain, vote 3rd party, or vote Trump, Hillary still wins the general... by a lot. [end]
[start] OP, bless you for this post.  [end]
[start] Holy shit, nice post dude! [end]
[start] How do you go from supporting Sanders to a guy that thinks we should "call up Bill Gates to shut (the internet) down" so terrorists can't do terror.  Literally the dumbest motherfucker that ever ran for President.    [end]
[start] Yep. Sanders is the perfect candidate. Trump is the worst.  The thing is, if you give Hillary the presidency, then you let the national democratic convention think that that's what people want. Fuck that. I'd rather take 4 years of Trump than 8 years of Hillary, knowing that the DNC isn't going to bring forth a nominee against Hillary for her re-election, like how Sanders commented that someone should run as a democrat against Obama in 2012.  Regardless, I'm going to just vote for Sanders in the general even if he's not the democratic nominee, and even if he's not running independent. [end]
[start] Wow.  Can this please be a sticky in /r/politics? [end]
[start] Post has been removed.  Anyways, I think the best anti-Trump argument, that gets zero traction around here sadly (or anywhere in the US?) is that American elections don't happen in a vacuum.  I'm not American, and what I'm seeing is that Sanders is an unknown on the international scene, Clinton is seen as a good international leader, Trump is seen as a douchenozzle and a clown.  Obama built Americas international status back up after the Bush jr years which were a problem (not because of the guy but because of some of the policies). Obama might have been overall not that different from Bush on international policy, but he managed to make America look better from the outside.  If Trump is elected, all of that goes down the toilet. And I mean, the day after the election, every nation on earth is going to look at the US like it has cooties. Even if he doesn't push any of his cooky plans. [end]
[start] Current Sanders supporter.  Of all of these points, #2 is the only one I agree with Trump over Sanders.  Net Neutrality - I disagree wholeheartedly with Trump.  I cannot support this line of thought.  Freedom of Speech - I believe that if the second amendment can have restrictions, and the fourth amendment can have restrictions, then so can the first.  I don't disagree with Trump's policy here.  Mistakes are one thing, but I do not oppose punishing writers and companies who knowingly publish false information as if it were fact.  Facts are not subject to interpretation.  Climate Change - I believe climate change is real, but don't feel strongly enough about it as an issue that a politician disagreeing with me on this would individually sway my vote.  Minimum wage - I'd prefer replacing the minimum wage with a basic income, but in lieu of that, leaving minimum wage the same is a horrible plan, and contrary to the notion that he thinks he's planning on creating jobs and growing the economy.  Foreign Policy - I side Sanders heavily here.  I'm sick of our military being the world police and I'm sick of America feeling like we need to intervene in every single political conflict.  Electoral reform - Strongly side Sanders.   [end]

[start] Can we get something like this to show the difference between Hillary and Sanders as well? Would love to share!! Thanks for this awesome piece. [end]
[start] I think of it this way:  If Trump wins we will have 4 years of anarchy.   He's a con man.  He's all over the map.  I disagree with you that he has any policies what-so-ever, just meaningless emotion based rhetoric.  He'll likely run the country like a business and only make safe bets on policy, throwing a few bones to his poor white voters.  After two years the senate and house will likely revert to the Dems as we all freak out that Hitler is our President.  The Republican party will be broken. The final two years of his term will be the lamest of ducks as no one will support him. So two years where Washington gets nothing done.  As for the Supreme court, I don't think his picks will be any better than Hillary's.  Trump simply will not be re-elected.  After a Hillary loss the Democratic party will also be broken.  Here we have a chance to take it over.  2020 hindsight will make 2020 the year we transform this country.  On the other hand if Hillary wins we are guaranteed 8-16 years of Oligarchy.  The low end of that estimate would only happen if Hillary is impeached.  So likely at least 12 years of oligarchy. And even after that there is no reason to believe that the Democratic party is going to change...if Hillary wins the party isn't broken and the establishment will have over a decade to regroup.  If we vote for Hillary we are saying in effect that the Democrats don't actually have to earn our votes.  If they don't have to earn our votes then they don't have to do anything for us.  I will concede that there is a slim chance Hillary could in fact be the change we need.  I just don't like the odds. Everything about her points to the opposite conclusion...*everything*.  So 4 years of anarchy or 12+ years of oligarchy.  That's the hard math many of us are looking at. [end]
[start] I honestly don't believe Trump will do that much damage in his time as president. Let him try to smash things up. The DNC needs to see it happen. They tried to cram a candidate down our throats. They tried to choose for us.  *I would rather let Trump wreck shop for 4 years than allow the establishment to believe they can continue rigging the system.*  What the DNC did to Bernie was a betrayal to voters. I'm not going to look down at my own shoes and say "Ok, you win. Good job stamping out our revolution. I now understand that, in the end, corporate interests get what they want. I'll vote for Hillary." I'm sorry, I won't do it. Let Trump shit all over everything. I hope Hillary and the DNC look upon a landscape covered in shit and realize they did this. This is their fault.  At that point, I hope Hillary gives up. I hope Trumps win will encourage more anti-establishment on both sides, and we'll start seeing some candidates that break the mold. That's not going to happen if we all just swallow this defeat and remain loyal to the party that fucked us over. [end]
[start] For those reading this, this is a key difference between Sanders and Trump. Both of these candidates have gone on record as saying they want to make drastic changes if elected. This is true. Some will point out that Sanders is no more likely to accomplish what he says than Trump, and because of this they don't see a difference between the absurd things Trump says and what Sanders says.   There is a big difference, though. Bernie Sanders is actually genuine when he says he wants single payer Healy care. He has a plan for it. He will make an honest effort to bring it to this country. He actually believes in these things.   Donald Trump not only has no intention of trying to do what he says, he has no plan to do them. He's not genuine when he says he is going to make Mexicans build a wall between Mexico and the U.S.  He knows he's not going to pursue that. What he does know is that if he says it that millions of racists will vote for him. He isn't going to make Putin do whatever either. The braggadocio is empty. He does know that trash talking like this will get the votes of the 'Murica fuck yeah crowd, though. He's already admitted that he would act completely different if elected. He said it. So, the Trump everyone is in love with isn't the guy you would get. He's playing a character. He's admitted that the people are voting for a guy that won't exist if he's elected.  [end]
[start] Just so you know, I think part of the reason the post was removed is the mods try to keep the them of the sub pro-Bernie rather than anti-"candidate." With that being said, there seems to be an unfortunate exception for Clinton the past few months (to the mods credit, they were pretty good at staying on top of that before around the turn of the year). [end]
[start] I don´t like any of the candidates, but I agree with Sandres on Foreing Policy. Every other candidate and Obama seems to think bombs will solve everything. Sandres is the only person that thinks we have alternatives. Trump thinks he can bomb everyone and no one will bomb him back. [end]
[start] Um, I just refreshed the page and you removed it, anyone have a copy? [end]
[start] I cannot find the post. [end]
[start] I cant find this post anywhere, [end]
[start] Stupid mods are stupid. One, not even, shortened link and the whole post is deleted. You must be a Trump supporter if you think that flimsy excuse will get by the rest of the internet. Really, shortened links are banned? Talk about throwing the baby out with the bathwater. [end]
[start] I guess I'll be doing a write-in. [end]
[start] I think the bigger problem here is the two party system which has turned into a duopoly. If sanders does not get the Democratic nomination and it's between hillary and trump I think it's time to put our efforts toward making a third party viable. The passion is on our side and getting a third party viable will go a very long way towards helping democracy in this country than writing sanders in or voting for lessor of two evils (whichever one you think is the lessor evil).  [end]
[start] If America wants to police the world, the world should get some say in who's elected. [end]
[start] Wow.  Can this please be a sticky in /r/politics? [end]
[start] What really upsets me is that why people are voting Hillary over Sanders. In my state, Florida, Hillary is beating Sanders by 30%.   Sanders is our only hope for America to change. I don't know why people are not voting for him instead of Clinton.  [end]
[start] Thank you so much! You informed me really well. I think, for people like me who are not from the US, you made their points of view clear without writing incomprehensibly. It can be hard to get informed on the primaries/caucuses for people who aren't natives because of difficult use of language. Cheers.  [end]
[start] This entire thing should be obvious already, for crying out loud! How can one possibly switch from Sanders to Trump? TOTALLY DIFFERENT policies and points of views. People should get their shit straight and stop being so bitchy about not voting for Hillary. [end]
[start] Thanks for being the first to make me give someone gold. Well thought, well spoken.  As a husband, father of 2 and teacher, I'm very much a Bernie Sanders fan and have my fingers crossed that, by some miracle, he wins the nominations. I've donated monthly, but have yet to phonebank (time/work). My family and I just started spring break, so I believe it's time to break my phonebanking virginity. [end]
[start] Thank you for changing my mind. [end]
[start] [Donand Trump will make anime real!](http://i.imgur.com/7ir01dc.png) [end]
[start] I didn't read this and I will tell you why I didn't read this...  I am not going to choose Trump over Sanders. I would choose Trump over Hillary though. That's kind of the problem you have here.   Why would you compare Trump to Sanders... people who are going to vote for Sanders would vote for Sanders over Trump. That's not the debate. The debate is why should someone on this planet vote for Hillary ever under any conditions. That I can't comprehend, and I doubt any links, articles, or anything else is actually going to sway me on the matter.   On the main issues to me, Hillary and Trump are basically one and the same. Both terrible people. Both dishonest people. Both untrustworthy people. Both corporate people. Both interested in themselves over the public good.  The difference happens to be that Hillary is a known war hawk who takes advice from a known war criminal. So, Trump has that advantage.  Hillary is in bed with every possible corporation known to man and is likely going to sell us out the moment she can. Trump is self serving, so we don't really know what he would do.   Frankly, this election cycle has killed the little enthusiasm I had for politics because it's a joke. MSM controls the narrative and a lot of people are too stupid to realize when very rich and powerful people are feeding them bullshit so as to keep them in line. Regardless, I have come to the conclusion that Trump is the president America deserves because America is full of very stupid selfish people. [end]
[start] You're right. Vote Green instead. [end]
[start] I think you're missing the point.   The point isn't to compare Sanders with Trump, it's to compare Hilary with Trump. If you're stuck with a vote for evil or a vote for evil, why vote for the lesser evil? She isn't going to solve any issues, she's just in it for herself and her accomplices and that's clear as day.  If the DNC's establishment is so sure that progessives will vote for their not-progressive candidate because it's the only choice they're given, the progressives might as well give the DNC the biggest "fuck-you" imaginable by voting for the one who isn't pretending to be progressive.   If you know you're gonna *have* to eat a shit sandwich, maybe you prefer a bite of the one that doesn't have a "I'm chocolate, honest! Trust me, chocolate here." label on it. [end]
[start] In 1962, John F. Kennedy famously said, "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."  I am an independent. I have been active and donated for Bernie's cause. I will vote for Bernie if he's the candidate.   If he's not I will vote along with my party: the American people. The majority of Americans are independents. The reason we are not affiliated is because the entire corrupt system is the opposition, not any particular candidate.  In this case the violence will not be from those seeking the change, it will be from those who have been sold by a circus act on believing they will get change. There will be a violent revolution in the system.  A vote for Trump is a vote for that revolution in the political system, not in the streets. Let's see what four years of getting what they wanted does to the actual Trump supporters. Let's see what four years of impotence on the world stage does for both the system and for the actual Trump supporters.  Let's see if we, the independents, can choke them to death with their own greed and stupidity.  Fuck the system. Let it burn.   [end]
[start] Isn't Trump also wanting to defund K-12 public education, remove EPA restrictions on business, and do away with obamacare as well as reverse laws that will help in creating insurance monopolies?  These are very important things that should be included in this post as they're huge items.  [end]
[start] I haven't read this post (it was removed by the time I got here) but that fact that it was removed is very disconcerting.  Can anyone explain?  Did OP violate a rule? [end]
[start] In the early days of his campaign, I used to call Trump a clown and a buffoon.  It's worse. He's a rabble-rousing demagogue, and my prediction is that that's going to end in someone's death before his campaign is over. [end]
[start] I appreciate the incredible efforts you put into this post. But, the fact of the matter is, in a general election of Clinton v. Trump, I will have to make concessions on the lesser of two evils. Bottom line is Trump couldnt fuck things up so bad and if he's lowsy, he's out in one term. Then we can have a chance at a revolution. With Clinton you get 8 more years lies.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] There are people voting Trump while not believing anything he says regarding policies or facts.  It is like Poe's Law is in effect. Satire can appeal to both sides of the same coin (assuming you think Trump is purposefully being a Poe in order to garner votes, at least most of the time).  Democrats who vote Trump do so because they know EXACTLY what Hillary stands for (btw, everything she has said in the later and later stages of the primaries have become more and more bullshit, because she is just copying Bernie's agenda when it suits her), and so they'd rather roll the dice, let the system be chaotic for 4 years while both parties rebuild themselves, rather then let the establishment continue to degrade American liberties and expand economic inequalities. [end]
[start] I think this is where you find out /r/thedonald  is pretty much all trolls having fun with the circus that is Trump's campaign. [end]
[start] Jesus Christ....that someone could support Sanders and think "but y'know Trump has some good ideas" boggles my mind. [end]
[start] I know you're right it's just that it's disheartening to know what my remaining options are. It's a bitter pill to swallow and, in all honesty, I need some time to not feel so apathetic and disappointed in US politics.   Out of all the people in America we're left with another Clinton or Trump. How has America come to this? [end]
[start] I, for one, haven't seen or heard about Sanders supporters switching to Trump. I hope that's a fluke and not the norm. [end]

When I read what you wrote about Trump, I kinda fear for it all. [end]

[start] I read what you wrote and I understand where you're coming from. I'm still voting Trump if I can't vote for sanders and here's why: The establishment has proven time and time again that they are NOT looking out for our best interests. Our politicians are bought and paid for through and through. There is absolutely no denying that. Whether its a republican or a democrat it really doesn't matter-- The middle class will continue to shrink. The poor will continue to get poorer. The rich will continue to get richer. Wages will never keep up with inflation. Wars will continue. etc etc. The reason i'm voting for Trump is because it's something different. I might not agree with the guy on most things but at least he's a giant fucking wrench tossed into the gearbox of american politics. It's something different. And for there to ever be a change for the good someone like Trump or Sanders has to come along and either make it better (Bernie) or completely fuck it up (Trump)-- Or vice versa. Who knows. [end]
[start] deleted   [end]
[start] You wrote a lot about the differences between Sanders and Trump. I'd like to first say I like Sanders more than any other candidate and will vote for him if he wins the primary.   However, I think you did not achieve your proclaimed goal of being as unbiased as possible.   Firstly, every issue you've highlighted is painted in favor of Sanders and against Trump. Is it possible there are issues that they agree on? Is it possible that Trump holds positions that would be more favorable than Sanders to some liberal voters? Surely Sanders has some ideas that aren't in fact great (isolationism?).   The biggest thing that got me was how you painted Trump as anti free speech by highlighting all of his lawsuits against people. The biggest problem is that the first amendment protects you from government censorship. If you call my mom fat and I pop you in the mouth, that's not violating your first amendment rights (though it is violating your right to not be punched in the face.) Similarly if you say something about Trump and he sues you for libel, that's still not violating your first amendment rights. It's taking the matter to a court of law to see if YOU violated Trump's right to not be slanderized or libeled.  [end]
[start] As for your comment about international commentators not having any business commenting on American politics: I think it would be safe to say our countries would keep out of your politics if you would just keep your politics out of our countries. [end]

[start] You make a great argument that Sanders is a better choice than Trump.  But the people flipping to Trump are Sanders supporters preparing for the reality that Bernie might lose.  This would be much more persuasive if it was a comparison of Hillary and Trump.  EDIT: my apologies, this was addressed in the comments. [end]
[start] >  It's easy to understand why someone who supports Senator Sanders could see Donald Drumpf as an alternative.   I'm sorry, what? Who in their right mind would go from supporting Sanders to supporting Drumpf? Who goes from Sanders to a thundering, racist incompetent and calls that an easy to understand switch? [end]
[start] Until I read this I didn't even know that Bernie supporters would jump ship if he isn't nominated. For me I haven't voted since W's first term because I felt like I made a huge mistake in who I voted for. But I decided that this time around I would not idly stand by while Drumpf gets elected. so I will vote for Bernie and if he isn't nominated then I guess I will vote for whoever I believe will represent me the best they can.

[start] Could you please include Jill Stein in the alternatives to Trump and a donation link for her?  She is the closest in policy substance and message to Bernie and addresses the same issues that provide Bernie and Trump with a base. [end]

[start] I am voting Trump. Bernie and Trumps foreign policies are extremely similar. The Anti-SJW stuff Trump brings to the table makes it easier.

[start] While it's a good post and I agree with you, I refuse to vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.  [end]
[start] My basic understanding is that the people that are attracted to Sanders/Trump fall into two general categories:   - Those with "much to gain and little to lose" from choosing Trump   - Those with something or much to lose and choosing Hillary as the "safer" or "lesser evil"   In other words Trump is seen as the risky bet (can be pretty good or pretty bad) while Hillary is the safe bet (for sure lose but only a "little").

[start] Sanders has been in Congress for almost 30 years; he's not an outsider. [end]
[start] Excellent write up.  [end]
[start] Thank you for taking the time to post this.  As a Bernie supporter since writing him on the Presidential ballot in 2012, my feeling is that this analysis misses the mark.  I understand that they are wildly divergent candidates in almost every way. I understand the sort of person Trump is, and how his cult of personality is derived. I know his policies would be contrary to my own interests, and to those of many others, and that is why I would vote for him in a general election against Clinton.  Bernie represents what I want in a politician. I believe this country needs policy based on his history and philosophy. I need that same policy too, as a former middle class thirtysomething who now may never own a home, spent 14 years without health insurance, and could never afford to raise a family.   The corporate-money stranglehold on our political process is laid bare by the MSM effort to stymie, ridicule, and ignore the candidate who represents my interests, and those of so many others. Further, the Democratic party has fully endorsed, if not instigated, this bias in spite of the overwhelming social and financial support from empowered voters who may scarce be able to afford it. I myself am too cash-strapped to give, that I could.  The Clinton nomination, in its 'foregone conclusion', is the DNC guarantee of 'more of the same'. Four more years of crony capitalism. Four more years oligarch impunity. Four more years of socialized risk and privatized gains.  So if the DNC is this committed to perpetuating the corruption, then as a citizen, Trump represents the closest I have to a 'nuclear option'.  I wouldn't vote Trump for myself or anyone else. I'd vote Trump because a Trump presidency would likely be a shortcut to the worst-case scenario that Americans need to finally push the reset button on this electoral process.  My hope is to see the reform this government needs. My goal is to contribute to its realization, good or ill, at the voting booth. I believe in Senator Sanders, and I will not mock his legacy by capitulating on my principles. [end]
[start] You'll need to rewrite that at a 5th grade reading level, so the Trump Fluffers will understand it. [end]
[start] This post inspired me to donate to Bernie. [end]
[TITLE] Nurses helped me keep my sex life a secret from my mom when I was in high school. [TITLE]
[start] Nurses are amazing. Thank you for sharing your story.  I am so glad you are well. [end]
[start] Till  this day your mom doesn’t know a thing about it? Yeah, nurses are amazing, not just because of that but also because of their WILL to help someone. [end]
[start] I’m a RN. Years ago I took care of a young woman who had been in a bad accident. I assessed her, and the doctor ordered xrays. After the doctor walked out the girl told me that she might be pregnant and that her boyfriends dad was a radiologist at our hospital. She was mortified for anyone to know.   So, I had her get a urine sample for a pregnancy test. We had to wait for the results before we could take her to X-ray.   Her mom came eventually, and was basically screaming at me because her daughter needed those xrays. I just kept stalling radiology, the mom and the doctor.   Finally the results came back negative and we wisked her off to X-ray. [end]
[start] I'm a nurse. We were taught in nursing school that sometimes we wouldn't get the full truth out of teenagers with parents in the room. Now, when I take my teenager to the dr, I explain to her that I can step out if there's anything she needs to talk to the Dr or nurses about without me. Luckily, she's comfortable enough with me that she tells me everything anyway. And I mean EVERYTHING... [end]
[start] Nurses don't get the credit they deserve like teachers don't either. They are true heroes [end]
[start] This is great. It reminds me of  time when my friend had been hit by her boyfriend, the nurses were able to determine that he needed distracting while I told them what happened. If he had realised we were telling them he’d have kicked off and we needed to keep it all calm so he would leave. Nurses are wonderful. [end]
[start] Nurses are amazing. They tend to always have your back. [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing your story. It brought tears to my eyes.  I have been an RN for 30 years now. I truly love my job. I have had many different jobs within my career...peds, OR, military; I could go on.  The one true thing that has kept my going on the bad (and good!) days is that I want to make a difference is someone's life.  If it is for a brief moment or to last a lifetime, I helped someone.    It is a great and rewarding career. Thank you again for posting and proving my purpose that we can make a difference in someone's life. ❤  Edit: Thanks to the poster for the Silver reward! Much appreciated 😊 [end]
[start] I also get cysts on my ovaries! I went through hell to be diagnosed.. my doctor did so much bloodwork and initially told me I was lactose intolerant. After a few weeks of not eating a single dairy product, I still has horrible pains. I could hardly move. He finally sent me for an ultrasound and they found I had cysts on my ovaries, PCOS.   I've also been a certified nursing assistant for seven years now, one day I'll go back to nursing school. I've met some wonderful nurses who are definitely underappreciated. It's not an easy job like most believe! Nursing staff are usually trained to pick up on things like abuse and actions like your mother showed (not that she's abusive, just that she wasn't overly concerned and wanted to stay whether it made you uncomfortable or not) [end]
[start] Yay,  they sound awesome and I'm glad a bad situation turned out well. [end]
[start] Nurses are the backbone of healthcare, I love them. I’m so happy that they had a way for you to stay safe both with your pain then and there and the pain that your mother could’ve caused if they hadn’t been smart about it. [end]
[start] This is so awesome! Just be careful when it comes to sex. ALWAYS use protection, you don’t want a child in high school [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Nurses are under-appreciated heroes! A great medical plan could not be executed without great nurses. Unfortunately the power of Nursing is only realized with exposure once already in the hospital.   Also there are so many roles in Nursing—Nurse Practitioner, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Clinical Research Nurse, etc. [end]
[start] Nurses are HARD, they don't take shit from anyone [end]
[start] Nurses go through such training to make sure they holistically care for their patients, something that is often taken for granted. I love nurses and I love what they do for those they take care of, because if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't feel the confidence and comfort when I need medical attention. [end]
[start] This honestly my fear to be honest. Mom is hella Christian and expects the same from me. [end]
[start] As a nurse, I’m so happy to hear this :) [end]
[start] Did sexual activity cause the cysts? [end]
[start] nurses are heroes! [end]
[start] Nurses dont get nearly enough credit for what they do and it's a damn shame. [end]
[start] Such professional way of acting. In my country nurses are known to be deeply catholic, so they would've just guilt-tripped like "why don't you want your mom in?? are you hiding something? really suspicious". Also, even though we have a law to give free contraceptives to all females from 15 yo, most nurses judge the girls and actually make them feel guilty about it, making them abandon their appointments. It's disgusting. [end]
[start] Sly like a fox.  Very well played by some wonderful nurses.  Christian morals make me want to vomit.  I was raised in a strict christian family, and it did some serious damage.  The trick is to not go crazy in the opposite direction, don't reject morals, don't dwell in them. [end]
[start] I love nurses too, if Ava wasn't there when I was freaking out from pain meds who knows what I would've done. [end]
[start] When I was In HS I also suffered multiple times from cysts on my ovaries, bursting...worst pain I’ve ever felt. 5 years ago I had my right ovary removed due to major scar tissue. I’m 42 now. Hope you don’t have to endure anymore episodes. [end]
[start] Nurses are the foundation and walls of medicine, good job to those that helped you! [end]
[start] Nurses are angels. I’m glad you had two of them looking out for you. [end]
[start] They do such a great job in sometimes very difficult circumstances. They are so undervalued [end]
[start] That’s a great story. My high school boyfriends Aunt was a LPN and she pulled me aside at a family birthday party to ask if I needed an exam or birth control. We weren’t sexually active but it was cool of her to offer. My mom was really weird about sex too, she really thought I’d stay a virgin until marriage. She stayed up wailing and crying all night after I told her I’d had sex the first time. Needless to say I don’t tell her anything. [end]
[start] I’m a RN and I love this post! It’s a HARD job folks, and hearing stories like this one makes you realize that all the crap we experience is worth it. [end]
[start] Some nurses are so compassionate.  I've had experiences where hospital treatment has been a nightmare. Healthcare is such a complex field.  My parents are the "essential oils and vegetables" type so I'm envious of people who have the privilege of healthcare. [end]
[start] I wish my nurses were all like this.   When I needed birth control for hormones the nurse luckily asked my mom to leave the room while she discussed it with me and then spoke to my mom separately when I started crying over how my mom would react.   But when I had an incident with heavy non-stop bleeding the nurse didn't even check to see if I wanted my mom in the room before asking if I was sexually active... I completely froze up and my mom rage-quit out of the room because she was so embarrassed her daughter was having sex.  I wish it was standard to ask these questions in private. If I wasn't terrified I was having a miscarriage I would've lied that I was sexually active. [end]
[start] I thought you were a male until you said ovaries. This whole post I thought you were keeping you being gay a secret from your mom lol [end]
[start] Man, nurses are the best. I was in hospital once with a very embarrassing and painful issue and had two doctors talking over me in another language - the only reason I knew what they were even discussing was because the nurse took the time to comfort me/explain. I was pretty fucked off with the doctors and immensely grateful to that nurse.  (For the record, this happened in the UK and they were speaking something other than English. If I'd been abroad, I wouldn't have expected everyone to speak English just for my benefit...) [end]
[start] Having been raised by nurses (my mom, my dad, my aunt, my grandmother), I can honestly say they nursed are amazing people and really underappreciated. [end]
[start] Nurses are the reason I don’t believe in God. Because if we’re created in His image, there’s no way that the same guy who made dogs allergic to chocolate could pull of something as amazing as nurses. [end]
[start] Are you from the UK? I can't think of anywhere else besdues there that has an age of consent of 16 [end]
[start] As a nursing student, I’ll try to remember this tactic if I ever come across a patient in this situation. [end]
[start] What did we do to deserve nurses anyway? [end]
[start] My son spent close to a month in the NICU due to respiratory complications and I have to say, I’m not sure who the paediatric Nurses took care of more.. the babies or the parents! Gods, angels, superheroes, mothers - they’re literally all of this and with such genuine, divine compassion. [end]
[start] I'm so sorry you have that kind of person as a mom.  Those nurses are angels. [end]
[start]  Another ER story: a 14 yo girl and her mom came in because the daughter was having severe abdominal pain.   We always draw a pregnancy test (or urine) with the other labs used to try to give us a direction to go with other tests.   Labs came back normal, except the pregnancy test was positive. I showed the results to the doctor, and he asked me if I had told them the result. (Actually not allowed by nurses, we would be practicing outside our scope).   I looked at the doctor and told him that He was the one that got to go into the room and rock their world because he makes the “big bucks” and I make the “little bucks”.    I was very sorry for this family, and I did go in with the doctor to see how he approached it, and then I would be ready for anything that was coming. Anger on the moms part, denial on the daughters part. Crying all around. Nurses can also be referees and comforters. I then spent some time teaching them, and giving them resources. Another night in the ER, where someone’s life is changed forever. [end]
[start] Those nurses are homies, I hope your side got better OP [end]
[start] Omg I had one on my ovaries as well! that pain is no joke and fetal position is the only position to be in standing up straight is not an option!  omg just thinking about it makes me cringe but I’m glad you’re ok!! [end]
[start] This is one of the best things I've heard for a loooong time.  Teamwork to keep the prudes off our back is much welcome.  Gotta hate the jealous controlling type of people. [end]
[start] Thank you for the marvelous story. It’s nice to read a positive experience and understand how those two nurses created a veil of protection between your mother and self.  I am a registered nurse. Talking to other nurses, I paraphrased a line from A Few Good Men. Nurses take care of people “who can’t care for themselves.” I think the majority of nurses want to lessen the physical, emotional or spiritual dis-ease of suffering.  Your experience is a gentle reminder, how importance of small acts of kindness. Glad to hear, you are feeling better! [end]
[start] I mean they often catch the consequences of a doctor’s decision such as too much medicine, a procedure gone wrong, a resident not yet competent at something, a surgeon known for bailing on patients who develop complications and how to help them. Nurses fill in a lot of physician screw ups [end]
[start] As a nurse I have to say thank you from the bottom of an under appreciated and big heart. [end]
[start] Nurses are angels. Full stop. [end]
[start] I had an ovarian cyst the literal size of a football. People in middle school thought I was pregnant. Even the doctor thought I was pregnant ! I kept saying no... I’m not... and he would say yes! Yes you are ! With a giant grin on his face.. my mom noticed our banter and seriously asked if I was and I assured her that I wasn’t and I’ve never done anything that could get me pregnant.... it’s a long story of how I lived with this bulge for sometime and told my mom that it was weird because when I lay dawn I could like move it around and what not. But she didn’t pay attention to it, until I was going to tryout for the basketball team and had to get my physical.  I’m grateful that we caught it early. I was told that it contained excess hair and skin, nail and had toxic fluid and if it were to puncture in any way I could’ve died.   I was never in any pain like you were but I’m glad that you are ok😊 [end]
[start] I have a story, Sort of off topic but My sis and I got into a car accident a few years ago. We were ok, but she was pregnant at the time. Like 3months. My family didn’t know this. The doc came in with his clipboard after some examinations and said “everything seems fine, baby is fine” and my dad and aunt were like “what????” And the doc had an oh shit reaction and left the room. Lol [end]
[start] Reminds me of when I went to planned parenthood for the morning after pill.  The nurse who came in happened to be my aunt. [end]
[start] I had something similar happen at a dentists office. I had a terrible tooth ache, I was about 16 and so off to the dentist me and my mom went.  We stepped in to the exam room and while the dentist loudly talked to my mom, blocking the doorway before she could step in after me his assistant whirled me around and pointed silently to a sign the read ‘are you pregnant or think you might be pregnant?’  I shook my head in equal silence and then the guy went to walk past the doctor, tapping him on the shoulder which I assume was the all clear signal.    I remember thinking how awesome they were about handling stuff like that, and I felt really good about the fact that they were doing their best to protect young women in potentially vulnerable positions. I never forgot it and I never will. [end]
[start] That was so kind and thoughtful of them, gotta love nurses:) [end]
[start] In college I [f] was super sick one time and had a fever and couldn’t stop throwing up. I couldn’t keep any good or liquid down to save my life. The on campus nurse had no idea what was the matter, but said that if it didn’t go away in a few hours that I’d need to go be put on fluids and IVs so I didn’t get even more dehydrated.   My dad, an ER doctor, drive up two hours and took me to an urgent care to get some tests run. While there I allowed him to stay in the room since he clearly would understand what was happening better than me. I was answering questions about my medical health and the food I’d been eating and such when the question “are you sexually active?” came up. Without thinking I answered yes. At the same time I said yes my dad had said no, since he was helping to answer some questions I didn’t know the answer to or couldn’t remember.   Immediately my dad stared at me. He then shrugged, said “I guess yes then” and the nurse who was getting the info laughed.  When the nurse stepped out my dad asked if I was being safe and if I was on any birth control. I said I was using protection but wasn’t on contraceptives. He then said that he’d be putting me on contraceptives as soon as I wasn’t sick.   A few days later after I was better he asked what contraceptive method I preferred and helped me get it.   While I don’t tell my parents everything, it’s nice to know that my dad at least will help if he learns something new. [end]
[start] Have you ever considered writing that nurse a hand written thank you card? Or just sending in a thank you card describing how you appreciated that they went above and beyond to protect your privacy? I bet it’ll make them feel wonderful. [end]
[start] I always wonder why I never got the good ones. I needed an x-ray on my foot to see if it was broken and they came right out into the waiting room in front of my religious dad (and everyone else) and told me I needed to do a urine test to see if I was pregnant. At every doctor’s appointment I went to, I sat quietly while my mom answered everything and took up the conversation. Sometimes I could speak up a little to correct her on what my symptoms actually were, but then she’d basically tell them to ignore what I said. In all of my 18 years of going to doctors, only once was she asked to leave the room so they could ask if I was sexually active and needed help. At that point, I was and since I’d never seen the survey before, answered honestly that I wasn’t treated well at home, that I had a bad relationship with my parents, and they I most certainly couldn’t admit to being sexually active or have access to bc of any kind.   They took all that information and gave me tissues (because I was actually crying when I spoke to them) and then just left. My mom came back in pissed that she had been sent out of her almost adult daughter’s exam and demanded to know everything I can said to them. Nothing changed, actually it all got a lot worse before I found myself kicked out the day after high school graduation. [end]
[start] She is genuinely good at and cares about her job! Minors and young adults need more rights when it comes to their own health and making choices for themselves [end]
[start] I feel this. I can’t tell you how many doctors I lied to throughout high school because my mom REFUSED to leave the room. And if I asked her to I would’ve gotten a mouthful when I got home. [end]
[start] Stuff like this makes me glad to know I made the right decision to go into nursing. Being able to help others, especially in situations like this, make it worth it :) [end]
[start] Nurses are the absolute best! [end]
[start] Could’ve even been from a rape for all the nurses would know. How kind and considerate of them to help you talk privately! [end]
[start] This is awesome [end]
[start] How does sex contribute to ovarian cysts ?  I'm dumb. ELI5. [end]
[start] Wait so the act of fucking your boyfriend somehow gave you ovary cysts? :\ [end]
[start] I blame western society. They don't have any outlet for sexually mature kids so they are forced to fornicate. [end]
[start] It's early in the morning, I thought the title said 'ncurses' instead of nurses and I got really excited that this would be about computers. [end]
[start] What do ovarian cysts have to do with being sexually active? Why’d she ask that? [end]
[start] I’m glad that these nurses were able to remain discreet... but I also have to ask: why is your sexual activity relevant in this scenario? If the nurse suspected you might have PCOS, which I have as well, having or not having sex has nothing to do with whether you get cysts on your ovaries. It is caused by an imbalance of reproductive hormones not sexual activity... A better question to ask would have been ‘how regular are your periods?’. [end]
[start] People with that extreme of a mentality need to be eradicated [end]
[start] Grew up in same circumstance. Diffrence was my parents shunned cowardice too...so I irreverently told them what i did. They were pissed for a week then went on to give me the best advice for being sexually active. The person you share a bed with may be the person you have to share your life with for 18+ years if you concieve or you may have a reminder of that person for the rest of your life if they give you a venereal disease. This sharpened my outlook for women i chose to be sexually active with kept me from one night stands and created true value when sharing a bed with a woman. Now I am married with two beautiful daughters and a beautiful wife. I played the feild a bit, but played it strategically. I listened to my parents advice, but didnt let it become a dictation for my life. I was honest and fearless. Be that, it will piss your parents off, but in the long run the pain of them knowing will be lessened comparitivly to you getting pregnant and having to tell them. And if they want you to wait they are also probably pro-life, as am I. So if you were to then decide to abort you would destrpy your relationship with your family far more substantially. [end]
[start] I appreciate your position I truly do, it is a valid point. When medical personnel use the term “doing my job” it is unsettling. Just because at this point in time it makes sense doesn’t mean a few years down the road when different social/political norms change. there might be some things you are truly against but society will tell you it’s alright and interfere with your family. That is my only point. History shows is that this is a very slippery slope and we should look at all sides. Again your point is valid. There are some horrible examples out there. [end]
[start] Did you have two broken arms by chance? [end]
[start] Not too long after I became sexually active, and after taking the morning after pill a few times already, mum came along with me to the doctor despite me wanting to go alone. I sat away from her and filled the form that they give you up, turned it to the other side and quickly and messily explained my situation and how I needed it to be kept a secret due to her "religious" views (really just pride and another reason to easily start more passive aggressive ignoring, arguing etc.) and that I'd be complaining about bad cramps (not a lie) and was hoping to be prescribed the pill. I asked a nurse to pass the paper directly to the doctor before my mother and I were called in, she seemed confused but quickly agreed. The doctor then proceeded to go through with it as planned and even insisted on it and how it would help my irregular cycles (also true) then asked for a few minutes with me alone, supposedly routinely, to explain the rest to me. I was 20 and just not at all on good terms with her, yes there are many questions to be asked but the point is that everybody was so caring and helpful, even reassuring and extremely understanding. A nurse turned her frown upside down, gave me a huge smile and let me know they'd be there for me for absolutely anything. [end]
[start] I can’t wait to be a nurse! Great story. [end]
[start] I was the 1,000th upvote! [end]
[start] Religion is disgusting. I'm glad those nurses knew well enough to protect you. [end]
[start] This post makes me so angry [end]
[start] The fact that you are sexually active or not has nothing to do with getting ovarian cysts. Some woman get them More than others. If I were you I would be checked to make sure you don’t have something more serious like Endometreosis. [end]
[start] Your mom failed big time. Even if I had a chance to have sex I wouldn't have done it. My parents instilled the right amount of guilt and shame into me [end]
[start] So they helped you to deceive your mother? That is great! When you are a parent I hope people help to deceive you too. It will make you happy to know strangers helped your child keep such an important aspect of your child’s  life from you. Kudos [end]
[start] Inappropriate of them. Not their child. [end]
[start] But why didn't you have sex safely ? Don't put yourself in danger because sex should be very safe and clean. Be careful. [end]
[start] Do you love your mom? [end]
[start] You should have just not had sex in high school. If you got caught that would be your fault. That’s too young. It seems as if you are pushing the blame onto your mother when I you were also at fault. [end]
[start] So, the nurses basically did what they had no right to do, since you (a minor at the time) were there for medical care with your parent and legal guardian present. Fairly certain that they acted illegally by hiding relevant information from your mother. Go them... [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[TITLE] So looks like the donald is back to using vote manipulation to flood all with posts. They've only got 20,000 users online but their front page is filled with posts with votes as high as 260,000. For comparision, the second highest post in all of reddit history is only 250,000. [TITLE]
[start] On a similar note, I wish political subs (and all subs) would knock it off with the vote baiting titles. Stuff like "This post about x should be the new #1 post on reddit, lets get it there!" or "We haven't seen a post about x on /r/all in a while let get it to the front page". I feel like the past few weeks there have been so many posts, not just from Trump subs or Anti-Trump subs vote baiting and filling /r/all with useless spammy shit. Isn't this kind of vote baiting with titles against reddiquette anyways? Why aren't the admins doing anything about this and just banning upvote-bait post titles entirely? [end]
[start] nothing on their front page is voted that high. [end]
[start] If I understand OP correctly, he's talking about the fact that posts like this https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5oy9nn/try_defaulting_this_photo_to_0_admins_you_cant/ have 500,000 (20,000 some net upvotes right now with 52% upvoted) plus total votes whereas the Trump winning post had just over 130,000 total votes. If i misunderstood how Reddit records votes let me know, I could be missing something.  [end]
[start] Here's what /r/all would look like if downvotes didn't exist  http://i.imgur.com/5TW9YM3.jpg [end]
[start] Seriously! They think everything is a fucking conspiracy against them. No one would fuck with them if they weren't being immature assholes spamming their shit all over the front page. I like to browse /r/all to discover fun new subs, not to see 50 pictures of Cheeto Benito because they decided to throw a fucking fit. And they're going to completely unrelated subs and spamming it too. The admins need to fucking do something about this shit  EDIT: To everyone saying to filter them, I usually browse on mobile. No filtering on mobile.  [end]
[start] You know people don't have to sub to a subreddit to vote on it right?   [end]
[start] Every time the admins fuck with T_D it just gains them support because people hate administrative censorship.  Just take T_D off of your r/all and do something better with your life than wringing your hands. [end]
[start]  where do you see a single post there with 260k upvotes. Go to /r/pics, the top post there has 60k upvotes but there are only 11k people there. I hate the donald but you just have no idea what you're talking about [end]
[start] You do realize that people can vote on their posts even if they're not subscribed, right?   You're acting like only people who are subbed there would ever upvote any of their posts, which is pretty dumb.   The number of upvotes doesnt indicate brigading - it just indicates that there are far more Trump supporters around reddit than there are The_Donald subscribers.  [end]
[start] This used to bother me until reddit added that subreddit filter option.  Being able to see the frontpage without being smothered with anti-intellectual vote botted posts has been great for my sanity.  At this point it doesn't look like reddit is going to do anything about them, i'd suggest the entire site just filter them out so they can metaphorically be really loud while everyone has them on mute. [end]
[start] It takes 1 min to go there and upvote everything, plus Rising.   then go to other subs.. so the 20,000 online thing is just a fraction of them  [end]
[start] Just an FYI, Reddit does not give you vote totals that is RES calculating it for you using the formula:  Total Points / (2 * .UV -1)  The calculation is an ESTIMATE, and the closer you are to 50% the further off it will be.  Or, if you want to take that route, [How does this post from a subreddit you like get to 330,000 votes](https://np.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/5oyrud/the_official_portrait_of_some_guy_who_sucks/) on a sub with only 66k subs total? [end]
[start] Honestly at this point it doesn't look like reddit is a party day for them. [end]
[start] I forgot they even exist anymore ever since I started to filter them on r/all. [end]
[start] Unsub from T_D and learn how to internet. I've never seen a single post from there and I couldn't care less about what they post.  [end]
[start] Why the hell does any of this matter to anybody at all? It takes less than one second to filter out a subreddit and never see it again. [end]
[start] So are we not gonna talk about ETS and how magically they have the top post?  [end]
[start] I'm not subscribed to their page, yet I gave it an upvote.  The point being membership numbers aren't the determining factor for votes.   [end]
[start] OMG....you ignore trolls if you want them to go away, you don't keep feeding them like this   PS...seems you are full of it, which is far worse.... [end]
[start] Who cares. Seriously just filter them. People whining are being dumb and probably just trying to push their own agenda. Just filter them. It's as simple as that. You don't like their views or posts. FILTER. It's really not as big a deal as Reddit is making it (or /r/the_donald for that matter) [end]
[start] In sorry but I see the exact opposite left propaganda just as much. [end]
[start] op is full of shit.. the most upvoted post there today is like 30k [end]
[start] Censoring T_D will on guarantee Trump an 8 year term. Censoring him is further agitating everyone. You can simply filter out the bullshit like everyone else and stop acting like the world revolves around you. By the way, the admins have done something and it only hurt them very bad. /u/spez openly editing comments and manipulating post points to zero.  [end]
[start] Just block it ffs [end]
[start] 20,000 users online, TD has nothing with more than 25,000 up votes. Stop lying.   [end]
[start] Thw Admins fucked with the algo and exposed it. It posses people off - even non trump fans. [end]
[start] This might come as a surprise but you don't have to be on a sub to see its posts and vote on them.  So the "there's only this many users online (in that sub)" thing is fairly moronic to how the site works. [end]
[start] The enoughtrumpspam sub is much more annoying. [end]
[start] Let me tell you about this neat feature called the filter... [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] and when admins figure out the new exploit the_donald is using to brigade the front page, we're going to see the same whining all over again.   *Nobody else is being punished for this, just us! There was no rule against this specific thing, you can't punish us! Not making all of our shitposts the first thing you see is taking away our rights to free speech! It's not our fault for abusing loopholes, it's your fault for not filtering us!*   I can't wait [end]
[start] Where are these mythical posts you're seeing at 260k? What 250k post are you talking about? What are you smoking? [end]
[start] Just filter it out.  [end]
[start] If you don't like the subreddit why don't you filter it out? There are multiple ways to do that.  [end]
[start] Talk about admins altering people's posts, removing posts or altering vote counts... yeeeeaaaah [end]
[start] Yes and what the admins need to do is make r/politics  a place where political discussion can happen.  What you are currently seeing is what you might call "blowback". [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] /r/SandersForPresident has the number one post with 46,000 upvotes and only 2,300 comments. Why aren't you crying about that?   /r/EnoughTrumpSpam was the top post all day with 49,000 upvotes and only 2,300 comments. Why aren't you crying about that?    [end]
[start] I'm not subscribed to the Donald, but I upvoted every post they made because fuck u/spez and censorship. Learn your lesson Reddit admins.  [end]
[start] They use vote botting and manipulation to make the "tri post images" you see with an image being split up into 3 pieces and then coming together on the front page to make a full image. It's utterly blatant and the admins need to grow a pair and remove T_D from the site and stop this "bastion of free speech" bullshit.  People spewing unsourced, faked bullshit like "teachers at this school are sharing bathrooms with your daughters" is downright dangerous and is being used to sway minds that don't have the time or thought to fact check. [end]
[start] Stop going on /r/all and start doing you. [end]

[start] Who the fuck cares.  It's time to get a life, OP. Maybe even go outside. [end]
[start] OP is either stupid or a liar [end]
[start] They've actually been suppressing themselves from the front page using the sticky rule. Now they've stopped abusing the stickies they are back on all. [Here's a theoryofreddit post on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/5nf78g/the_donald_appears_to_have_been_using_stickies_to/).   The_donald has been censoring it's users from all for the last 2 months. Probably to create a feeling of victimization among its users. [end]

[start] Lurking donald supporters? [end]
[start] Something needs to be done about these Russians and 4chan trolls. [end]
[start] I filtered out that hate sub as soon as it was made possible. Not seen their bullshit since then I had kind of forgotten they existed. [end]
[start] You mean the russian bot and paid spammer complex? [end]
[start] It's pretty clear that /r/T_D has tons of bots running.   There has been the most insane and factually wrong stuff posted that was into several thousand points in no time.   But they drive traffic to reddit and no news outlet has reported on it so it's fine for the admins. [end]
[start] I am subscribed to Trump's Twitter so I can see exactly what he is saying to the American people, that is what I base my opinion of him and his followers on. On reddit I am only subbed to subreddits I want to see, r/self is the only place I see political stuff on a day-to-day basis. r/all is usually filled with stuff from the base subs or shitposts that have no intelligence. That's not why I'm on reddit. Don't go on r/all if you don't want to see shitposts. [end]
[start] False. 300,000+ subs [end]
[start] Just because someone doesn't share your liberal opinion they need to be dealt with? It's pretty funny that trump supporters have been called fascists... [end]
[start] OP, youre retarded [end]
[start] Up votes from non subscribed users on /r/all contribute [end]
[start] who cares? filter them and all the other shitposting politic subs... make reddit great again [end]
[start] Only vote manipulation are the bots used to downvote anything from T_D because people are snowflakes. [end]

[start] You do realize that once something hits /r/all...That anyone can vote on it?  /r/tattoos has 300 online, yet their one post on /r/all has over 8500 total upvotes. That's 28:1 vote to online ratio. Compared to 10:1 for TD.  OMG VOTE MANIPULATION!!!!  Stop contributing to the spam you stupid fuck. [end]
[start] You don't have to be on their sub Reddit to upvote a post from it, I thought everybody knew that [end]
[start] vote manipulation... the irony of this statement coupled with the new filter placed coincidentally when trump became popular on this site only proves how retardedly delusional you people are. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] People other than T_D subscribers upvote T_D posts purely out of spite for the special snowflake admins that are constantly manipulating the site to try to control people. [end]

[start] Why would you expect anything different from them? Trump is cheat and liar, it seems his fans are too? [end]
[start] You should make a post about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/REEEEEE/  Filter them out if you dont like it. but its a protest for admin's fucking with them.  Maybe they did or didn't I don't know.   What other sites are they brigading?  I visit many subs, even politics, but I must admit as t_d was busy with the repost, my first reaction was to come here and see the complaints.  [end]

[start] As someone with depression it annoys me when you people care after the fact. When I text you" hey" weeks in a row and you don't respond or when I ask "can I please stop by" and you say you are busy, or when I ask if you want to go to dinner but you can't because you are too busy getting ready for lolla fuck all you guys.... now you care?  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] As someone who works for a line (not NSPL) you can seriously call for whatever reason you want to talk, you do not have to be suicidal. Sometimes people are just lonely or want to talk about their day. And it's 100% confidential. [end]
[start] Since age eleven I have survived because I know no one cares. If I had the same illusions of safety and comfort as many of you, if I were bound to the little things which you take for granted, I'd have been done a very long time ago. I'm not trapped in this trashy spectacle of a realm with you. You, are trapped down here with me.  And another thing, since I've drank myself into balls out Soul Reaver goth mode. Why act like this was a tragedy? The man was 62 years old. He had a good run and ended it on his own terms. I'm rather inspired by his example.  [end]

[start] I know everyone's heart is in the right place, but something always bothers me about the idea of going around posting the suicide hotline #. All the sudden people come out of the woodwork and pretend they give a shit about random people they don't know for a few days. And they pat themselves on the back for doing something important. But is a phone # a cure for suicide? Is a phone call going to fix someone's life? I doubt it. I also think we should respect people's decisions to end their life on their own terms.   It's definitely not a good idea to end your life too soon, but let's face it we're all slowly dying, it's just a matter of when. Who are we to second guess someone's decision to chose the date that's going to happen? If you want to help people, help a friend or family member in a real way that matters. Going on some crusade online isn't going to do anything.  [end]
[start] They don't care that I have to live with disabilities that make my life hell. They don't care that I'll never be able to experience the things that make their own lives worth living. They don't care that I have to bear agony day after day for the rest of my life. They only care that I keep being alive and they don't give a FUCK what kind of a life it is. They are fucking happy that the only ways I could kill myself are horribly risky and horrifying. Yes, no one cares about this.  [end]
[start] Whenever I see people post shit like this it always comes off as so fucking inauthentic. Do you think suicidal people don't realize that suicide prevention hotlines exist? Damn, if only Robin Williams knew of suicide prevention hotlines he'd still be alive!! [end]
[start] After this very recent tragedy this is more important than ever. Depression is a real disease and there can be help out there. Please reach out to as many people as possible if you are feeling suicidal. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I don't think all people commit suicide because they think no one cares. They do it because *they* don't care anymore. Part of being depressed is the erosion of caring. You lose interest in things you used to like, things you used to only tolerate become irritating, things you found irritating become intolerable. Over time most things move down the list from one of those categories to the other until you start to wonder what the point of even being alive is anymore. That's when suicide starts to look like a pretty good option. [end]
[start] It's difficult to understand, feel, and accept this kind of empathy when you're depressed.  I'm glad there's people still trying, but I do wonder how many people are helped by this stuff. [end]
[start] If i committed suicide, I don't think more than 2000 people would even know about it. The am quite impressed that another 1,998,000 people would care about something they didn't know happened.  [end]
[start] Does that cost money to call? [end]

[start] As a person suffering from loneliness and depression this can never be posted enough.  What gets to me most is I don't approve of what he did but I understand it.  Also he used my preferred method and I understand that too. Took me 6 years before I could keep rope in my house. [end]
[start] Actually, you are lucky if 1 or 2 people really care. [end]
[start] Feeling like nobody cares isn't always the reason for depression. It's merely a symptom for a lot of us. [end]
[start] People say suicide is selfish, but I feel that telling someone they need to live when they clearly don't want to, just because a group of strangers (theoretically) cares, is a bit selfish too. [end]
[start] Millions care, as long as a famous person dies and the news tells you to care.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Honestly: As someone who has had mental health problems in the past, Thank You Internet.  The internet is always there. Someone always cares what you are talking about. You can always find someone who has it worse or understands what you are going through. Even if you have no friends or a family that will not listen, the internet is always there for you. To make you laugh. To listen and give advice. A place where people will make fun of you, but really do care about complete strangers. People are always there, even on Reddit. [end]
[start] No they don't. Quit pandering and just be real...the people *close to you* will care and everyone else will be totally unaware.  Another stroke of truth is that suicide might just be someone's ultimate wish, but it is horribly irresponsible to create a mess that someone else has to clean up. [end]
[start] Every. Single. Day.  It goes through my mind at least a few times.   I've struggled with suicide for almost 2 years now.     Knowing help is out there has made a difference for me.   It's a tough fight not to give in to the gravity of suicide, but the brightest stars in my sky keep me going.  The people I love, and who love me.  Those are the stars in my sky, but it can be a terrible struggle sometimes. [end]
[start] Nope don't think so.  [end]
[start] I think this would be a good place to share my story. I was suicidal for 3 years. I attempted suicide twice, and both times was committed to a mental hospital. Earlier this year, I felt that I would never feel better. I spent a few weeks planning out my suicide letter, but was too scared to write it down. Then I got drunk with a friend one night and drove home. I passed out with my foot on the gas and swerved off the road, colliding with a tree at 90 mph. I really should have died that night, but I'm so glad I didn't. I got cards, messages, and flowers from people I hadn't talked to in years. I thought there was no one that cared about me, but it ended up that there were lots of people that cared. Sometimes people don't show that they care when they really do. I promise there's people that love you and would miss you if you were gone.  [end]
[start] **I know this may not get seen, and that it may not feel like much coming from an internet stranger - but if you *ever* need to talk, please don't hesitate to message me. I don't want anyone feeling like they're alone in this world. I know that feeling. And it fucking sucks.**  EDIT: Also, I don't know if this has been posted yet, but here are some UK numbers:  **Samaritans**: 08457 90 90 90 - 24 hours a day  **Childline**: 0800 1111 - for children & young people  **PAPYRUS**: 0800 068 41 41 - for teenagers & young adults with suicidal thoughts  Also, the **[Depression Alliance](http://www.depressionalliance.org/)**, **[Students Against Depression](http://studentsagainstdepression.org/)** and **[Bullying UK](http://www.bullying.co.uk/)** have resources for those in need. Specifically for young men, there's also the **[Campaign Against Living Miserably](https://www.thecalmzone.net/)**. They also have a hotline - 0800 58 58 58. [end]
[start] I'm in school to be a mental health counselor. I was having doubts about if I would really be making a difference and this just reaffirmed that I could and would be able to.  [end]
[start] I don't think there's a cure for everyone. Sometimes it seems that people who have suicidal tendencies, choose to seek treatment for their families benefit, more so than their own.   Suicide doesn't ease the pain, it transfers the pain to people who care about you. That's a lot of pressure for someone who is already doubting their ability to live a fulfilling life.   Just my thoughts on the matter. [end]
[start] I don't know why people post this. If you think depressed people don't want to talk to family members about their depression do you think they want to talk to strangers over the phone?   This post won't do shit.  [end]

[start] I have depression. To date, the only thing that's made me feel better in the long term are the pills they give me.  Drink and girls help, but that's like using band aids for gunshot wounds...   ^I ^need ^a ^wife [end]
[start] I'd like to mention 7 cups of tea here.  It's a place to chat about mental illness with people who are there to listen.  In my experience I've been chased off the phone after speaking on the suicide hotline for more than 20 or 30 minutes.  It's made me not want to use it anymore.  I used 7 cups of tea and have chatted with a few very kind and understanding people, some of whom even followed up the next day or days later to see how I was.  Some of the listeners are asking for money, but it's easy to sort by whether or not you'd want to pay the person.  I choose not to, simply because I feel I'd get more of a genuine response from the people who do it for free. [end]
[start] there is no help for suicide in this country other than the internet. friends, family, and others close to you would rather not be placed in the awkward and stressful situation of listening to you talk about it. by mentioning suicide to your therapist, they are required by law to involuntarily commit you to a hospital. i can't imagine what this hotline would do other than attempt to involuntarily commit you as well. this generally creates more problems than it solves. [end]
[start] ... billions ... reach out ... just baby steps [end]
[start] I find the idea that someone outside my family could actually care about me.  I'm not saying it's not possible, just that I'm not used to it. [end]
[start] A friend of mine made an app called [CheckUp](http://www.checkupapp.org/#/) to help prevent suicide. It analyzes your Twitter feed and looks for people tweeting things that may be indicative of suicidal thoughts. If it finds something, it'll send you an email letting you know to reach out to that person. [end]
[start] Honestly these famous and rich people killing themselves is not doing a good job of advertising the fact that people care. Because if they feel alone and helpless, imagine how a homeless or jobless person feels. [end]
[start] Are psychiatrists that difficult to come by? Or do they just not help?  I see a few people here talking about not being able to find help, and I understand that. But shouldn't they be looking for a psych specialist or a counselor? I'm genuinely interested. [end]

[start] I don't want a million strangers to care about me. I want someone that matters to care about me, and to matter to someone. Otherwise, there's no point, there's only alone. [end]
[start] Thanks. As someone going through a pretty horrible bout with recurring severe clinical depression, this is really nice to see. It's an incredibly isolating thing sometimes, and frustrating for those around you. Good to know there's a voice to talk to somewhere. [end]
[start] Those are some of the most rudest fucks I ve ever talked to.  [end]
[start] Ok so. I'm not going to kill myself or hurt myself but I spend a solid amount of my time fairly depressed. When I'm depressed sometimes I can hear voices. I know they're not there so I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing that I can recognize it. I can hear them talking just around the corner from me and if I walk around the corner they move again. I hear a man and a woman talking, the woman has a really high pitched voice and I can't make out what they're saying, but sometimes I can hear strays words or hear them say my name. Sometimes I hear a guy who speaks like a sports announcer. Also sometimes when I look in mirrors I have difficulty recognizing my face.  Is that normal, is it ok if I'm otherwise not self destructive, or do I need to go to a doctor before something really bad happens? [end]
[start] Question..is talking to them without having thoughts of suicide still okay? [end]
[start] It's not about whether people care about you or not.  It's about the misery of living.  Proper medication can address the chemical imbalances.  Therapy/support groups can help change the attitudes and actions of the afflicted.  The problem is that depression causes metaphorical paralysis, whereby the person doesn't want to do anything at all, including making a phone call where the person on the other line will want them to do something. [end]
[start] The gesture is kind but I think you're selling hotline as something they're not. Millions care, really?   It sounds patronizing to anyone who's been depressed or been put under enough stress that they've considered suicide.  Depressed? Need family or friends to talk to? Here's platitudes from strangers!  LIFE IS A DISNEY MOVIE PEOPLE [end]
[start] I believe people have the right to live if they want or die if they want.  I mean doctors are prescribing anti-depressants and I've seen what those pills can do to someone I've met  this perfectly functioning then she was prescribed and she was not the same at all the antidepressants fucked up her brain.  I think doctors are taking the wrong approach.  I believe if someone really wants to get out of their depression they should take a large dose of Mushrooms this will help them face their depression and fight through it when they come out of the trip they'll have a whole new perception and a lot of respect for their life.  Taking anti-depressants for depression is like putting a band aid over a flesh wound.  And if even after one wants to commit suicide who are we to deny them of their right to. Some people simply just don't want to live and I can accept that.  [end]
[start] Better than a shit tinted lens right? Can't be naive of reality but u need a positive attitude to keep striving forward. [end]
[start] I do.. If you have problems, I'll listen and chat. Life is beautiful. There was a time where you weren't depressed or suicide, we can try to help you find that place once again.  [end]

Go into debt if you have to. [end]
[start] Congratulations everyone you managed to villify the suicide prevention hotline, we did it reddit! [end]
[start] The sad part is i bet Robbin afterwards wishes he could undo today. Just think of someone you love and if they were to do that how it would affect you. My mind right now is thinking, your gonna die anyways may as well stick it out. I know thats not good advice for a person with sever depression but, to those who are going through tough times i hope you do realize that the pain is all just a trick and you can be helped! Don't give in to the trick, seek help! Im praying for you! [end]

Of they say no then it should be pointed out to them remorselessly.   Malicious stupidity should not be excused, this is like drunk driving, it was a choice they made, it endangered others and themselves and they need to understand that society as a whole outside of their little bubble views it as such. [end]
[start] The frustration for me is if they live they'll tell everyone "coronavirus is no big thing" while exhaling. [end]
[start] I struggle with this too.  I want to be a good person, but fuck you idiots. [end]
[start] I've taught my kids from elementary that I teach you basic skills to stay alive. You make stupid decisions after that, its your funeral.    They are now 17 and 14 and use the statement regularly.  My empathy has ran out for Covid deniers. Its their funeral.  If my kids understood that at 7, Karen's and Brocks should be able to as well. [end]
[start] Do they acknowledge anything about their mistake or the existence of Covid now? Or do they choose to say nothing? Just curious. [end]
[start] Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of my own actions... [end]
[start] I don’t feel bad for them at all. [end]
[start] How is this actually a thing? What the fuck happened to America? [end]
[start] These should be [Darwin Award](https://darwinawards.com/) "honorable mentions".  My MIL is one of them. My wife keeps her from being completely stupid about it.  Edit: Added link to Darwin Awards page [end]
[start] I honestly have no pity for people who don’t think this virus is real at this point. Especially with the people going to the covid parties, like what? [end]
[start] I wouldn’t either, good for you. Also on a unrelated note you just reminded me why I am not going to go to my neighbors surprise 50th bday party. They have a same views as your aunt and her husband and I’m DEFINITELY not trying to get sick because they think it’s a hoax... fake news, Trump is king, “All lives matter”, people who wear masks are sheep. Yada , yada, yada! I can’t believe I was even considering it, wtf is wrong with me? Thanks OP! [end]
[start] See and this is the crap that upsets me so much. My mom is a nurse and her entire floor is covid cases. They were hanging in there and getting by with the little they had. Now  after last week, it’s worse than ever. My mom says they are so many patients the floors are crowded not enough equipment. Nurses are quitting, the little nurses left are worked.  She called me a couple of hours ago and said she herself felt sick, she needs a test, they aren’t providing any for healthcare workers and on their time off they have to find a testing site. It’s so crappy. She says she has a sore throat and is not feeling well.  The thing about these shit heads with this kind of thinking is healthcare workers have families and children. I don’t want my mom getting sick due to some dumb ass not wanting to put on a damn face covering and social distance. It’s mind blowing. Honestly I don’t feel bad for your family and yes they are taking up space for sure.  And you know what that self pitying they are doing, they can go fuck themselves. [end]
[start] People who deny the reality of Coronavirus should be denied hospital care. Ugh. [end]
[start] Although pandemic is the worst thing to happen, it reveals incompetent imbeciles in US politics, use this opportunity to find them and vote them out so that you people of America have a better chance of survive. [end]
[start] The best line... Yes, we are from Florida. [end]
[start] Part of me doesn’t like anyone getting sick.  But stories like this give me pleasure and faith in natural selection.  Science prevails. [end]
[start] At this point the best thing to do is triple down and ask them how much they’re being paid to be actors. It will really open a new world of how shitty this road is. [end]
[start] I understand you. I live in front of a park. Today like 20 (no joke) cars arrived with kids and they made a happy-bday caravan party, kids in the park playing, moms and dads talking wih each other, of course no mask, kids throwing garbage of presents, poping ballons. It just triggered me, called the cops and of course they didn't arrive. People just know how to brake barriers in stupidity. [end]
[start] They  need to put more people like this on TV. Ask them if they have any regrets.   Statistics don't work for most people. [end]
[start] Ai based Taylor made new feeds makes things much more worse, once people get stuck in the loop of conspiracy theories and anti mask fake corona stuffs, the news just keep coming, that’s a big failure of Ai. I am not saying it’s bad but it’s def not capable to be deployed in large scale. [end]
[start] This Coronavirus may as well be a leopard with the amount of face it's eating... [end]
[start] I have noticed in my community that some of the most successful people (like your car dealer/Realtor combo) are virus deniers. I think this pandemic is bringing out what we value most. For me, it’s my family. I haven’t been within 12 feet of any one of them since March. We talk much more on video than we did before. We recently cancelled a beach trip together because there is just no way to be safe even if we quarantined before hand.  I think a lot of those in denial value their businesses more than their neighbors lives, which is pretty short sighted. [end]
[start] Literally just moved out of Florida as cases have started spiking again. Stay healthy! [end]
[start] i wonder how many folks have backed out of moving to FL, from retirement to jobs etc. because of all this shitstorm... [end]
[start] "yes, we are from Florida" is the piss-flavored icing on this shit sandwich. [end]
[start] How sick have they gotten? Not that j want them to die over it, but I think I want them to suffer al little. Just for the lesson Ofcourse, lol [end]
[start] Stupidly is contagious [end]
[start] May you and your family be free from suffering and the causes of suffering. May you be healthy. May you be happy. May you live peacefully and joyfully in this world. [end]
[start] I still think everybody who refuses a mask should sign something that says "We know and don't care about the risks. If we get it don't treat us."    That way, resources can go to people who deserve to be treated, instead of people who look for the virus and demand treatment when they find it.  But that doesn't seem likely. [end]
[start] I'm honestly curious if this kind of mentality is a means of defense. The kind of denial a child uses when they cover their heads with a blanket to hide from the shadows in their room kinda deal. No one wants to hear about the world crumbling and the inevitability of death, so some people just deny it all together. Idk, just kinda spitballing here, but I think their might be some truth to my thoughts. [end]
[start] I'm in a sort of similar situation, wife's aunt is a Trumper who contracted Covid (not through any irresponsible behavior, it was through her healthcare job).  She almost died, but was an early case and is months into recovery now.    She and her family make weird comments about my MIL wearing a mask when they see her with one.  This woman was in an induced coma for nearly two weeks in the ICU with hospital staff telling her family to prepare for the worst, and to this day has negative side effects from her illness, maybe permanent.  To say nothing of what the extended hospital stay cost.  Total nightmare.  I think because she and most of her immediate family came down with covid and survived, she thinks she has permanent immunity so she's comfortable going right back to asshole Trump supporter behavior. [end]
[start] Pure arrogance. I wonder how many people they’ll end up killing. [end]
[start] This is one of those moments where I start to question whether "blood is thicker than water", or whatever that shitty platitude is. I am almost at the point where I am going to disassociate with family members like this. [end]
[start] Were they my relatives I’d be all but laughing at them with their request for sympathy. I can only imagine what they had to say about George Floyd - not much in the way of sympathy I’m sure [end]
[start] The world suffered from red dumb ass religious states deciding the fate of the western world by voting for a moron.   Many of those uneducated voters will now die by that decision  Good riddance grandpa and gram gram in rural red voting areas. [end]
[start] They sound like shitty people. [end]
[start] If they haven't changed their minds about everything, including Trump. I  don't think I could deal with them. [end]
[start] Keep loving them. Rise above their behaviour. Hopefully this has been an educational experience for them, they survive, and they become a voice of reason in their community.   I pity anyone with coronavirus, although the depth does vary. [end]
[start] And the worst part is if they survive this they will be gullible enough to fall for the next bullshit from the Republican party. They never learn. [end]
[start] They should do a spot on the local news in their area and say how wrong they were. They should at the very least put it in their Facebook page [end]
[start] You have every right to think this way. Some people really do not learn until it is too late. Maybe this will “help” them realize that this is not a hoax after all. Dumbasses. (Sorry!) [end]
[start] I think some humans literally can’t adapt I know it sounds crazy But hear me out we have lived normal life’s for so long that people can except it because They don’t know how especially old people like imagine you’re 70 years old and you have been living the same normal life but then you automatically have to switch because coronavirus people won’t except they will say the dumbest shit because they are too afraid and they don’t want there life to change because they themselves are selfish because they think It will toy with there happiness   I wish we could all work together notice that social distant is key to survival but even if we did fix this problem the world will throw another one to always keep us on our feet   But anyways stay safe and level headed  Also my mom is an urgent care nurse And wears a mask and has never gotten sick  Four times a week she comes into urgent care she has came in contact more times than I can count but Is not infective masks do help [end]
[start] People are selfish. Selfish selfish selfish. And the world is paying for it. [end]
[start] I have an ex friend who’s going to trump rally’s and anti mask protests and I wouldn’t be surprised if she expects pity when she gets COVID too [end]
[start] Send them daily texts of things they used to say lmao [end]
[start] Waiting for the day/ excuses/ pure, unadulterated BULLSHIT when tRump gets the virus.   Call it karma, call it whatever you like. People who DENY REALITY and make others miserable deserve whatever they get until and only if they begin to accept reality as it is, not just on their terms.   Karma, short and simple. Karma.  P.S. I’m from New Zealand where we’re actually managing the pandemic with a leader who tells it like it is, adult-adult. And we’re winning!   We look aghast at American ignorance with shock, horror and extreme sympathy, and wonder how you tolerate that sociopath who calls himself your ‘leader’ walking you all slowly but inexorably over the cliff-face..  P.P.S. there IS a solution [end]
[start] Ask them to just "Pray the Hoax Away". [end]
[start] > and yes, we are from Florida    Y’all are a rare fucking breed down there. Is it something in the water that makes ya have meth brain or does everyone seriously just do meth? [end]
[start] Of course this is Florida XD [end]
[start] Have a close friend just like this. I am ashamed.... [end]
[start] They are doing Dexter's work for him.  Yes. Everything I know about Florida I learned from Dexter. And Scarface. [end]
[start] TLDR: he’s from Florida [end]
[start] So, a couple of old Gator Fuckers voted for the Leopards Eating Faces party and got their faces eaten because they listened to the leopard when he said it was just a scratch, a nibble, like having a kitten bite your finger.  Welp! Who saw that coming, besides everyone? Literally everyone? [end]
[start] I’ll bet money they won’t learn [end]
[start] I don’t know how to Unbreak people like this... it’s infuriating. [end]
[start] I don't wish death on anyone, but there are some obituaries that will bring a smile to my face. [end]
[start] I hear this shit at work from customers. I wear a mask at work for 8 hours a day. Working as a cashier has me wondering if I should quit for my health. Their half-hour trip they can't stand to wear a mask for could kill someone.  One of my coworkers might have tested positive and I don't think my job would tell me if they did - if they knew. [end]
[start] Here is my award 🥇 [end]
[start] > And now they are in the hospital taking up bed space. I almost feel like they don’t deserve it. They cut off their noses to spite their faces. They said this virus was a HOAX. They MADE FUN of people wearing masks. Now they expect to be waited on hand and foot by the hospital staff and have made no apology, no back-track, just wallowing in their own self-pity and saying “we didn’t know it would happen to us, we didn’t think it was that bad, we didn’t believe...”  These kind of people, while they can't be refused medical care, should be made to be the lowest priority for care. [end]
[start] I say if they were openly anti mask and openly believed it was a democratic hoax that they be put last in line for an ICU bed and someone else who took the proper precautions that got infected by people like this got priority..  they don't deserve the care if they didn't believe it's a threat. [end]
[start] I talked (online) with someone who said: "I'm not going to wear a mask! I have respiratory issues and it's hard for me to breathe!" [end]
[start] Its unfortunate that these people hurt more than just themselves. Even if they were asymptomatic they could kill some one with their carelessness. Some cases show that there are long term effects to the body, even for people who weren't so sick they needed a ventilator.   These people are an embarrassment to our country. I could only imagine how they would handle something like the war time rationing of WWII. Trump supporters are racist, selfish, and weak willed bafoons. They have a "patriotic" facade, but lack the values our democracy should stand for. Sickening really. November is coming. Be ready to vote. [end]
[start] I get why some people argue the mask thing. We were first told they’re pointless then told we must wear them. So I get if you’re indifferent but to put it simple. We all don’t agree on things. so choosing your own actions and beliefs is one thing. Yet feeling like you don’t need to wear a mask is a choice that can effect thousands. So stay da fuq home if you don’t wanna wear a mask. We live in a day and age where you can literally get anything delivered. [end]
[start] I hope everyone of these virus deniers catch COVID and die. I don’t care if that sounds mean. [end]
[start] I say let mother nature weed out the idiots 🤘 [end]
[start] The last sentence made me lol...I’m from Florida too 😔. [end]
[start] Please send them my thoughts and prayers.   /s [end]
[start] try to get in on the will now!  they are on the clock [end]
[start] You should remind them that this is all going to take longer because of them.  The longer people play pretend about the pandemic, the longer it's all going to take, and they should wear a mask and shut the fuck up. [end]
[start] Theres covid deniers, mask refusers, Q anon believers fucking everywhere these days. Have y'all seen twitter? It's a cesspool of stupidity. Hopefully this disease will cull some of the fucking idiots from the herd... [end]
[start] Obligatory sorry for your family and all, but fuck these people. They DON’T deserve to use hospital resources. What the FUCK did they expect? Why would THEY be the exception to this global pandemic. Your aunt and uncle are among the selfish assholes making life miserable for those of us who give a damn about the rest of society. I’m so disgusted by people acting like this pandemic isn’t a big deal and doesn’t apply to them while the bodies pile up. What is it going to take for them to realize?? Apparently not even these idiots contracting the virus either. [end]
[start] They brought it on themselves. Aren't we supposed to take personal responsibility for our actions? [end]
[start] As someone sick (test results are not back yet), it makes me mad. I have worn a mask and only gone out infrequently as necessary, but I probably got infected by people like this! It’s not fair for me or my family that the willful ignorance of others risks our lives and health! [end]
[start] what you're describing is exactly what's likely to happen to my aunt.  Every detail of your story lines up with her situation, except the husband is in a different good-ol'-boy industry.  She blocked me on Facebook for talking back to her when she posted a long screed about staying open for the economy.  what burns me up is that this didn't have to be the case.  It didn't have to be political or partisan.  Even Nixon would have advised people to wear masks, would have listened to Fauci, would have stayed in the WHO, would not have named random drugs to try out...  but the way Trump and his cabinet are behaving, it's as if they're trying to spread the virus as fast as possible.  do they think I'm trying to get people to stay home because I hate fun or something?  i don't want an i-told-you-so trophy, because that's ta toe tag.  and i don't want anyone, including myself, to use this virus as a lazy eugenics program... [end]
[start] I want them to preach to all their friends about how bad it is with the same strength as they did denouncing it before they got sick. I want them to convert the ignorant and self-involved. Fuck pity. [end]
[start] It's really really hard to not see things like this and say "Yup, fuck 'em, fuck 'em all." but for all the innocents they also kill with their selfish actions.  Really really really trying not to feel good about it. [end]
[start] If there is one thing you should really hammer in their heads, is that they are probably guilty of infecting and possibly killing other innocent folks. Fuck pity, they should feel guilty about harming others. [end]
[start] It's always been obvious what idiots these people are, but this mask thing is just the fucking icing. [end]
[start] Of course they didn’t give a crap until it affected them. Typical conservative worldview. [end]
[start] You should publicly shame them on social media. Let them and everyone in there circles know that what they did is not ok. [end]
[start] I feel sorry for them, because this is the decision they were educated to make. Our stupidity is partially our responsibility, but also of those who raised us, who live with us, and who spend time with us. [end]
[start] um yes they absolutely deserve it and they’re absolutely horrible people for now demanding the attention and help of health care workers who they have been explicitly REJECTING for months. people like this should be on a fucking banned list from every hospital. if you decide to ignore basic safety precautions because you are so fucking immensely selfish, and you deny science and medical professionals every step of the way, you should be completely fucking banned from then having the audacity to asking for the HELP of those same people. they have absolutely no business taking up resources in the hospital, they deserve to be home alone with no one but themselves since the only person in the world they are willling to listen to or give a fuck about is themselves. I would tell them exactly that and then tell them to stay the fuck out of my life until they get serious professional mental and emotional help.   people who inherently support lunatics like this by keeping them in their lives are almost as bad as the lunatics themselves. if they’re going to be hateful, disgusting, fact-denying people then they should not have the privilege of keeping reasonable and ethical loved ones in their lives. anyone with morals would not be able to align themselves with someone so truly antisocial and unethical. these people have malignant antisocial personalities and are intent on ripping apart society at the threads. anyone who supports them or enables them while they behave in such a way is incredibly irresponsible. the only way to deal with someone like this in your life, after you’ve tried and failed to get them to see reason, is to tell them that you’re absolutely sickened by their lack of morals and to leave you alone until they’re ready to get serious treatment and address their emotional and personality issues that lead to them being like this. [end]
[start] >They cut off their noses to spite their faces.  Wait, your relatives cut off their own noses? Why? and how? O.o  Edit: To whomever downvoted this: This is a serious question, not trolling. I don't understand what OP's sentence means. [end]
[start] Fucking hell, this is never gonna end here, is it? Because they're followers, because the people they follow cater to fear and misinformation, and because DeSantis kisses Trump's ass. [end]
[start] Someone's probably going to die due to their pride and apathy.  138,000 deaths they were mocking and 328.2 million of their fellow citizens they couldn't care less about.  This virus is really showing us how stupid and selfish many Americans are. [end]
[start] I’m assuming their older? Like idk 45+ (all though not everyone at that age is as selfish) but idk dude if they didn’t want to believe it until it happened to them, it’s on them. No reason to feel bad but that’s just my opinion. [end]
[start] I agree they’re taking up space in the hospital. And on earth in general. Instead of being educated and informed (which usually doesn’t entail me wanting someone rid of) they’re putting other people’s lives at risk because they choose to invest themselves in selfish, privileged, conservative views. And now they’re suffering the brunt of their ignorance. Good. And good riddance maybe. [end]
[start] Sigh [end]
[start] [Insert Joker meme] [end]
[start] America [end]
[start] Send them this... could save their life.   https://youtu.be/eDSDdwN2Xcg [end]
[start] I wish I could send this to them. Why don't you tell them yourself or are you too much of a coward [end]
[start] Our Prime Minister (Boris Johnson - Britain) went around a hospital shaking hands with patients, not wearing gloves or a mask... bragged about it afterwards. Guess who got coronavirus? He ended up in hospital.   And my friends who are doctors and hospital workers are getting exposed every day because people are partying like nothing's happened. You hear of people still being stupid/drunk/reckless and ending up in hospital for non-corona things. Yet I haven't seen my terminally ill mum for just over 4 months because we're so scared of giving her the virus! [end]
[start] Does medical insurance cover you of you go against medical advice and don't wear a mask? [end]
[start] There shouldn’t be mercy for people like them. If you wanna destroy your health, that’s on you but why should someone else suffer because of your dumbass? [end]
[start] Good for them... [end]
[start] Haha I’m glad you didn’t come out with that side of the gene pool [end]
[start] Get that power of attorney in case they don't make it. [end]
[start] Yeah, no pity or sympathy for them. Fuck them, they got what they deserved. [end]
[start] This almost sounds like it belongs in r/leopardsatemyface [end]
[start] They will recover. 99.6% survival rate. [end]
[start] Yeah, our ICUs are full here in FL; people who have legitimate emergencies they didn't cause with their own obstinance are being triaged. They're basically negligently killing people. [end]
[start] its so ironic it feels like an story from the old testament. they refused to listen or swallow their pride and wear a mask/social distance and now they are facing gods wrath. [end]
[start] Please send your relatives a message from me....   It’s, ha, haha, hahahaha, ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha  Basically just let them know my mask wearing COVID negative ass is laughing at them [end]
[start] 😀👍 this is so funny 😂 [end]
[start] You know.... if this awesome story is documented - say, on social media, emails, or text messages - you could maybe screenshot it and blur out any identifying info.   And then maybe you could upload said screenshots to /r/leapardsatemyface for all of us to enjoy the delicious schadenfreude.    I, for one, am a huge fan of comeuppance.  :) [end]
[start] Please be sure to relentlessly mock them and bring up the fact that it is 1000% their fault at every chance you get.   These ignorant fucks deserve no sympathy or mercy when it comes to being told the truth - now that does not mean you wish harm on them or further consequences, but I think a little embarrassment is the least they deserve. [end]
[start] Fucks like them deserve to be in Covid camps for the criminally stupid. Clear the cages on the Southern border & lock people like this up. [end]
[start] >we didn’t believe  🖕 is my answer to that. Tough shite. Just like the dude that died after the "covid party". Play stupid games, win stupid prices. [end]
[start] nice [end]
[start] [fuck em.](https://youtu.be/cE0wfjsybIQ?t=26) [end]
[start] Its very selfish, but if you feel like that when it comes to corona id say you should feel the same about smokers, Even though they dont directly Hurt other people most of the time. [end]
[start] They deserve it lol [end]
[start] I dont get anything from trump supporter but kek [end]
[start] Yet agsin, is there a way to deny people like this covid medical services? If it's fake why are they taking up medical services? [end]
[start] Hope the virus wins. [end]
[start] How do they want pity? [end]
[start] You should blow up her social media with things like "is the virus a hoax now?" "Perhaps Fauci was right?" [end]
[start] can we get the #winstupidprizes hashtag trending on facebook? [end]
[start] I wouldn’t pity anyone, relative or otherwise, who fell victim to their own stupidity like that. They can live or die by the consequences of their own stupid actions. [end]
[start] fuckin florida [end]
[start] I hope they don’t have kids because it’d be horrible if they ended up orphaning their own children because of their hubris. [end]
[start] No remorse for the stupid. Ignore the virus, die by the virus. [end]
[start] S [end]
[start] They actually want pity?  Fucking twats [end]
[start] As a healthcare provider I feel pity for people who follow Trump’s every word.  If your aunt is sick enough to be in the hospital it could get worse for her. Tragic. [end]
[start] If one of them were to perish from Covid, then perhaps that's the best lesson for them? [end]
[start] I bet you they won't die [end]
[start] To all the folks hating on them - you are right. BUT you are not showing a whole lot of grace.  Pity them for their ignorance and blindness, their lack of judgement, and the sad predicament that has lead to them being a statistic.  You are not required to be the agent of karma. [end]
[start] Go tell them to check the fuck out of the hospital and get the fuck out of those beds. I’ve got an uncle doing the same ducking thing. [end]
[start] OP will never acknowledge him as their uncle the mad lad. [end]
[start] They deserve it. I'm happpy [end]
[start] I love how you put supporting trump next to denying the virus, what a sneaky little generalization. [end]
[start] Good [end]
[start] They deserve it. [end]
[start] Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes [end]
[start] Owned [end]
[start] I would just keep dealing with them as if they were joking at every attempt of taking pity for acting intentionally this dumb. "Oh, so did you catch coronavirus? Lol, so funny" and they would make another attempt of saying that is serious, repeat infinitely. Coronavirus is serious, but they are a joke, being made fun of is less than what they deserve, they deserve consequences for everyone they exposed while spewing ignorance [end]
[start] Start denying it yourself just to fuck with them. [end]
[start] r/leopardsatemyface [end]
[start] Sorry, you're not getting praise from me, you suck. [end]
[start] thoughts and prayers. [end]
[start] Florida, 'nuf said. [end]
[start] I’m in a similar boat. Aunt and uncle are trumpers and he refuses to isolate or wear a mask. She was trying to get him to wear a mask and stop having his MLM sales pitches in peoples living rooms while the pandemic is going on. He refused and now she has COVID and is not doing well. I surely hope he learns a lesson from this, and that she survives. [end]
[start] Darwin should be proud of them. [end]
[start] Honestly I would just call them and be like   "you know aunt Karen, I understand what you said before... The coronavirus must be fake because the government actually wants to give us microchips. I finally understand you and uncle now. I really suggest you all leave the hospital and stay home because they might want to stick a microchip in your brain, the virus test is a swab in the nose that touches the brain so you may already be tracked. I suggest you quickly escape and stay home until this whole government scheme dies down"  Hopefully your aunt and uncle survive and stop taking up space and it would be best that some medical worker doesn't have to die because of their stupidity. If one does die I sincerely hope whoever gets a medical worker sick especially now also dies. No love for the people killing those who literally are trying to save lives. Good luck OP. [end]
[start] I was just thinking before I finished reading your very last sentence. [end]
[start] Look at a map of virus hotspots. All those states in the deep red? I knew they had a generally stupid population BEFORE the pandemic. I feel vindicated. [end]
[start] If they post about it on social media, ask them what the libs did to get them to join in on the hoax. [end]
[start] People like this are why the lockdown has not worked. [end]
[start] 99% of folks of a certain belief (use your imagination, you’ll easily deduce which ones) don’t care about things until they, themselves, are affected.  i.e.  COVID is a hoax until I contract it.  Or, I won’t wear a mask because I am healthy / invincible, irrespective of how said mask might protect other people.  Selfishness and ignorance are the real pandemics here.  Add COVID and we really, really are in serious trouble.  In other news, I would love to see a graph that correlates IQ with mask usage.  I am no Nostradamus, but I can assure you my speculation would align perfectly with actual data. [end]
[start] r/Maskgret [end]
[start] Just remember the hospital is not letting any visitors in the hospital.  So unless they got a room for themselves, if they someone how die, they die alone with no family around them. [end]
[start] You had me at ‘Trump supporters’. They have lethal flaws and the Darwin effect will do its thing soon enough: *the more stupid you are the faster you’ll die*.  Edit: And I don’t like it that they are using hospital beds and human resources. Fucktards. [end]
[start] I currently have a dear friend in Florida in. the ICU,  he not intubated yet,  just says he's really tired.😢😢😢 [end]
[start] I'm in South Florida. I quarantined immediately in March when shit hit the fan because I had just been to the over crowded beaches and bars before the shutdowns started happening. I didnt think much of the virus back then, not because I didn't think it was real but because I didn't pay attention to the news.  I've kept safe.distances, wear make, sanitize regularly on top of my.normal hygiene and stay isolated fornthe most part. My friends in Nebraska think the virus isn't there at all are dont wear masks and even go on tubing trips together where they are on top of each other. They tell me that I am a high risk to exposingnother just because of where I live. On top of this, theyre antibaxers.   People are fucking stupid and/or inconsiderate of risks. This virus has made me reconsider who I form relationships with. [end]
[start] If I went out and wrecked my car on my own fault, I’m sure people would want to make sure I’m okay...and tell me I’m a dumbass and hope I learned my lesson. I would think that same scenario applies here... [end]
[start] Is sad that people brainwashed into believing lies like that the virus isn’t real [end]
[start] It's arrogance. And yes you can have empathy for the arrogance of others. [end]
[start] They still Trump supporters now? [end]
[start] My parents are exactly the same and the ironic thing is my mom is ASIAN and AN IMMIGRANT like I wonder what goes through her head sometimes. But she is married to a racist white man so that kinda makes sense. It's so frustrating because whenever we go out they never wear their masks properly and could care less about the virus, they even call it the Chinese virus. We went to the city last weekend and they made my little brother take his masks of when we went to visit our stepgrandma and I was the only one who had a mask on. Like how fucking stupid and selfish can you be. Oh wait nvm they're trumpets. My mom has a store and she never has her mask on and never ask her customers to wear one and it's a law in our state to wear one or else you can go to jail. I hope that she gets fined so she learns a lesson. She can be sick and pass it to us without knowing like what im not about the catch corona because of your stupid ass. I'm just so tired of having to put up with their bs, one more year and im moving the hell away. [end]
[start] Fuck them fuckers, i'm glad someone said it. But we are dealing with this shit for so long already, that cases like this start appearing. [end]
[start] I don't give a flying fuck about these kinds of people they can go fuck themselves just like The  British Men of Letters from the tv show Supernatural. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Sounds like you’d feel better if they died... 🤷🏽‍♀️ [end]
[start] mask deniers are good people, i know because some of my friends and fam are them, theyve just been misled by a self-serving president [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] We need to open the entire country up, balls to the walls BUT we tell everyone who goes out  "you will get covid, and you will die." This way we have undeniable, irrefutable proof. Open the churches up, PLEASE!  We need to start culling the trump supporting lives. No sympathy, I hope they all die, painfully and alone. Deny science, eat shit. [end]
[start] Oh no your relatives have different political opinions than you lol. Go cry about it you sore loser, that’s exactly what you did here actually. Whining on Reddit like a pathetic little pansy, very pathetic.  TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 [end]

[TITLE] Fifty people were killed last night in a mass shooting in Orlando. Why am I not seeing this on reddit? [TITLE]
[start] It wasn't just "a mass shooting in the US" - it was THE mass shooting in the US. Worst mass shooting in US history.  ....and there's practically zero coverage on Reddit.  There was a live mega thread that was up while it was still happening but I don't see anything else. [end]
[start] Reddit you really disappointed me today.  Taking stories down about a major story makes me think, what other shit are you hiding from me? [end]
[start] Ah good, praise whatever entity you believe in that SOMEONE has posted about this.  I used to go to Reddit for all my news sources, then front page for the big stories and /r/news for most of the rest. However, there was NOT ONE thread on it to be found.  Did some digging, and it turns out that the /r/news mods have systematically deleted almost every single thread on the issue, bar their own megathread. Even that has ZERO news. Everything has been deleted by the mods, bar people shaming the mods for their cencorship. Don't believe me? Go here: [Orlando Shooting Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4nql8f/orlando_nightclub_shooting_megathread/)  Come on mods, get your shit together. Poeple are entitled to make racial judgements because whether you like it or not, this attack was on a very specific minority and it being widely praised by terror linked social media accounts.  Also, i had to go to /r/The_Donald to get up-to-date news on this story. Let that sink in. What. The. Fuck.  EDIT: With regard to censorship, this link shows the deleted comments from the /r/news megathread [link](https://unreddit.com/r/news/comments/4nql8f/orlando_nightclub_shooting_megathread/). Most of it has zero reason for deletion in it... What's the deal in there?  EDIT2: Corrected link from /r/TheDonald to /r/The_Donald, for those interested in seeing the insanity firsthand.  FINAL EDIT: /r/AskReddit is hosting the discussion right now [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4nqnrm/breaking_news_orlando_nightclub_massshooting/). [end]
[start] I could understand /r/news mods looking to prevent their sub from being flooded by incomplete news reports, but they're out of control over there.   Maybe it's malice, maybe it's just stupidity, but it's definitely a fuck up.  [end]
[start] Wow, if you send /r/news mods a PM expressing your disappointment about how they're removing content they instaban you for 72 hours.   -Here's some footage of the scene with gunshots that was linked on /r/bestoforldstar  https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofworldstar/comments/4nqaus/mass_shooting_pulse_orlando_florida_nightclub/ [end]
[start] I actually found out on Reddit [end]
[start] You know, I'm addicted to Reddit. I'll admit it. I spend most of my time browsing through memes and contributing. A year ago (maybe longer) reddit was my news source. Important events made it to the front page instantly and there would be helpful people in the comments updating a top post with relevant information.   My fiends and family have come to know me as the "person in the know" because of this. They'll call me to tell me something and I would be 10 steps ahead of them. They started calling me to know more because they knew I would've learned everything from Reddit that they weren't seeing.   Lately I've been having to tell them "I don't know" or "I haven't seen anything on it". Ever since the Pao scandal, the Reddit newsletter, the change in privacy terms, since certain default subs were changed hands Reddit has very very clearly changed. I'm starting to get my news from Facebook first. Or not finding news that others call me to ask about. There's no more updated posts with unbiased and up to date information anymore. (I've also noticed more downvotes and more vitriol lately too - like all the nice contributing users have disappeared) Reddit is now heavily encouraging users to use registered emails.   Reddit is fucked. The core beliefs are gone. The community try is gone. The info is curated. It's controlled. We are the ad revenue and the assets. There's a storyline being told here and it's not unbiased anymore. and today made that clear to me.  [end]
[start] The story was all over reddit when I woke up 3.5 hours ago. [end]
[start] [According to /r/undelete](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/4nqbb8/moderators_of_rnews_locking_any_post_having_to_do/), /r/news is censoring the threads because the shooter is brown. Absolutely disgusting. This is why Trump is doing so well. [end]
[start] Ive never seen Reddit in such an obviously corrupt state in nearly 8 years on this website. Something is seriously rotten here. [end]
[start] I was seeing news stories popping up, but nobody was allowed to comment, and all the prior comments were deleted. [end]
[start] >there's one article on news that was submitted about an hour ago on /r/news,  That would be the one saying he was a misogynst.  Because THAT is /newsworthy.  Misogyny is *the worst.* [end]
[start] https://www.reddit.com/r/USNEWS/comments/4nq9wk/orlando_nightclub_shooter_idd_as_us_citizen_omar/  https://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/4nper0/florida_pulse_gay_nightclub_attacked_in_orlando/  https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/4npycu/reports_of_nightclub_shooting_in_united_states/  https://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/duplicates/4nper0/florida_pulse_gay_nightclub_attacked_in_orlando/    [end]
[start] You are, its all over the place. [end]
[start] Aaron Swartz must be rolling in his grave. Talk about spitting in the face of the legacy of a man.  [end]
[start] I just unsubscribed from /r/news. I voted for Bernie Sanders and in no way support Trump, but had to go to the subreddit to actually get any real news about the attacks and the shooter. It's so fucked up that a subreddit about news can't even allow honest reports about news. I'm in disbelief that such a big sub could have such a blatant agenda and censor things that don't follow it. I won't subscribe again until the mods are completely replaced because as of now the mod team is a bunch of fucking asshats apparently. [end]
[start] A new story just broke about a person in LA arrested for planning to go to a LA pride rally: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4nr9fw/man_with_weapons_and_possible_explosives_arrested/  Of course since he is a white guy we can have an open discussion about bigotry, religion, homophobia and such. No worries, we can have the guy identified and people addressing misinformation and whatnot. But when the perpetrator is Muslim reddit goes into full lockdown.  It's pathetic. All sources of bigotry and violence need to be condemned, not make one fair game and the other completely taboo. Islamic motivated murderers are every bit as bad as Christian motivated murderers, and vice versa.  edit: people are already quick to heap shit on /r/The_Donald saying this is your typical Trump supporter and the kind of behaviour he espouses etc. Completely unfounded bullshit yet info about the guy in Orlando professing allegiance with freaking ISIS is censored. [end]
[start] I miss when Reddit was my go-to news source. Now I'm finding out about shit like this on Facebook first.  [end]
[start] People need to stop using reddit as a primary news source. If you care enough it takes a Google search to find info. You don't HAVE to go to Trump sub to get info. You are choosing to go there when you could get more info if you go read the news ON A NEWS SITE. Sucks that they are nuking comments in /news but when it becomes a cesspool mods are needed. [end]
[start] I don't know what you're talking about. /r/all is full of posts about this, I've been browsing for about 8 minutes and I'm still seeing posts about this, from every subreddit [end]
[start] Well, he was a radical, ISIS sympathizer, wife beater and anti-gay democrat. r/news has a problem with mentioning that  [end]
[start] Tfw /r/The_Donald is the bastion of free speech on reddit.  Wew what a time to be alive  [end]
[start] Here's the deal with reddit. It's run by mods who can filter content out for X, Y or Z. I don't know who runs the /r/news and /r/worldnews subs but they can sincerely suck my dick  [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] According to r/news they're censoring the influx of The_Donald supporters trying to make the story about a Muslim shooter. They shut down new posts because they were inundated with anti-muslim sentiment. If posts are about the shooting they are being let through. Let's remember the victims and not make it a political crusade. [end]
[start] It's the top post when I fire up Reddit. Not sure why it's not showing up on top for you or others. I guess it depends upon your settings? [end]
[start] People on Reddit take Reddit way too seriously.  [end]
[start] I don't understand their logic, do they honestly think that censoring this shit from one website is going to somehow bury it? has that ever worked in the history of the internet?   it accomplishes nothing but pissing us off. /news has always been shit, but I never bothered unsubscribing until today [end]
[start] >Today, Reddit lost a lot of credibility. It is not the front page of the internet. It is not a source for discussion and news events. It is not a place for free speech.  Why do people even still think this? Reddit lost this credibility years ago, I just come here for dank memes and to browse some subreddits. It's absolutely terrible for discussion or news [end]
[start] That one comment about how the world has become shit, it hasn't. This is a symptom of progress. Some people just wish to shackle themselves to the corpse of a dead age. Then they do things like this. They have already lost.  [end]
[start] SO MUCH CENSORPSHIP [end]
[start] Im not understanding???? There are people complaining about not seeing this newsnon reddit. I've been on reddit all night/day and there wasnt a moment when I did not see the story on the front page. [end]
[start] #standwithrdonald [end]
[start] Well a good reason why /r/news is losing subs really fast is because a mod told a user to kill them self. [end]
[start] Muslims dont kill people, guns kill people. ~Reddit mod agenda [end]
[start] > Shame on you, Admins. Shame on you, mods.  Having been on Reddit for a decade: Don't blame the admins.  They don't moderate the subreddits, nor do they remove topics - whenever something funky is going on in a subreddit, it's the moderators at work.  Admins remove users and subreddits that violate the rules (in addition to whatever they're required to remove after legal requests). [end]
[start] You know what, yeah. Reddit's creidibilty, and I speak as a gay man who is trying to find something about what happened, has tanked. Seriously tanked. [end]
[start] I definitely learned about it on reddit around 8:00am CST.  Not sure what you're going on about, maybe it's the subs you're subscribed to. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] News is censoring it and deleting it because it was revealed the shooter was Muslim. The Donald exposed it and it is now blowing up to huge proportions. [end]
[start] It's been the top post on all for 2 hours now. Since before your post. [end]
[start] It's all over /r/news now. Did they give up? [end]
[start] I saw like twenty posts about it wtf are you people talking about? [end]
[start] I'm quite literally seeing it everywhere. Open your goddamn eyes  [end]
[start] Reddit dares not to offend muslims [end]
[start] It's being censored because it was done by a muslim. Social justice. Not even once.  Isn't it incredible? One of the biggest shootings in US history and it's being actively censored so that fee fees are not hurt. [end]
[start] Why would /r/the_donald be trying to keep it off the front page? They are the ones all bragging about how /r/news is censoring because the guy is a muslim.  [end]
[start] Reddit shouldn't be your source for anything. [end]
[start] "Shame on you, Admins. Shame on you, mods." [end]
[start] There are two huge reasons.  **The algorithm**  Reddit's visibility algorithm hasn't kept up with the amount of users. Even though it tries its best to help new submissions on the front page (upvotes on new posts count many times more than those on old posts), the huge amount of users upvoting already visible posts has rendered this much less important than it used to be. Now it takes substantially longer for Reddit to catch up to recent events than before.   **The moderators**  Moderators on several major subreddits do not want Reddit to be the place that gets in the news for a huge wave of bigoted or inaccurate posts. This has happened before (see: Boston bombers), and they do everything in their power at any cost to avoid negative publicity. They are currently in overkill mode, removing anything that resembles bigoted views.  So, this has lead to...  **The controversy:**  Obviously, removing that many posts - often for very light reasons - is indeed very much censorship. Redditors do not like that word in the slightest. They (we) are not seeing the news they (we) want, and would prefer for the mods *not* to suppress posts just because it makes them look good in the media. Even though much of the posts that mods are blocking are very unaccurate and bigoted indeed, many of us would rather like to see those posts for any information they might contain. [end]
[start] ITT: Cognitive dissonance regarding /r/the_donald's coverage of the mass shootings and attacks against their community and beliefs.  [end]
[start] Mass censorship by tolerant liberals, not surprising. Disgraceful.  [end]
[start] Why the FUCK would anyone delete comments about blood donations and edit the votes so it doesn't reach the front page? Not many things on the internet anger me but this takes the fuckin cake. Does anyone know why they're doing this!?  I don't understand.  [end]
[start] Why?  Because. M U S L I M and registered Democrat. That's why.  [end]
[start] Welcome to Reddit, full of liberals so PC any news of Islam is immediately censored. [end]
[start] As soon as the fact that the shooter was a Muslim, all the degenerate mods started deleting and purging threads and comments to cover it up.  The same thing happens with all the mass rapes and murders in Europe committed by Muslims. The fact that 1400 girls in Rotherham, UK were drugged and kidnapped and raped for years and that the police and local government knew about it and did nothing goes to show how culpable the mainstream left is in aiding the most barbaric crimes seen in decades. The police report about mass assaults in Cologne was covered up by the government until it was leaked and spread around the internet.  Reddit is that censor [end]
[start] if you think reddit is cenorship free, you haven't been paying attention, I first saw how bad it was during the gamergate crap [end]
[start] Today among all this censorship; I often think of  former reddit founder Aaron swartz (rip) and his major attempts to change and break down the Internet censorship. His death is put  in vain today by the mods of these boards.  [end]
[start] Because this will obviously turn anti Islamic. And you know what? GOOD! FUCK Islam. 50 people were murdered by an Islamic extremist with ties to Isis. I don't give a flying FUCK if the 'good' Muslims get offended by justified anti Islamic comments. Now is not the time to worry about their feelings. FUCK Islam.  [end]
[start] Last night my police scanner app was telling me over 10,000 people were listening to the scanner in Orlando. I didn't see any news about it until one of the /r/AskReddit mods posted it there of all places. [end]
[start] I actually only found out about this now through this post. Don't see any related posts on /r/worldnews either (not even in /new). Pretty weird. [end]
[start] Thank you for posting this - it was the first I heard of this.  Can't believe what is going on with Reddit today..  [end]
[start] I had to change it to show all [end]
[start] https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4nqnrm/breaking_news_orlando_nightclub_massshooting/ [end]
[start] The mods are useless craps there, and the admins also useless sellouts who don't do their job anymore.  /r/news could have new mods by having the admins remove existing ones. But the admins are just as useless [end]
[start] worldnews (wasn't)isn't reporting it.  I saw it socialism of all places.  Askreddit has it now. /r/news has it.   /r/politics didn't have it. [end]
[start] It's actively being censored because the shooter was an Islamic terrorist. [end]
[start] At this point, I feel like major defaults like /r/news should be controlled by the admins rather than unaffiliated moderators.  [end]
[start] Reddit is a very censored website these days.  [end]
[start] It's because the shooter wasn't a white male who listened to Rush Limbaugh every day  [end]
[start] I like how users on /r/news say it's because of Muslim mods and people on /r/kotakuinaction claim it to be sjw mods.  [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Why have I not seen anything about it on /r/all. TV is actually better for breaking news now, don't know the last time that happened. [end]
[start] When I did a youtube geosearch I also found that in orlando some dude shot and killed a popular youtuber/singer at a signing after her concert. https://www.youtube.com/user/zeldaxlove64/videos   So much fucked up shit happens every day that you'll never hear about. [end]
[start] You must be blind. [end]
[start] Mass censorship from some major subreddits, especially r/news, because the attacker was a Muslim. [end]
[start] I've always come to reddit for news when some major event happens but today absolutely zero coverage. Nothing being allowed through anyway.  Gone are the days where a maior story would be top of /all within the hour.  Sad day for everyone and a major milestone in the decline of this website as a go to place for breaking news. [end]
[start] I'm not really seeing anything as to WHY though. I see stuff about mods and admins and what have you but WHY? It doesn't makes sense to me that Reddit would try to hide this story. Can someone explain? [end]
[start] I am done with Reddit after the election in November. [end]
[start] I learned about the shooting on Instagram, went immediately to Reddit to find information and saw nothing. Unbelievable.  [end]
[start] Yeah. I have seen some posts about it on some smaller threads, but why isn't it everywhere?    I dont mind the r/floridaman sub saying don't post it because it distracts for the seriousness of the event.   I am actually proud of the_donald... Never thought I'd say it.   Anyway RAoP had a thread on it too but not default and not even a news sub.   Do you know if there is anyway someone in another state can help out? [end]
[start] Probably because all the threads about it are being brigaded by "gas em all" white supremacists [end]
[start] Censoring man. People have an agenda unfortunately and really really wanted the shooter to be a white male  [end]
[start] A radio app alerted me. Since it's usually junk it tells me to tune into, I was shocked at what it was reporting. First instinct was to come to Reddit remembering the Paris attacks updates. The resources and references to support are insane. I never really look at how quick it can all be silenced. [end]
[start] It was on the front page earlier. You must have missed it. [end]
[start] Children mentality that just don't get it.   Waiting to make a hundred jokes and get that karma.   [ Scared to post something](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...) that don't reap karma.  [end]
[start] I just submitted a question to Explain to me like I'm 5. "What's the difference between a mass shooting and a mass murder?"  My post was removed because "it had to do with a current situation".   Now why would a mod do that, even if the question may not have to be about current events? [end]
[start] Reddit mods and admins don't believe in freedom of speech.  Honestly, I've only ever met 1 or 2 good mods, out of thousands.  It's really sad to see this place being controlled so heavily. If you didn't believe that people push their own agenda and use reddit as a form of propaganda, well here's your sign.   There is only one sub that supports freedom and that's /r/freefreefreedom  Created by yours truly. Doesnt have any activity though lol [end]

[start] The moment Islam was mentioned in the news thread, shit exploded faster than the mods could handle it, I'd imagine. So they'd have to come together and decide on a course of action. So, mega thread that they could watch easier. Mega thread gets down vote bombed by the Donald, mostly, so lacks visibility. They apparently proceed to delete anything on Islam because most comments following are just intense hatred and take away from the tragedy. Meanwhile the Donald takes over the news on /r/all frothing at the mouth about Muslims. All in all a complete shit show. [end]
[start] [Happy Ramadan, lads!](http://imgur.com/yaPwS5x) [end]
[start] My wife woke me up this morning talking about the shooting.  Oh, guess I should check Reddit.  After twenty minutes of digging, I find the /r/news megathread (graveyard of forgotten comments), and a post from the mods talking about how the subreddit is deducted to censorship for some unseen reason?  Really?  [end]
[start] The fuck are you talking about? I saw it on Reddit last night when it was still happening. Hell, I heard about it from Reddit first. Just because one shitty subreddit censored posts about it doesn't mean it hasn't been here.  Shocker, checked out the history, OP is a The_Donald poster trying to play up the "SAFESPACE MUSLIM LIBERAL CENSORSHIP HURRR" angle.  [end]
[start] It has been all over reddit from the second he started shooting. Fuck the donald for spamming shitposts, no wonder we can't read any real news anymore. Real people aren't making these posts, it's hired for minimum wage spammers. None of them make sense. It is spam in the purest form.  I've been going elsewhere for my news. I'm sure other big sites are picking up. Yahoo is pretty non partisan.  [end]
[start] /r/the_donald is in a very (or nor so much depending on how you see it) demanding a witch hunt and this concerns me greatly [end]
[start] This is absolutely disgusting. I feel like a hole has opened up in my stomach. How can someone come in and just shoot 103 people? I dont get it. I dont think I ever will.  [end]
[start] You... Are exactly right, OP. This is surprising, even for Reddit. [end]
[start] I saw a lot of articles since I got up this morning so not sure what you aren't seeing. Though it appears some of it may have been getting censored after it came out that some second generation afghani fuck did it. I have auto-hide after voting enabled so I'm unaware if the earlier reports were deleted. [end]
[start] Because it's being banned everywhere.  It doesn't fit the rhetoric that is more important than anything else to maintain despite reality.  Only news is on r/ thedonald. Once it became known he was a Muslim radical and self proclaimed supporter of Isis.  That didn't fit the accepted dialogue so it has to be silenced.  [end]
[start] >Today, Reddit lost a lot of credibility. It is not the front page of the internet. It is not a source for discussion and news events. It is not a place for free speech.  Welcome to 2010. It's been like this for years.  [end]

[start] Hey man,  Because of your post I just sent my girlfriend a cute text and I'm sure that lots of others reading your post have done the same.  The love between you and your wife has actually created *more* love today - that's something special. [end]
[start] You gained a new memory from someone important to you who has passed. As bittersweet as it may seem, that is a gift, friend. I'm sorry for your loss. [end]

[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] 6 years ago my lovely wife passed away after 27 years of marriage. I spent close to a year basically drinking it all away. (ProLifeTip: Don't do that!) It's been a slow process. You don't realize just how many little things can sneak up and blow dust around the room.   Our 3 nieces were "hers" and she made me promise to deliver jewelry she picked out for them on their 16th birthdays. I have one more to go. It's the only time I bother to go to her grave. I figure the good memories outweigh the need to go to a symbol but those "delivery" days draw me there.  When I clutch up, gasp a bit, and want explode in screams of anguish, I see her face and remember one of the last things she said:  Don't be sad because it's ending. Be happy that it happened. [end]
[start] I'm sorry for your loss, sexybutt. [end]
[start] Frame the note, and keep it somewhere to remember.    It is ok to miss her. [end]
[start] I worry about my mother.  My dad died a couple of weeks ago, and she has practically spent the last 30 years of her life just taking care of him in one way or another.  Their whole lives revolved around each other.  When my dad would get off work, he'd go and sit and wait for my mom to get off work.  If he decided to go home, he would wait eagerly until she came home.  And vice versa.  Now that he's gone, I'm worries about what she will do with herself.  And I figure she's going to find one of his handwritten notes soon.... [end]
[start] “Alright, here goes. I’m old. What that means is that I’ve survived (so far) and a lot of people I’ve known and loved did not. I’ve lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can’t imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here’s my two cents.  I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don’t want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don’t want it to “not matter”. I don’t want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gorged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can’t see.  As for grief, you’ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you’re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it’s some physical thing. Maybe it’s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it’s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.  In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don’t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you’ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what’s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything…and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.  Somewhere down the line, and it’s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O’Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you’ll come out.  Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don’t really want them to. But you learn that you’ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you’ll survive them too. If you’re lucky, you’ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.”  I think you just survived a big one. [end]
[start] Those little memories are great things. Sometimes it's good to remember people exactly the way they were when you loved them and not just the memory they've become since their passing.  Keep it and look at it when you need to. She wanted you to smile when you found it and that hasn't changed just because she's not around you in person.  [end]
[start] You're not supposed to forget her. Keep that and hang it up somewhere. Sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] A similar thing happened to me. My father passed away after a stroke 13 years ago now. It devastated me as he died the day after my 19th birthday.  He had leased a car before he passed and I started driving the car until the lease ran out. One day a few months later, I was cleaning out the car and found some papers in the glove box. It was a letter from my dad the recounted all of my accomplishments in sports and in life. All the way back to kindergarten. He went on and on about all the memories. It was amazing. Sports was our thing. He loved coaching and I loved playing. At the end he thanked me for making my mom and him proud by being a great teammate and good person. He wished me luck as I began the next chapter of my life. College and college football. He thanked me for a lifetime of memories and asked that I continue to try my best at whatever I did. I read the letter a few times a year. I still hear his voice reading it to me.   Enjoy the little surprise reminders you will find over the next while in regards to your wife. I'm sorry to hear of your loss.  [end]
[start] Fuck. I was not prepared to tear up when I read this. There I am, in line at the bank getting my Reddit on, and when it's my turn I find myself all bleary eyed looking at the teller. [end]
[start] My husband has a habit of writing little notes all over the house as well. He scribbled in light pencil on the walls in secret small corners. He died over two years ago from an aggressive & fast moving cancer.   I was cleaning the baseboards of my living room several months after he passed away, and in a corner of the room, in his handwriting it read, "you will see this someday" I was overwhelmed with emotions upon seeing this; I was already on the floor because I was cleaning it. I don't know how long I stayed there sobbing. I don't know if I will find more notes from him; Its a big house and he was notorious for doing things like this.  I never minded his whimsy, and now- I love it all the more that he did these things, they will always make me overwhelmed with emotions, but whose to say thats so bad? He was here, we loved each other, it was wonderful, I am raising our son, he is so like him and he never really got to know his father.   Maybe I will find more scribbles.  [end]
[start] I can somewhat relate, I lost my girlfriend a little over 6 months ago. I'm now 27 and she would have been 23. The amount of things like this, whether memories or physical reminders that can trigger these kind of emotions are almost countless. I've gone from having a totally normal day to an absolute sob-fest in a matter of seconds, many times.  I've come to find peace in different ways, but the one that really stuck is not to look at your lost ones life as a loss anymore, but as a positive embodiment of memories you hold tight and cherish. Their life, although shorter than most, was lived completely and you were able to be a part of it. Even though it wasn't as long as most, it was a life time by definition. You were the one she chose to love and love to me is eternal. Just because the vessel that reciprocated that love is no longer here doesn't mean we can't still love. I don't know about you, but if or when I do choose to love another, that will never detract or take away from that love once shared.  Best wishes to you, my friend. The road we walk is less traveled, but not impossible. Carry her with you in everything you do. [end]
[start] **Internet bro hug** [end]
[start] There is something prolifically horrific about losing someone you planned on having around and building a life with, you will always carry a piece of her with you no matter what you go through, I can't imagine the overwhelming feeling you must encounter on a daily basis. Find fortitude and strength in knowing that is true love, the day will come where you are comfortable using this to love again. Not a matter of replacement just a deep profound sense of understanding true love. Don't treat it like a stranger welcome it, use it to be the man she would want you to be.   -- "Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday."  **- John Wayne** [end]
[start] I'm sorry to hear that. I can't even imagine your level of emotion. It's truly a bittersweet moment I guess. [end]
[start] I hope you feel better dude, even imagining that makes me want to curl up and cry.  [end]
[start] Sorry for what you're going though. It's been four years since my [Beverly](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/b9jfa/this_is_where_we_can_put_personal_things_and_i/) died. One of the things that help me a lot was my 'Grief Group' that one of my co-workers marched me into at (figurative) gunpoint.  This I can almost promise you - It will get better, as unbelievable now as it seems.  It will take time and some effort on your part, but with that it will get better.  I didn't believe that either, but it does. At least it did for me and most of the 12 people in my Grief Group. Faster for some, slower for others (me), it really helps.  Consider finding and getting involved with a Grief Support Group of some kind. Nearly all communities of size have a few to several. Most are free or donation supported, some church/religion affiliated, many others not. We are not taught how to deal with such as this, there is no manual.   There is no 'wrong' way to handle it - except not to.  "I am so sorry" from a digital friend probably doesn't help much, but I am sorry.  Find a group and get involved, even an online group - I would not have survived Beverly's death without mine.  http://forums.grieving.com/  http://www.dmoz.org/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement/Support_Groups/  http://griefnet.org/support/sg2.html   [end]
[start] That is brutal, I don't know what I would do if I lost my wife she is such a big part of me. I guess eventually I will have to deal with grief, it is the cost of love.   Can I ask what happened? I have a 2.5 year old and I am always freaked to hear young people die (assuming young because Reddit) and I have life insurance....but I don't want my son to be that kid who lost his dad at 8 and is never the same.  [end]
[start] I'm so sorry for your loss.  For some reason this Nietzsche quote popped into my mind when I read your post:  “What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.”  My English teacher once told me you cannot experience great sadness without great happiness; that happiness and sadness are different sides of the same coin (much like passion and hate).  The sadness you feel now is a reminder of the great times you had together; and you should cherish both dearly.  Best of luck to you my friend. [end]
[start] You should cry and lose your shit a little bit. You deserve to.   It's not the same but when my wife left me, I went through some tough shit. She took my 2 step-kids that I had raised for 7 years and moved them 7 hours away with a "we'll really will stay in touch," promise that never panned out. I aged 10 years in a summer.   The kids had been staying with their biological dad for a few weeks in the summer. She left me near the end of their stay, and they never got to come back home. She knew she was going to do it too. And she never let on that when I said goodbye to them weeks earlier, it was goodbye for real. Having what is basically your entire family ripped from your life in an instant really hurts. It really, really hurts.  I went completely manic for weeks, cleaning and fixing everything. I guess in the back of my mind, our place wasn't good enough. It was all she ever complained about. If I can fix everything here, she might come back. She might bring the kids back and put everything back to normal again. She never did. Months later, when I finally got the nerve to clean out their rooms and pack everything that had been left behind, I lost it.   Long story short, I did get better, and find happiness again. There's still a spot in me that gets choked up now and then but concentrating on positive projects that I like to do, and feeling good about everything I've got going for me now gives me the energy to keep going, and to be happy and hopeful.   I should have used a throwaway account for this one, but I hope it helps you in some small way.   EDIT: This summer will mark year five, and though I'm dissatisfied with some things in my life, mostly career related, I can honestly say I'm in a good place. [end]
[start] it gets better.  [end]
[start] I'm truly sorry for your loss. I honestly can't begin imagine what that must feel like. Cry and laugh as much you need to.  [end]
[start] OP, chances are this is gonna get buried but I hope you see this. I'm 21 and have battled cancer my whole life - leukemia. Getting married was a luxury I didn't think I'd ever have, but alas the fates were kind for a time. I lost my husband three years ago in a car accident and it rattled my world. We spent everyday like it was our last because it was very much a possibility with us. I kept a journal that I wrote to him in every single day and when he passed away and I moved back to California I placed that journal into a box and allowed it to slip my mind. After reading your post, I choked up a little, dug in my closet and pulled out the box. When I opened it I found my journal and all the cards and notes he left me throughout our time together - we liked hiding notes around the house too. It was in my journal all the way at the back that I found a letter he had tucked in for me when I finally got to writing in the last section of the book. I cried like a baby! Thank you. After three years, I still hurt for him like it was yesterday but you gave me some of the happiness we had. I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you find the peace you need to go through your wife's things, it will be difficult but you will remember things you didn't even know you forgot. Thank you. For posting this, for having such an amazing woman in life who can still affect people and for helping many couples. Peace and blessings to you OP :)  [end]
[start] Put that Post-it where you won't lose it. And have an interwebs hug.  [end]
[start] i am sorry for your loss.   live your life the way she would want you to.  [end]
[start] Sounds like a great wife. My condolences. [end]
[start] I am so sorry for you loss, my friend. I sobbed while reading this, I am pretty sick and there isnt much hope of me getting better, I just cant bare to know what it will be like to leave my fiance, my best friend behind. I'd want him to be happy and smile and enjoy life. But I know that it won't be like that. At least not right away. I am so sorry for you. I hope that when I leave my SO, he treasures and remembers the goodtimes. I am sure it make her day, that second you smiled, wherever she is. [end]
[start] Im in Vancouver if you want to have a beer.  No idea where you are...but thought I would try. [end]
[start] Man, that's crazy. I lost my mother a few months ago and now reading your post, if I ever found a note from her to me I'd probably lose my shit. Cherish that note though and keep it. [end]
[start] I had to find one of my favorite books Man’s Search For Meaning, By: Viktor Frankl to cite a passage from it because it sounds similar to your suffering. “Let me cite a clear-cut example: Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his severe depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now, how could I help him? What should I tell him? I refrained from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, ‘What would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?’ ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!’ Whereupon I replied, ‘You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this suffering—to be sure, at the price now you have to survive and mourn her.’ He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my office. In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.” –P.113 This book has helped me cope with some very difficult things in life, and I hope it helps you too.  [end]
[start] leaving hidden sticky notes = fun and cute  Your wife was obviously an amazing person. [end]
[start] I welled up a bit at this, thinking about being in your situation losing my s/o. You must be incredibly strong to be going through this. Try your hardest to keep your head up.  [end]
[start] You should frame that post-it. [end]
[start] I recently lost my wife a few months ago as well, and I know what you mean when it's easier to talk to strangers than your own family sometimes.  [end]
[start] INTERNET BRO HUG ENGAGE. [end]
[start] Sorry to hear about your loss.  Seems like you had a very beautiful thing.  Perhaps just recognize that, put it in a special box, and be open to other experiences. [end]
[start] I'm so sorry, that probably triggered a ton of old memories and feelings. She did that for your out of love though so keep that thought with you that her love is still with you and you can press on no matter what. Be brave, be strong and keep on keeping on. [end]
[start] We're always here, man.  Take care. [end]
[start] My wife and I "Post-It" each other all the time, usually something like "hey I made banana bread, it's above the fridge hiding from the devil cats :P"  but sometimes we will hide them for a better reaction.  This hit me right in the feels:(   [end]
[start] Reading letters from the deceased is equal parts a blessing and torture, depending on your mood when you choose to read them.  Almost a year ago I posted on reddit about a time capsule my mother created for me when I was a child, that I was able to open when I graduated highschool, 10 years after she died. The most special moment of my whole life.  Find a way to protect that note forever. It's something you should never be without. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] My husband passed away when we were 31. Very sudden and tragic. The first year is the hardest, but I promise you that it does get easier. It's hard to imagine, but it does. I just passed the 3-year anniversary in November and I finally feel like my life makes sense again. And when I remember him now, it's with so much love and positivity, and the pain in my heart is not nearly as bad. I miss him dearly but am full of so much goodness because of the life we shared. I hope you find some comfort and can open your heart to the beauty in the world surrounding you. That's what keeps me going. And always, always remember the little things you shared with a smile... [end]
[start] And I'm crying. [end]
[start] Sadly your new username is already claimed: http://www.reddit.com/user/sexybutt  one post two years ago. Maybe the owner of the account could be convinced to give it up. [end]
[start] I have a jam jar that's nearly full of sticky notes my girlfriend has hidden around my desk/room/pockets/carrying cases over the relatively short 3 years we've been together. We're still young so it's hard to think that far ahead, but I know I'll hold onto them forever. [end]
[start] Every upvote is a hug from a stranger. We all share your grief.  [end]
[start] Have you ever considered finding that note a sign that shes still around? I know that thought could be lame to some but its those little things that make you wonder. Thats her reaching out- relaying that playful message and telling you she has never left you :) [end]
[start] definite tears from this redditor.  keep smiling, sexybutt!  [end]
[start] I lost my mom in august after caring for her for a few years.  Everyday I feel like i didn't do enough, that I could've done more and it makes me very depressed.  It also makes me angry that I feel this way.  I'm very confused and I don't want to bother my friends with my feelings.  I suppose it's nice sometimes to anonymously post when you're feeling emotional and have no one to turn to.  I don't know, I'm feeling real down.  Just found out my Dad has prostate cancer (which I know has a very high survival rate, but still) and my Grandpa has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (dx: not good).  We need a hug. [end]
[start] FUCK, REDDIT. I CANT POSSIBLY HOLD ALL THESE FEELS. [end]
[start] I had a gf that passed away in college suddenly from a car wreck.  I had a stuffed animal of hers that she would sleep with every night that I had bought for her.  When she had passed, I too had took over sleeping duties with the bear and eventually it lost her scent but gained mine.  Made me so upset when I realized what I had done.  A year or so later, the sound of her voice had begin to fade from memory.  Devastated me that the love of my life's voice had faded.  It has been over 10 years now.  I have had a small amount of girlfriends since her and have even been engaged.  But no one will ever come close to how much I love that woman.  The pain doesnt go away.  You just learn to live with it.  Dont forget the one you gave your soul too.  I know I wont.  RIP Candice.  I miss you.  I wish you all the best.  And I totally agree, with being able to vent to someone new.  I know friends and family are always there for you, but you know that after a while they get tired of hearing about your story.  But on the internet, there is always someone new to share it with. [end]
[start]  It will continue to happen.  The first year is the hardest; statistically, a major event-driven depression averages only about 13 months.  But after that, you still hit those little moments fairly often for years to come.  Sometimes you'll look at the calendar and realize it's a birthday or an anniversary of something important, like your first date or her death.  And you won't have realized it -- it won't be marked on your daybook, but you'll see an "August 13th" out of the corner of your eye, and you'll have a flashback to a movie theater or a beach or a hospital, and you're right there again.   It happens less often over time -- it's been nearly five years for me, and it happens, but less often and less severely.  I'll see a thing that I got from her or start singing a song and realize I once sang it to her, and suddenly I'm thinking about it again.  The difference between grieving and drowning in grief is in how long it takes you to stop thinking about it and start thinking about other things.  That first year, you're drowning and no one can reasonably expect anything different -- you can't read a book or have a conversation for long without your focus going back to the loss.  Diversion from the pain is the exception... which is one reason why you might find yourself drinking heavily, jumping off bridges, or otherwise trying to subvert your ability to think entirely.  That's ok; it's natural and you should expect it -- not to feel abjectly imbalanced would make you either more or less than human.  You've lost a part of yourself; it would be odd if you did feel like yourself at all.   But it won't last forever.  Whether you find a note from her and you immediately throw it away like a hot coal, or you cling it to yourself and weep over every word for a few hours, it doesn't really matter much -- you're just going down a hard road by yourself, and no one else can tell you what is or isn't the right way to go.  You should take comfort from the fact that you've made it as far as you have, and you should draw confidence from the fact that you can make it -- everyone does.  Everyone in life either loses someone or is himself lost so early that he doesn't get a chance.  Most people don't when they're young, in their 20's and 30's, but most people do eventually.  And they do make it through, and so will you.   But nothing makes it easier except time.  Luckily, you've got nothing but -- as a society, we've moved away from any widely-acknowledge protocol on grief or sorrow (used to be you could wear black for a year and a day), and in the absence of an accepted protocol, you can basically do whatthehellever you want and no one can criticize you much.  At any rate, anyone who does criticize you is someone you can safely set on fire; no one's going to miss that guy.  Find what works for you -- counseling, church, working out, writing bad poetry, drinking, strip bars, anything that you can pour attention into without putting yourself or anyone else in danger -- and let yourself heal.  You won't notice when it starts to happen, but it will eventually. [end]
[start] Nobody makes me cry my own tears. NOBODY!!!!! [end]
[start] I lost my best friend a little over two years ago and it's hard not to miss them everyday. Just know that love will never go away and keep all those memories close to your heart. Just think how amazing it is that you found that note and that she can still make you smile! Hang in there man. Time heals all wounds, replace the sorrow of loss with all the love and fond memories!  [end]
[start] Dude, my heart breaks in to a thousand pieces when I imagine a life without my wife. I am certain that were I to lose her, I would immediately kill myself - the thought of going on without her for even one day is too much to bear, my heart goes out to you and believe me I know how lucky I am to have her. [end]
[start] Throwing it out there, I read a [comic with a similar situation](http://i.imgur.com/dog27.jpg) involving Animal Crossing that you might find interesting. I'm truly sorry about your loss. [end]
[start] sexybutt... right in the feels. [end]
[start] This may sound absolutely crazy, but i'd love to hear about your love together if you live in Seattle. Coffee or beer or Paseo. On me.  I'm so sorry . [end]
[start] Take care man, bro hug! [end]
[start] > I'd managed to keep myself together for the most part over the past month  Don't try to keep yourself together every day. Some days, just say fuck it and let the tears and laughter flow. Life and responsibility will still be there tomorrow when you pick yourself up out of bed and go about your day.  [end]
[start] Oh god, man. I want to give you a big hug so badly. You can get through this, and you can be happy again.  So, so sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] My god, that's a punch in the stomach. I can't even imagine how you must feel.  [end]
[start] Life is temporary, hug a loved one today. Sorry for your loss man, and thanks for the inspiration. I'm going to do something nice for my lady friend today.  [end]
[start] Oh God. Too many feels. Trying to hide tears at my desk now. My worst nightmare is my husband dying. I'm sorry for your loss OP   *internet hug* [end]
[start] Sympathy, my brother. Sincerely. I hope this helps you as well as it helped me:   Most grieving people struggle desperately to "get over" the loss of a loved one. This is a mistake. You will *never* get over the death of one who was so important to you. Instead of trying to overcome your loss, simply focus on *getting used to it*. Approach this not as something you must overcome, but rather as something you *will* eventually get used to; something that has added to who you are despite the pain.    Your lovely wife was lucky to have been do deeply loved and so keenly missed. Eventually, as you begin to get used to her absence, you will recognise how lucky you are to have had this extraordinary woman in your life.    Peace, my brother. Be patient with yourself, please. I promise you it does get easier and you will get used to it.   [end]
[start] This thread made me laugh and cry all at once. My roommate probably thinks im insane.  I hope someone loves me like that someday :/  [end]
[start] I know this doesn't help but I am truly sorry for your loss. My sister lost her fiancé last year. They were both in their mid-twenties and had been together since high school. She was so lost after he passed away and I stayed by her side, moved in with her so she could keep their house, and was there for practically every tear.  I learned so much from that experience. it's the little moments that matter. Take it one day at a time and try to not worry about the far off future. Avoid the "what ifs" because all they being is pain. Don't be afraid to cry. It's times like these when nobody knows what to say but they want to say something to comfort you.  Take care of yourself please. Don't forget to eat or that life goes on. I wish I could say that was your last painful reminder but in all honesty you're going to always find her around you in so many different ways. Stay strong and know that you're never truly alone cuz I'm sure her favorite place was by your side and in so many ways she's still there. [end]
[start] Sometimes, when you look in the corners of the internet, there are in fact good people.  [end]

[start] I'm about to ask my gf to marry me here in a few weeks and she does this for me all the time, I love it and I'm gonna go home tonight and give her a big hug. If you feel like it please share a few stories or reasons your wife gave you those notes. Those are the best moments. I'm so very sorry for your loss [end]
[start] Sounds to me like it was meant to play out this way.   While I don't personally know either of you,   I would like to think that this is her way of letting you know that she still loves you and cares about you and that she wants you to keep your head up and keep smiling.   This love IS a beautiful thing. And it will last forever.  But for now, keep your head up and keep that smile she loves on your face.   Feel better!  Much love and a GIANT Internet hug from your friendly neighborhood Internet stranger!  [end]
[start] If you don't mind my asking, how did she die? Accident, natural causes? [end]
[start] I have notes in my wallet from my ex fiancee, just can't seem to throw them, not yet anyway. [end]

[start] It could just be the detoxing, but I'm crying too. [end]
[start] Hang in there, brother. Things will get better. [end]
[start] Best of luck! [end]
[start] Wow stuff like that must hit you like a freight train. I'm so sorry for your loss. My wife and I have the same kind of post-it thing going on in our marriage. It's funny how such cute little notes can brighten up your day. I can't imagine how hard it would be to find a random one like that after she passed. Hang in there buddy. [end]
[start] I can't even fathom this. Really sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] Just remember, you do not start to heal from the loss of a loved one because time passes; you begin to heal because of what you do with the time...  [end]
[start] I am so very sorry. I am not religious in the least but this made me think of that maybe she really is thinking of you right now and continues on somewhere else. Maybe she is letting you know it is ok to smile and remember the joy you shared without it being tinged with grief.   She will always be with you and you with her. Words are wind as they say but they can sometimes help, even a little. [end]

[start] It sounds silly, and most people on here would disagree, but I think you should take it as a sign.  We have no evidence to the contrary, so if I were you, I would take this as a message from your wife telling you she wants you to smile.  [end]
[start] Today, I shed a tear for a fellow Redditor. That has never happened. Here, have all the internet hugs. I can't imagine what you're going through. [end]
[start] 5 months on Reddit.  First time welling up.  Bro-hugs from Brisbane, Australia. [end]
[start] Mr. Sexybutt, I came here to give you a hug...*internet hug*.  [end]
[start] I'd frame it, save it, we always say we remember the big memories but for me, with loss, it's the little ones that really make me smile. Stay strong sexybutt,  [end]
[start] I hope you find more just when you need it most. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] You will see her again. [end]
[start] My wife is alive, and this post is still making me sad. [end]
[start] I am so sorry for your loss.  Hang in there bud.    My dad died about 9 months ago.  He is still my emergency contact at work because he was when I started here 28 years ago, and I just can't change it.  He drove me up here for my first day of work.  Paid for some suits.  Helped pay for a place to live until the first paychecks came through.  I can't change it yet.  I have tried.  I am shaking now just thinking about it. [end]
[start] This made me sad - at the same time restored my faith in humanity. Even though we are all strangers, all these people came out to support and share their stories...   Well played internet....Well played. [end]
[start] This is amazing, I know you'll probably never get to this but if you do I think it might relate. Its a scene from Good Will Hunting between Matt Damon and Robin Williams talking about idiosyncrasies. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvvx-0G7XHc [end]
[start] Thank you, the world needs more love. [end]
[start] Out of all the things I have seen on the internet, This is the one thing that made me cry manly tears. It has truly made me think of the things I take for granted in life. I am truly sorry for your loss, and I thankful for reminding me of what is truly important in life. Always remember and cherish all the time you can spend with your loved ones. [end]
[start] Hold onto that smile she gave you. [end]
[start] All 16,543 down voters of this can jump off a bridge [end]
[start] Wow man .. This is truly touching .  Im on break at work and IM teary eyed ..  I can tell you are a humble person .. Just like your wife would want you to be .. thanks so much for this post .  [end]
[start] That's so beautiful.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  You will always have those very special memories and a note that will make you smile forever.  [end]
[start] I still think about you and this post you shared with Reddit. I hope you are well, OP.  [end]
[start] Grieving is pain at a future made a bit less bright by someone's absence and a little glimpse that reminded you how bright it all was renews some of that pain. But she wasn't quite so absent today and that's good plus you have a sexy butt, so you got that going for you, which is nice. [end]
[start] Your wife sounds awesome [end]
[start] I am so sorry. Stay strong. And take this hug /hug  Also, I know this sounds stupid, but my mom and I always keep those little notes. Handwriting is such a personal attribute, it's easy to remember those people we lost when we see something so theirs - like a note like that. Keep those memories alive, and she will always live in your heart and mind. /one more hug [end]
[start] Oh jeez, I got to 'I found...' and my eyes welled up.  Brohug. Tight brohug. [end]
[start] I wish I had the words to soften some of your grief.  It's hard knowing that either you will lose your loved one, or they will lose you but this shows that a loving gesture can reach through time and space.   [end]
[start] I know I can't say or understand how it is to lose a wife but if it's any condolence I do think back to all my past relationships that have come and gone and reflect and remember and love that person for the good times we had and try to forget the bad times. It's better to have love and experienced great things then to have regretted never trying. [end]
[start] It doesnt get any easier... I'm so sorry.  Treasure that note and store it in a safe place... [end]
[start] I was listening to a random playlist and Joshua Radin - Closer came on as I read this.  I am so sad now :(  I'm sorry for your loss but try take positives out of it!   I can't imagine how emotional that would have been to discover that... [end]
[start] My heart goes out to you, brother. Keep on keeping on. [end]
[start] I cant even begin to know what your going through. couldn't imagine. makes me appreciate all the little notes my girl and I leave laying around. Its been awhile. think I will write one now, and sneak it into her apron pocket. Thanks for sharing with us. [end]
[start] It's sweet and it's sad. Just feel those feelings. Thanks for sharing with us. [end]
[start] Awww, buddy.  *hugs* [end]
[start] I'm so sorry for your loss :( [end]
[start] I know what you mean about being able to post it here rather than talking to your family.    I haven't experienced the kind of sorrow you're experiencing, but I've known pain. You're not alone. One day you'll be able to keep her memory alive without it derailing you completely but in the meantime that's perfectly acceptable and probably healthy.     I hope you kept the post-it. Down the line, if you didn't, I bet you'll wish you had. Take care man. [end]
[start] Hang in there mate, loss is so hard, that's the way of life. I really wish I could help you deal with this, but I just want you to stay happy. She'll always be in your thoughts, and hey, I don't know if you're religious, but maybe you'll see her again in the afterlife (sorry if you're not, I'm just saying, not trying to offend you). :) [end]
[start] It's...nice, but I feel choked up.   Finding a hidden memento of a lost loved one must be especially tough.   Hang in there. What she'd want you to do. [end]
[start] I just came from that explosion in Boston post and saw that NSFL pic and nothing. I read "sexybutt" and now I'm crying. Sorry for your loss man. I don't know what I would do if someone that close died. [end]
[start] If you need to cry, then cry. I couldn't imagine the amount of mourning you must be going through. I hope you know it's OK to do so. And hopefully, it'll get easier with time. Thanks for sharing. And hang in there friend. [end]
[start] Much love to you man. [end]
[start] oh man. this just made me so sad to read. Hold on to that post it. I hope everything works out for you. I'm sorry.  [end]
[start] This hit me where I live. [end]
[start] hang in there, man. [end]
[start] I feel sad for you, but also, Wow. What a wonderful thing to get one more note from her. I'm so happy for you to get that again. She clearly loved you so much... You can still feel it. [end]
[start] Man, I teared up reading that. Stick in man, it's a devastating thing to have to go through, must be nice to find a reminder of what a fun and loving women she was. Much love [end]
[start] Im glad you smiled. Hope you smile again for her.  [end]
[start] Hard to even know what to say to you, OP. Stay strong, hang in there? I would just be thankful for the moment you smiled, and knowing you had someone who could do that for you, even after her death.  Best wishes. [end]
[start] my hearts with you  [end]
[start] This is tearing me up I want to cry. I'm so sorry for your loss man I can't even begin to imagine how you feel.  [end]
[start] I can't even imagine what you are going through, my friend. I hope I never feel what you are going through now, but I would give anything to experience the sort of love that the two of you seem to have shared. Even for the briefest of moments.  [end]
[start] As much as my wife and I fight I can't imagine life without her.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  My heart goes out to you. [end]
[start] I would cry until the end of time. Bless you & stay as strong as you can...I start to cry just thinking about this.   [end]
[start] To be fair I would have cried louder than a 18 wheeler [end]
[start] I'm sorry for your loss. Be strong and know that she loved you very much.  [end]
[start] Sorry for your loss....hang in there man [end]
[start] Hi. Lost the love of my life 9 months ago. Still getting over that also. Big hug.  “Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.”  ― Dr. Seuss [end]

[TITLE] Tomorrow is the most important day in American history. Half of Trump's inner circle have been convicted of colluding with Russia. Republicans are preventing further investigation. A vote tomorrow for a Republican is a vote for Russia and against America as a democracy [TITLE]
[start] This comment section is going just about as well as I'd expect it to, lol. [end]
[start] *sort by controversial*  [end]
[start] I don’t think it’s the most important day in America’s history, that seems to be a bit extreme.  [end]
[start] Tomorrow is not the most important day in American history. [end]
[start] How did this make the front page?  Seriously.  The most important day in American history?  Christ. [end]
[start] Just to clarify; America is a Republic.  [end]
[start] No it isn't. It's important, but there are way more important days in American History. Moon landing, end of the civil war, emancipation proclamation, Black Civil rights, etc are all way more important in American History. Don't use words that clearly are untrue to make your post sound more meaningful. [end]
[start] OP is what happens when you get all of your political opinions from the front page of Reddit.  [end]
[start] I can’t imagine you’re being a little bit over dramatic  [end]
[start] OP blatantly lied. Half of trumps inner circle have not been convicted of colluding with Russia.   Somehow this is on the front  [end]
[start] Haha. Now this is political humor!   [end]
[start] No it's not [end]
[start] Or, it’s just another election and we can all vote how we want. You know, like a democracy... [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Lmao.. nothing op stated is factual or true.. op is an idiot. [end]
[start] This is not true [end]
[start] Enjoy the civil war you keep stoking. [end]
[start] Actually, the reason (the /logical/) reason that Russia would interfere with the election is to have America divide itself. So, by that logic, you are helping them as much as anyone voting for Trump. The point wasn't to use Trump for some nefarious deeds, it was to divide the people. And you will probably not get along with someone who voted for Trump. Mission accomplished. Divide and conquer.  If you can't defeat an enemy with pure physical strength, you have to beat them with psychology. Make them afraid, or disorganized, or divide them amongst themselves. It's why you lost the war with I think Vietnam. They couldn't beat your army, so they tried to get in the heads of the Americans. They did, they lowered moral significantly. And then the civilians against the government.   If Russia wants to be able to beat America it has to actually push a collapse to happen. And they are. Because people like you.  Read the Art of War.  [end]
[start] Imagine still falling for cold war propaganda  [end]
[start] How can you possible say "the most important" when there have clearly been more important days in American history. Slavery abolishment, 9/11, JFK assassination, are but a few days that seem more important than a day that is hard to weigh it's importance, since it hasn't even happened yet. [end]
[start] Im democratic leaning and i disagree with this message 👎🏻 [end]
[start] Lol [end]
[start] I’m having waayyy to much fun reading these comments.  [end]
[start] This NPC is jokes ha rosane is his news  [end]
[start] It’s nice to see some republican comments in this section! OP, tomorrow is important, but definitely not the most important day in History.  [end]
[start] Ok Alex Jones of the left.  Conspiracy much? Hahaha [end]
[start] Sith always deal in ultimatums.  [end]
[start] Yeah okay the Democrats aren’t super heroes coming to save the day. I’ll vote for whoever I want. Hogan is a damn good governor for my state, and I wouldn’t have s problem with Trone in Congress. Don’t generalize republicans that shit is old. [end]
[start] Voting party lines is fucking retarded. Telling people not to vote for someone because of their party line is fucking retarded.  Do your homework, and vote for the people and issues that matter to you. [end]
[start] This takes extreme to a new extreme lol [end]
[start] Jesus the amount of shit in r/all saying vote democratic is ridiculous. You would think after 2 years of this shit people would realize they’re just circle jerking   [end]
[start] Trump is an idiot but if you think tomorrow is the most important day in American history you're fucking deluded dude. [end]
[start] Wait who was convicted of colluding with Russia?  [end]
[start] Who's a good bot! You're a good bot :) [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Stop talking in superlatives and take a chill pill.  I’m sure that tomorrow is more important than Independence Day, Pearl Harbor, D-Day, 9/11, and Kennedy’s assassination combined, but you don’t need to spill your kool-aid over it.  Also a vote for a Republican is a vote for Russia? Fuck that noise. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Half have been convicted of colluding with Russia? Lol. Go check your facts kid and quit listening to mainstream news.  [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Stop stressing and move to Canada  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] People still believe this shit? [end]
[start] If you believe this your not reading enough.  [end]
[start] I wasn't sure who to vote for until a Russian meme told me Trump. Then Taylor swift told me democratic. Then Leo also told me democratic. Just kidding I think for myself  [end]
[start] It's 2018 close to 2019 and you're still beating this dead horse. Wow.... Stop with the bullshit propaganda and fear mongering, you aren't helping your cause one bit, you only make people think and look at you as crazy, if that's what you want then congratulations, mission is successful! [end]
[start] Vote for Russia?! LMAO. Wow. Ooookay there! Time to out your time foil hat back on and take your meds. [end]
[start] Trump has truly made the left lose their minds [end]
[start] Russia is winning here, or worse may have already won.   Before 2015/16 I didn't vote on party lines. If a candidate supported a cause I care about (and their voting history showed the same) I would vote for them. -The letters were meaningless outside of a generalized way to guess what people might be for or against. Now, such a massively good job has been done on dividing the country that 99% of the people are just going to vote based on the party of the candidates because "Republicans are racist, sexist, and corporatist!" or "Democrats are naive, baby killing communists!"  I really wish people would just fucking stop and look around for a second. We are are Americans, albeit with different views and goals. We should be united as a country, having civil conversations and debates on important topics like abortion, gay marriage, immigration, and poverty. We should **NOT** be terrorizing fellow citizens because they have different views.   (Side note, everything in this paragraph applies to the world stage as well, but let's take it one step at a time and focus on the US first.)  If people would just stop getting all of their news from single biased sources, **especially** Reddit or Facebook, it would be a huge first step in the right direction. The evidence is out there and easily obtainable if people would just look for it. Who benefits from a divided west? Who had their claws in the 2016 election? Who influenced the brexit decision? I hate to paint an entire country as the 'bad guys' when the common citizen there is no more guilty than the common US citizen in a lot of our fucked up decisions being made. The point is, there is a lot of behind the scenes shit going on right now, and the people that are pulling the strings very obviously do not have the general welfare of the human race in mind. [end]

[start] I wasn’t aware anyone’s been convicted of anything to do with Russia I thought they all got convicted of tax fraud from the 80’s which if anyone bothered to look into pelosi or any dem oligarchs it’d be the same. [end]

[start] Nah, not really  [end]
[start] I'm still looking for someone to convince me how Russia affected anything [end]

[start] Why is Reddit so liberal and anti-trump? Would Hillary have been better? Seems like Trump needs a filter but is otherwise effective. [end]

[start] The most important day in American history? I can’t even begin to imagine how delusional somebody has to be to think that this is the most important event in our history.  And no, half of trumps inner circle hasn’t been convicted of colluding with Russia. That’s bullshit.  In fact, if it was so obvious that trump was colluding with Russia, he would have been impeached already. Instead the FBI is pushing obstruction of justice because they don’t have enough evidence.  People like you who are constantly fear-mongering and saying half the country is anti-America is what’s wrong with this country.   Consider this, it’ll be anti-democracy if you oppose a republican victory. The stupidity in this post pisses me off. Things like this are exactly why trump won. The left is pushing nothing but propaganda and Identity politics. Trump would have never gotten elected if the democrats moderated and didn’t shove up Hillary Clinton. [end]
[start] Dumbest shit I’ve read all day. Some Libs are so uneducated like this retard.  [end]
[start] Bullshit.  [end]
[start] Wow such a lunatic bunch of huey [end]
[start] KEK [end]
[start] Bullshit, there has been no russian collusion. What you smoking? [end]
[start] I'm not normally one for "avoid an entire political party" but in this case the Republican party embraced a manbaby who can't speak in coherent sentences and even the more "moderate" Republicans in Congress failed to push back against some of his most questionable, disturbing choices.    So yeah, I agree.  Until Republicans grow a fucking spine and insist on leaders who can speak coherently, fuck their party and fuck their President and his buddies.  [end]
[start] LMAO chill....  [end]
[start] What a bunch of BS [end]
[start] Nah.  [end]
[start] Which half of his inner circle  were convicted? [end]
[start] Every election we hear “this is the most important for the future of our country”...and it never is. No matter who is in charge, you’ll still be and do the same things u did before. Just think both parties have been in power evenly pretty much yet we are still here with the same old shit.  [end]
[start] Love how liberal reddit is [end]
[start] How do i downvote twice [end]

[start] Trump hasnt done anything bad yet.   [end]
[start] What is a vote for democrats?  Do they even have a platform?  All I see is a constant media outrage barrage. Im not sure what else your selling me other than outrage.  Most of your focus seems to be on people who aren’t even citizens in an effort to stack the demographics to buy future power.  Why the fuck would I vote for that? [end]
[start] Trump Derangement Syndrome at it's finest, calm down buddy, it's just the midterms [end]
[start] There's an informed opinion. [end]

[start] Fake news. Jedi Trump may the power be with him. [end]
[start] Further investigations after 2 years of no evidence of trump colluding with Russia? You are completely insane.  Get a grip.  Trump didn't collude, clearly.  The goal of russia was to sow division in America, and you are doing a great job of it!  Honestly, is there any scrap of logic left in your head? Russia loves people like you, useful idiots.   Ps, i bet the Russians bugged your house.  [end]
[start] https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/24/stop-donald-trump-10-reasons-vote-democrats-asap-midterm-elections-column/1733264002/  10 Reasons to Vote for Democrats instead of Republicans  1. Affordable Care Act repealed.  Trump likes to remind his rally crowds that just one vote kept the GOP from fully repealing Obamacare. The man who cast that vote is now dead. If Republicans hold the House, they will certainly gain seats in the Senate. And if this happens, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he’ll begin repeal again, of course.  2. The return of discrimination against Americans with pre-existing conditions.  Republicans have already undermined the ACA’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. But every proposal to replace Obamacare would make this worse by allowing states to help insurers gouge sick people, limit benefits or lock people out of the market for 6 months at a time. Cancer patients will be left to die and Republicans will just keep pretending that they're not bringing back the cruelest feature of America's health care system.  3. The end of Medicaid as we know it.  When Republicans celebrated the passage House Trumpcare bill on the White House lawn, which would have uninsured 23 million Americans, they were also celebrating a slash to Medicaid so massive that it would hardly be fair to call it Medicaid anymore. These cuts would have a “devastating impact on health care for over 70 million people who rely on Medicaid, including over 30 million children and millions of seniors, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and low-income adults,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found.  4. Cuts for Medicare and Social Security.  Don’t believe the GOP will cut America’s most popular earned benefits? Ask the GOP. After giving almost two trillion dollars in tax cuts mostly to the rich and their corporations, Mitch McConnell has said we need to go after “the real drivers of the debt,” which to him are Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid. The House GOP Budget promises cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Trump has promised he won’t cut Medicare. But he has already proposed huge cuts to Social Security and Medicaid, both of which he has promised to protect. Didn't stop him then and won’t stop him when he has a chance to live out more Republican fantasy.  5. Planned Parenthood “defunded.”  If Republicans have 50 Senate votes to deny federal funding to America’s largest single provider of reproductive care to women, the pressure from the right to do it will be irresistible.  6. The death of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Wall Street regulation.  Republicans will gut or get rid of the only new agency set up to prevent another Great Recession, one that has already saved consumers more than $12 billion. And Republicans will keep erasing the few regulations put in place after the 2007-2008 crisis. “A financial market deregulated is like a zoo without bars,” investor Henry Kaufmann said. So yes, it's already time to start worrying about the next financial crisis.   7. More money funneled from real needs to persecuting immigrants.  As pressure to cut a skyrocketing deficit mounts along with the cost of even more tax cuts, Trump’s lust to divert resources to focus on non-criminal immigrants will demand real cuts to real disaster and emergency health needs to pay for a wall and other symbolic affronts we don’t need.  8. Even less oversight.  Forget about finally getting a hearing into the nearly 3,000 Americans left to die after Maria, even the pettiest offenses will be ignored. “For every dollar Congress invests in agency inspectors general, their offices recover $17 in costs savings from their investigations into government fraud, waste and abuse,” Jory Heckman of the Federal News Network reports. The Trump Administration want to slash funding to the little oversight that’s happening in the government as it transforms the courts into the shape of giant rubber stamp.  **9. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation ended or gutted — and pardons for the whole Trump campaign.**  If the GOP wins the House, expect this to happen before Speaker Paul Ryan departs to begin his career as a lobbyist. (Warning: This will probably happen even if the GOP loses the House.)  **10. Countless horrors we cannot imagine.**  But let's try. Say there's a Senate with 50 post-midterm votes for anything Trump says he wants, and a House run by the conservatives who engineered the assault on the FBI’s Russia investigation. The damage this Congress could do would be incalculable — from voting rights, public education, American diplomacy and the civil service, to treaties and trade agreements, the environment and the rights of LGBT Americans.   If we get a Democratic House, Trump will never accept its legitimacy and will blame Democrats for every problem in the world, as he does already. But it will be worth it for the subpoena power and the hope that our government can begin to work as the Constitution intended.  But first you have to vote, as soon as you can. [end]

[start] I'll vote for whoever I want, thank you. [end]
[start] Good ol Trump.  Draining the swamp, by building a tower on it and leasing it to Comcast, Verizon, Equifax, EA, and Russia. [end]
[start] America is a Republic. Red wave  [end]
[start] America is a republic, not a democracy... [end]
[start] Yikes, I wish i could believe this was a satirical post, because if it was, it'd be amazing. [end]
[start] Lol, good luck with your propaganda  [end]
[start] Dont vote for partys, vote for people.  [end]
[start] McCarthyism is back, baby. [end]
[start] Not true. A vote for republicans is a vote agaonst radicalism and greenlighting [end]
[start] That’s a joke, right?   a VOtE fOr DEmOcraT IS a VotE fOr SoCIaLIsM [end]
[start] Democracy? We're a Constitutional Republic, ran by the rich minority. [end]
[start] Take your tinfoil hat off OP. Reddit is such a biased liberal hugbox, it's disgusting. [end]
[start] Fucking obnoxious. This is so dramatic  [end]
[start] Well comrads I guess I'm voting for Russia then  [end]
[start] If you're gonna bash an entire group of people just because they lean one way or another, you're instantly marked as an idiot in my books. Most people are moderate, but tend to lean one way or another. Labeling an entire group of people because there's a few crazy's in it is just wrong.   This goes for both liberals and conservatives. It's the crazy people that make the majority of us look bad.  [end]
[start] First thread to bring a bit of faith back in reddit that were not all copy paste idiots  Haven't seen this much critical thought in a long time on the front page in a politics post. [end]
[start] Saving this post because holy shit OP is delusional. [end]
[start] Hillary lost  Try again in 2020, until then get a fucking life. [end]
[start] If Republicans were against democracy I’d vote for them. [end]
[start] this is fucking stupid [end]
[start] This is a unfair claim to make. [end]
[start] I’m gonna vote Republican I’m thinking [end]
[start] This argument is flawed. Its like when people say “A vote for abortion is a vote for killing children!” Not I just think a woman has the right to do what they want with their body... I’m not voting for Russia I’m just voting for I think is a better lead of a nation!  [end]
[start] Don't cry too hard when we ( the republicans) win tomorrow!  [end]
[start] Well said. I am voting blue.   [end]
[start] I’m not tired of winning yet. Vote red if you want the country to continue to be successful economically and in general like it has over the past 2 years. Vote blue if you don’t. Simple... Sure, we have some stuff to remedy, but less so than if the dems take power.  [end]
[start] I disagree. We should not be voting based on party. Some Republicans are moderates who, frankly, reach across the aisle far more than some Democrats. Take the late former US Senator John McCain, for example. Although I disagreed quite a bit with his views, his status as a moderate would make me pick him over any extremely liberal candidate who wasn't open to any sort of bipartisanship. [end]
[start] maybe if you smoke crack OP [end]
[start] A vote for Democrat is against America and our republic. Vote red tomorrow to stop the invasion of Leftism/Communism. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Good evening fellow NPCs orange man bad  [end]
[start] Well thats a bunch of nonsense. [end]
[start] I disagree. We should not be voting based on party. Some Republicans are moderates who, frankly, reach across the aisle far more than some Democrats.

[start] The last line made me laugh; then it made me sad because I realized you seriously believe yourself. [end]
[start] America isn’t a democracy you dumb nut... all liberals are stupid. [end]
[start] Fucking NPCs. [end]
[start] I think it’s more accurate to say that 0% of Trumps inner circle has been convicted of colluding with Russia.  [end]

[start] No they haven't. While a few have had charges put on them, yes, but not for colliding with Russia. If anything, we now know that the Hillary campaign did more colluding. [end]
[start] Holy shit some Americans are so dumb [end]
[start] "Half of Trumps inner circle have been "convicted" of colluding with Russia" LMFAO at how idiotic that   sentence is!   The Bible refers to us as sheep; I totally get it now!    [end]
[start] It must suck to believe CNN all the time and live in fear. I guess they have done their job on the weak minded.  [end]
[start] This post was so dumb that it inspired me to go out and vote republican [end]
[start] Fake news  [end]
[start] By your mentality I offer this counterpoint.  Tomorrow is **NOT** the "most important day in American history", but it is an opportunity to send the Democrats a message that we, as Conservatives and as Americans, do not stand for the attempted dismantling of Due Process in favor of Mob Rule with Brett Kavanaugh.  We do not support the open calls for action (Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton) against Republicans, and do not support your Complacency with violence against your political opponents (Bernie Sanders supporter shooting the GOP baseball game, Obama supporter shooting Dallas Police Officers, Antifa burning DC, as well as attacking citizens in Portland, BLM burning down Furgeson over a Justified Shooting, several flash mobs screaming and engaging Republicans and their families and children at restaurants, the shooting of Jews in a synagogue, etc.).   That we do not desire to grant you power after your constant personal attacks on our beliefs, or accusations of us being Nazis and Demons simply for voting differently than you.  That we do not support the two year Russian investigation that has wasted millions of dollars of taxpayers money in exchange for indictments on 11 Russian Facebook users with no relationship to Trump whatsoever.  That we're tired of 92% of all press coverage attacking our beliefs and way of life, simply to brainwash their viewers and push a narrative.  That we do not support illegal immigration and acknowledge that we are not a nation without our borders, and if you can't migrate legally, you shouldn't migrate at all.  That we do not support the constant interference in Congress and constant protests and riots that have caused billions of dollars of damage over the last two years, riots the left has Celebrated.  That we do not support your Socialist ideology, an ideology that has killed millions of people throughout history and has never worked, even in the slightest anywhere it's been implemented.  That we do not support your hatred for Israel, or your hatred of anyone who doesn't think, look, or act like you.  That we do not support your constant calls for legislation against the Constitution, and total disregard for our nation's history.  That we do not support your corrupt and criminal candidates, or your selective hatred against accused criminals of the right, but not the left (Kavanaugh raped nobody yet was ruined, Cory Booker molested a girl and was considered a hero).  This is a vote to tell the Democrats that violence, incivility, and rage are not acceptable in this nation, and that fighting a system with violence and incivility simply for not agreeing with it is **not** a way to regain power.   The Democrats have done nothing to deserve your vote, and deserve no power.  They simply attack your way of life, and attack your way of thinking.  Remember this at the polls tomorrow.  The truth is power. [end]
[start] There won't be a blue wave, just a blue flush.. [end]
[start] This post is making me rethink how I was going to vote tomorrow...  ...because I don't like the idea of agreeing with someone this stupid. [end]
[start] #nevervotedem  [end]
[start] Seeing posts like this just push people (myself included) further onto the trump train. Stop dictating how people should exercise their right to vote and let people make their own damn minds up [end]
[start] Very inaccurate, but when has that ever stopped Reddit before? [end]
[start] We have been hearing from the Dems that "this election is the most important one ever" for every election going back at least 40 years. It gets old and tiring. The sky isn't falling Chicken Little, relax. You are being manipulated and used by older people who should know better but dom't care. This emotive, reactionary left helps noone. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] OP, go home. Tomorrow is a big day, nowhere near the most important day in US history. Such statements are farcically inaccurate and serve to only make people nervous.  [end]
[start] Lol a bit worried Reddit that your corrupt party will lose again? [end]
[start] The most important day will come when we will learn to love one another and come together as one. [end]
[start] Don't know much about your own history then I see, big suprise.  [end]
[start] False  [end]
[start] This truly belongs on the unpopular opinions subreddit.  [end]
[start] It really isn't that important [end]
[start] OP is probably a Russian bot attempting to divde us, just look how he spams his fake Russian propaganda. Reported. [end]
[start] What an idiot [end]
[start] A vote is a vote. It is YOUR voice in a democracy. Use it as you see fit, and respect your fellow people, win or lose. This "left bad, right bad" bullshit is dividing America, the way all of America's enemies want to divide us. [end]
[start] What a load of crap.   You speak as, after 2 years, they have found evidence of collusion.    They have produced nothing and you know if.   That’s why all Dems run on is fear mongering  [end]
[start] By god you’re a dumb mongoloid [end]
[start] as usual, russian trolls are all over this post.  [end]
[start] Im canadian and even i know usa is not a democracy its a republic [end]
[start] I guess this subreddit is a bunch of D’s lol. Well, keep downvoting here so the R’s win tomorrow 😂. [end]
[start] OP you’re a fucking clown [end]
[start] More bullshit hyperbole.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] \>	be reddit user  \>	partake in democracy and vote for a conservative because the debt racked up by the country is kinda big  \>   get called a Russian shill that hates democracy  \>	*¿ ¿ ¿ wat? ? ?* [end]
[start] "convicted of colluding with Russia"....TDS at its finest!! If you want Trump re-elected then by all means keep posting this drivel. [end]
[start] Oh jeez what an overdramatic post. It's this, as well as all the crap on the other end, that has completely driven me away from politics. Never again. [end]
[start] Where are you facts, OP?  [end]
[start] “Vote for republican is a vote for Russia”  Lol   [end]
[start] Haha let's just ignore uranium1, Hillary's emails, government hard drives, fusionGPS, apology tours to russia, etc etc so dont accuse every Republican alive of being pro Russia  [end]
[start] This is the dumbest post that has ever existed in the history of reddit. Not one person has been convicted of colluding. Republicans are the ones leading the congressional investigations and no one has tried to step in the way of Mueller. A vote for a Republican is a vote for actual citizens of this country. America is a constitutional republic. Not a democracy. This POC definitely has the latest firmware. [end]
[start] No matter who you vote for, just go vote. But seriously, vote blue please and let’s get this asshole pushed towards getting removed from office and held accountable for whatever he’s hiding.  [end]
[start] Voting republican means voting Russian?   I think thats a little over the top.   That being said, the republic candidate in my state is an idiot and I will not vote for her for this reason.  [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] That’s funny, I’ve only seen Russian connections with the DNC  [end]
[start] lol wow ignorant [end]
[start] most people voting republican could give two shits about democracy. they’ve already bought into the cult of personality that creates caesars.  [end]
[TITLE] I’ve been a drug addict for most of my adult life (33) got clean from dope when I was 26 and always lived paycheck to paycheck. For the first time ever I have 5k in my bank account. I’ve never had over 1k ever in my life. I feel rich. I feel happy and stress free. [TITLE]
[start] A nest egg/emergency fund is a great thing to have.  *And this is only the beginning...* [end]
[start] Hey bro. That’s so amazing.   I’m 34, around 5 years removed from opiates.  I understand how different it is to be in the position you’re in.  Keep doing it [end]
[start] I’m 26 and I’ve been clean for a few years, but I basically never have a comma in my bank account balance. Don’t really know what career path I want to take, that’s what I’m struggling with right now. [end]
[start] I remember when I stopped using drugs. stopped not quit. keep that in mind I'm not claiming I'm sober. I married, saving for a house, new job in a new city so not interest in drugs really just faded over a few months  anyway I remember crossing the 1000k threshold. by that I mean I had paid off all my Bill's and still had 1000k left over. then passing 5 and 10 and then buying a house, starting over at near 0 and getting back. I never got as much saved up as I did before I bought the house, but I mean, I have a house, 2 cars and a baby, like I dont have to pay rent ever again and after february I'll have no car payments  this feeling is better than any high because there is no comedown or withdrawal or cravings it is permanent [end]
[start] My ex was my drug.  Also used to live paycheck to paycheck.    Over drafted every single month.  Kept telling her "we need to stop spending money.  We can't afford it right now." But she'd always have something "but I need this!" Or "I really want this" and naive me kept giving into her whatever she wanted because I felt like it was my duty to take care of her.  Whatever she needed or whatever she wanted.  (Little side note, in the last couple years of our marriage, it actually was drugs she always ended up buying which got progressively worse as time went on.  And I was then only one working this entire relationship)  Finally got the evidence that while she kept using my money for whatever she wanted, she also decided to start having an affair with another guy that also doesn't work!  I wouldn't do drugs with her to make sure I could pass any random drug tests that might've come my way to make sure I could keep supporting my family, so she found somebody she could spend all her time doing drugs with!    Now that she's gone, I'm now able to keep a steady supply of income in my bank account plus have a hearty savings account to back me up and on top of it all, I'm still managing to spoil my daughter!  Awfully great how this all worked out. [end]
[start] Proud stranger here.. Congratulations! That’s a worthy and difficult achievement in ways that only you could know. Keep at it, you’ve made it but you’re still on your way. The view is always better towards the top! [end]
[start] Proud of you, stranger!!! I currently have $79 in my savings account LOL [end]
[start] What do you do for a living? [end]
[start] Here's to the up and up, never stop climbing! [end]
[start] Congratulations!! [end]
[start] YESSS GET ITTTTT. Sending you wishes of accumulating even more wealth and success. [end]
[start] ....and being able to trust yourself with money in the bank -- priceless. That's the best part. Good job! [end]
[start] You will always feel Rich and stress free if you keep your bills low and stay away from anything you want to buy on a payment plan. Trust me it’s not worth it. I live with as little as possible but I am comfortable and so happy. [end]
[start] Kudos to you. Hope you realise that you have more in the bank than the 5k.  Also that your post will be read by many and your efforts will be inspiring.  Keep in keeping on. [end]
[start] I'm really happy for you [end]
[start] Brilliant.  How awesome must you feel and thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] Soooo happy for you! Look what you did! Rock on!!! [end]
[start] That’s great man. Good luck with everything [end]
[start] Congrats [end]
[start] Great job man,keep up the good work [end]
[start] This is awesome. One day at a time! Congrats man [end]
[start] You are awesome! [end]
[start] I'm glad you overcame this. I really hope life will keep getting better and better. Don't let that happiness go too far away, cause you already know it was hard to find it through all those issues. Take care. [end]
[start] Happy days friend, glad ur getting things straightened out and have a nest egg now!!!! [end]
[start] Congratulations, brother!   Keep lookin' up, and keep cliiiimbin' the mountain, yeah!  Sky's the limit and space is the place! Dig it! [end]
[start] Keep moving! Congrats! [end]
[start] Coming from someone in a mirror-like situation, that's huge! Good on you! [end]
[start] Congratulations for getting sober!!! I know from watching my parents struggle that it’s a hard road to sobriety. I hope more good things come your way :) [end]
[start] Congrats dude! [end]
[start] Amazing, congrats [end]
[start] Wooo! Congratulations! I'm looking forward to celebrating my 1 year of sobriety on January 7th. You're awesome! [end]
[start] Congrats on your savings and sobriety. As someone who is divorced from an addict around your age, I can see it's not an easy thing to do. Can I suggest that now you're in a good place, you take steps to try and ensure your life stays this course. So, have a plan, people, resources should life get hard and you're tempted to use again. My marriage has just ended and I am now fighting to keep our young daughter safe from her own father who has turned from a wonderful man into a physically, emotionally and verbally abusive person I no longer recognise. I am beyond devastated for our daughter, and gutted myself. He has thrown his life away for drugs and it's horrendous for everyone who cares about him to watch. I fear one day he will realize what he's done here and be suicidal as a result. We had a great life, but difficulties with his family became too much and he resorted to drugs to cope. Congrats again, I'm sure it wasn't an easy road. [end]
[start] Well done [end]
[start] What kind of dope? [end]
[start] Glad for you mate, keep it that way. [end]
[start] Saying well done to this massive lifestyle change seems very very inadequate but I hope you are seriously proud of being able to turn around a huge part do your life. I can't even imagine how she'd that was to do. [end]
[start] Well done friend! [end]
[start] Congrats on your sobriety. [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing your story. It’s great that you’ve overcome such hardship and aren’t just surviving... your thriving.  These sort of stories need to be shared. There are many still stuck that believe it is impossible. Your story will encourage them. [end]
[start] That’s amazing! Keep up the great work!! Proud of you ❤️ [end]
[start] I'm super stoked for you bro! [end]
[start] I'm proud of you 😊 [end]
[start] So proud of you brotha. I really really am. The comfort feeling is always gonna bea better feeling then getting high I promise ya. [end]
[start] Good for you !!! [end]
[start] Nice to see more people taking their lives into their hands.   Just tip from self, dont sacrife your mental health of denying yourself small joys by saving every penny, but once again cant have enough savings :D  Never been addicted to substances apart from alcohol binge here and there, but was just coasting in life. Parents uprooted me when i was 11 to move to another country and when i was almost 18 they decided to repatriate. I moved to another country which language ive somewhat learnt at school and spent my time "squatting/couch surfing/etc" taking random jobs. At almost 28 something hit me, all those advices ive read on reddit.  Enrolled to trade school as an electrician. With confidence lied on my CVs (had the hand skills to handle tools like a pro from life experiences) 5years later employ 2 people, pay them 30% more than market average and still end up in 5% of top earners. [end]
[start] I’m just here to tell you that I’m proud of you. Keep your head up and stick to daily program. Everyday you have to go to war with that little voice of self doubt in your head and I congratulate you for winning the battles.   Give em hell. [end]
[start] I feel so happy for you. Hold on to this feeling keep it safe. One day if things don't feel very hopeful, come back to this feeling, knowing that you've done it before and you'll do it again. Happy savings [end]
[start] That's awesome man, keep it up! [end]
[start] That's so huge and amazing. My sister is experiencing the same thing these days (clean and sober with money in the bank) and I'm so proud of her and happy to see more and more people getting clean and living better lives. [end]
[start] Omg congrats!!! You should be so proud of yourself. I'm also an addict & I'm about 45 days since my last use. I'm on methadone though.  Anyway one of the things I'm most looking forward to is getting my finances back in order. I just opened a high yield savings account with discover. Definitely worth looking into if you haven't already.  I wish you all the best!!! [end]
[start] Amazing! Well done you have come so far! [end]
[start] CONGRATULATIONS!!! From one Sober person to another I know the struggle and never stop remembering or reminding yourself how powerful you are and if you can beat the obstacles you already have that nothing can get in your way!! I know I dont know you but I am proud of you!! [end]
[start] Although I do not know you, I am so proud of you. My prayer for you is continued success and a life filled with love and happiness. [end]
[start] It can get a lot better, the longer you're clean. Look forward to the future! [end]
[start] Hope you are doing fine ma man! Happy to see you smiling, hope better days will come in your path my friend.   Stay safe and may god bless you :) [end]
[start] I wish I could relate [end]
[start] congrats man, while i have never gone through this, its good to see you got clean and are staying clean, keep it up, and dont quit, well done, sincerely [end]
[start] Keep going! [end]
[start] Great job!!!   You should be so proud of yourself! [end]
[start] Feels good huh? Welcome to the party. Wouldn't it be something if we (addicts) became a group of powerful (money-wise) individuals that, beyond all belief, came to be a ruling class? Goals my friend. Goals. [end]
[start] I'm so proud of you being so many years sober! I bet it's a struggle but showing that you have done it this long shows a lot. Congrats on pushing forward and taking step by step. Sometimes that's all that takes to get to a place that's amazing  :D [end]
[start] Good for you man! That is a big accomplishment, keep up the good work! [end]
[start] Congrats. I'm so happy for you. [end]
[start] Proud of you for staying clean and saving money! [end]
[start] It's called income tax and yes it's a great thing lol [end]
[start] Works if u work it [end]
[start] You are rich. Your sober. Keep up the good work [end]
[start] You feel rich and happy because you are in control of your life, as an adult. Congratulations. Be the boss. [end]
[start] Nice, i'm still in limbo of what i want from life, even when dope screams at me in my head, posts like this help me stick my head out and breathe for a  second in this jello like world. I want to be like you one day.   Congrats and Kudos 💖 [end]
[start] You’re awesome! [end]
[start] Amazing. Keep on being the best you. [end]
[start] Congratulations! [end]
[start] omg!! that’s so great for you, it must be so liberating!! congrats! [end]
[start] Great job. I've had a similar experience. Currently working on my stack. Your victory made my day [end]
[start] I was in the low 1000s for most of my 20s. Once you get that drive and you hit 5000, push to 10000, then to 50000. You can do anything when you have discipline and motivation. [end]
[start] Awesome yo congratulations [end]

[start] I’m happy to hear this ! You have earned your happiness, and it’s great to know you’re healing from addiction. [end]
[start] That’s awesome! I always love hearing rare success stories like yours. There is a lot of hope out there, and making small changes over a period of time is remarkably effective. I wish you the best and this internet stranger is proud of you! [end]
[start] Keep going bro! This is amazing. [end]
[start] Obviously you are doing something right, keep doing it, good luck [end]
[start] Here I am with $10k feeling like I should be spending less and saving more. Then again, I have $80k worth of debt. [end]
[start] Hey, congrats! Both big accomplishments and you should be proud of yourself! [end]
[start] I can't relate to you, but for some unknown reason, dude, you just made my day. So happy for you. Keep it up, man. Can't even imagine how good you must feel [end]
[start] Good for you dude.   I have never done drugs, am married, have a kid, couple degrees and have less than a grand in the bank. Sigh.   In all seriousness, good for you. Kicking the habit can be brutally hard. Keep it up! [end]
[start] Congrats and keep up the good work!!! 👍🏼👍🏼 [end]
[start] Woooo! Way to believe in yourself! [end]
[start] That's amazing to hear about your sobriety dear keep it uo! [end]
[start] Good shit man. From one addict in recovery to another. You’re the fucking man. Stay strong n keep up the good fight man. [end]
[start] Give this man/woman a round of applause! [end]
[start] You deserve the happiness and joy you feel. Your worthy and I am proud of you. Sending the best sober vibes and hugs 09/25/09 [end]
[start] Thanks! I remember the 1st week I thought my life was just over, I'm never going to have fun or enjoy anything without drugs, I won't be able to enjoy holidays or family time. In reality I was so high I don't remember any of it. I'm glad I stuck it out because I actually have a life now and am not just worried about my next fix. [end]
[start] Prob the wrong post to ask but my brother just knocked up his herion addicted girlfriend.  My family is having a hard time even looking at her anymore because of all the stealing nasty things shes done and said on top of cheating on my brother all that.  My question is, do you think all of those things could have been caused by the drugs? Im have a very hard time believing that she didnt mean any of that stuff but i also never asked a formor addict before either. [end]
[start] Dude imagine your washer breaking! No biggie! Good job dude! [end]
[start] This is great. Very good job. Make $5,000 be $6,000 next. You've got this. [end]
[start] Congrats man!  I don't know what exactly tripped in me, but ever since a young age, I've kept my money.  I feel secure having it.  More money = less stress.   Congrats on the savings. [end]
[start] Congratulations!! [end]
[start] Now buy a shit load of heroin and flip it. [end]
[start] I lost my wife to addiction in 2014. Our kids were 11 and 13 at that time. I have worked very hard to make sure my kids are okay. I put them both in therapy immediately after it happened. My daughter has flourished. She earned herself a scholarship to Notre Dame. But my son was a Momma’s boy. And he struggled. To be honest, he still does. I don’t think he will ever truly get over it. He is a good kid. But I can see the pain in his eyes. And it kills me. Because I cant help him. Congratulations on getting clean. In a way, I’m envious of you. My wife would get clean, but always ended up messing up again. My kids didn’t deserve to go through that pain. But life isn’t fair. I miss her. I miss her a lot. [end]
[start] go blow the 5k on dope [end]
[start] Congrats! That’s a great accomplishment!  You deserve a sober life!!! [end]
[start] If you want to move to Ottawa Canada, and work in the outdoors, I will give you a really cool job. [end]
[start] I'm 32 and got clean around the same time, but I can't save a damn penny. How did you do it? Any advice or direction would be hugely appreciated. [end]
[start] Awesome for you! I know that feeling too. I have been so broke where I had to sleep on a couch for a while. God it was a pain. No, I wasn't homeless for more than a year but shit got better. I've never done any drug other than maybe weed but even then, I barely need anything. Give me a coke, I'm fine then.      But glad you feel good about yourself! [end]
[start] This is awesome. Dont stop. [end]
[start] Very proud of you, be proud of yourself as well! [end]
[start] I find these experiences always nice to hear, but I have never been in such a position. I have had my own battles, but not like yours. My question is: how did you do it? It's pretty personal. But it seems like you got your shit together which is impressive maby you have tips for others [end]
[start]  What motivated you to stay clean?? [end]
[start] ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  4 years clean here, isn’t it insane to actually have money in your account and wallet instead of struggling to scrounge up $10. Proud of you, go treat yo’self good [end]
[start] Keep on going my fren! [end]
[start] The same amount of upvotes your post has at this time [end]

[start] Wishing you a beautiful Christmas to enjoy the simple things! [end]
[start] You will hedonically adapt to that state so you will want more, then you will hit the limit and fall again into having less money, the same way economical cycles exist. Finally you will realize life is a trap of constant unbalances. [end]
[start] That’s buy a lot of yayo [end]
[start] I question "paycheck to Paycheck" people all the time, "How do you not see the real value in just having enough money to cover emergencies?"   It would be worth it to spend the money to get that peace of mind, but you don't have to spend money to get it. You just have to have some discipline and save it. [end]

[start] When I graduated I got a summa cum laude award for the highest GPA in my program but didn't know this ahead of time so I learned about it when I walked across the stage and was like "Uh, OK, great, thanks". This then lead to being accepted into grad school (I didn't know that graduating summa cum laude meant it was more likely I would be accepted into grad school...lack of mentorship lol). I didn't crash and burn in my Master's so was accepted into a doctoral program without any difficulty and now work as a professor. You probably don't have a frame of reference for your achievement u/lyberkim but rest assured that this distinction is probably the start to many other successes that will lead to a very interesting life! I love my job and now try to mentor all the talented undergrads and grads I come across. [end]
[start] Hell yeah!!! Congratulations!!! Incredible achievement. [end]
[start] Congratulations on your great achievement 🎉👍👏 It took much hard work and focus.  You need to be proud of your dedication and achievement! Sending hugs electronically.  Best wishes on the wonderful career ahead of you. [end]

[start] Takes a while to post a comment. [end]
[start] Welcome to the new era of crony capitalism! FUCK YOU GOVERNMENT , we saw through your BS. [end]
[start] As the date to comment has been extended till 20th August and we can discuss in some detail, to provide information, I am posting below the original text of the 24 recommendations that DoT Committee had given in May 2005 on Net Neutrality ( AFAIK, Indian citizens are formally talking about these on myGov.in site ). To my lay-eyes they appear compliant with Net Neutrality as understood in international discourse. What am I missing?         1. The Committee unhesitatingly recommends that “the core principles of Net Neutrality must be adhered to.”   2. The international best practices along with core principles of Net Neutrality will help in formulating India specific Net Neutrality approach. India should take a rational approach and initiate action in making an objective policy, specific to the needs of our country. The timing for this is apt, taking into consideration the exponential growth of content and applications on the Internet.   3. Innovation and infrastructure have both to be promoted simultaneously and neither can spread without the other. The endeavor in policy approach should be to identify and eliminate actions that inhibit the innovation abilities inherent in an open Internet or severely inhibit investment in infrastructure.   4. The primary goals of public policy in the context of Net Neutrality should be directed towards achievement of developmental aims of the country by facilitating “Affordable Broadband”, “Quality Broadband” and “Universal Broadband” for its citizens.   5. User rights on the Internet need to be ensured so that TSPs/ISPs do not restrict the ability of the user to send, receive, display, use, post any legal content, application or service on the Internet, or restrict any kind of lawful Internet activity or use.   6. OTT application services have been traditionally available in the market for some time and such services enhance consumer welfare and increase productivity. Therefore, such services should be actively encouraged and any impediments in expansion and growth of OTT application services should be removed.   7. There should be a separation of “application layer” from “network layer” as application services are delivered over a licensed network.   8. Specific OTT communication services dealing with messaging should not be interfered with through regulatory instruments.   9. In case of VoIP OTT communication services, there exists a regulatory arbitrage wherein such services also bypass the existing licensing and regulatory regime creating a non-level playing field between TSPs and OTT providers both competing for the same service provision. Public policy response requires that regulatory arbitrage does not dictate winners and losers in a competitive market for service provision.   10. The existence of a pricing arbitrage in VoIP OTT communication services requires a graduated and calibrated public policy response. In case of OTT VoIP international calling services, a liberal approach may be adopted. However, in case of domestic calls (local and national), communication services by TSPs and OTT communication services may be treated similarly from a regulatory angle for the present. The nature of regulatory similarity, the calibration of regulatory response and its phasing can be appropriately determined after public consultations and TRAI’s recommendations to this effect.   11. For OTT application services, there is no case for prescribing regulatory oversight similar to conventional communication services.   12. Legitimate traffic management practices may be allowed but should be “tested” against the core principles of Net Neutrality. General criteria against which these practices can be tested are as follows:      a) TSPs/ISPs should make adequate disclosures to the users about their traffic management policies, tools and intervention practices to maintain transparency and allow users to make informed choices.      b) Unreasonable traffic management, exploitative or anti-competitive in nature may not be permitted.       c) In general, for legitimate network management, application-agnostic control may be used. However, application-specific control within the “Internet traffic” class may not be permitted.      d) Traffic management practices like DPI should not be used for unlawful access to the type and contents of an application in an IP packet.      e) Improper (Paid or otherwise) Prioritization may not be permitted      f) Application-agnostic congestion control being a legitimate requirement cannot be considered to be against Net Neutrality. However application-specific control within the “Internet traffic” class may be against the principles of Net Neutrality.      g) Mechanism to minimize frivolous complaints will be desirable.   13. Traffic management is complex and specialized field and enough capacity building is needed before undertaking such an exercise.   14. CDN is an arrangement of management of content as a business strategy and does not interfere with others business. Making available one provider’s CDN to others on commercial terms is a normal commercial activity. It should at best be covered under law related to unfair trade practice.   15. Managed services are a necessary requirement for businesses and enterprises, and suitable exceptions may be made for the treatment of such services in the Net Neutrality context.   16. This Committee refrains from making any specific recommendation on search-neutrality, however, flags this issue as a concern for public policy.   17. Tariff plans offered by TSPs/ISPs must conform to the principles of Net Neutrality set forth in guidelines issued by the Government as Licensor. TRAI may examine the tariff filings made by TSPs/ISPs to determine whether the tariff plan conforms to the principles of Net Neutrality.   18. Content and application providers cannot be permitted to act as gatekeepers and use network operations to extract value in violation of core principles of Net Neutrality, even if it is for an ostensible public purpose.   19. A clause, requiring licensee to adhere to the core principles of Net Neutrality, as specified by guidelines issued by the licensor from time to time, should be incorporated in the license conditions of TSP/ISPs. The guidelines can describe the principles and conditions of Net Neutrality in detail and provide applicable criteria to test any violation of the principles of Net Neutrality.   20. New legislation, whenever planned for replacing the existing legal framework, must incorporate principles of Net Neutrality. Till such time as an appropriate legal framework is enacted, interim provisions enforceable through licensing conditions as suggested by the Committee may be the way forward.   21. National security is paramount, regardless of treatment of Net Neutrality. The measures to ensure compliance of security related requirements from OTT service providers, need to be worked out through inter-ministerial consultations.   22. Suggested enforcement process is as follows:      (i) Core principles of Net Neutrality may be made part of License conditions and the Licensor may issue guidelines from time to time as learning process matures.      (ii) Since Net Neutrality related cases would require specialized expertise, a cell in the DoT HQ may be set up to deal with such cases. In case of violations, the existing prescribed procedure may be followed. This would involve two stage process of review and appeal to ensure that decisions are objective, transparent and just.      (iii) Tariff shall be regulated by TRAI as at present. Whenever a new tariff is introduced it should be tested against the principles of Net Neutrality. Post implementation, complaint regarding a tariff violating principle of Net Neutrality may be dealt with by DoT.      (iv) Net Neutrality issues arising out of traffic management would have reporting and auditing requirements, which may be performed and enforced by DoT.      (v) QoS issues fall within the jurisdiction of TRAI. Similarly reporting related to transparency requirements will need to be dealt with by TRAI. TRAI may take steps as deemed fit.   23. Enforcing Net Neutrality principle is a new idea and may throw up many questions and problems as we go along. For this purpose, an oversight process may be set up by the government to advise on policies and processes, review guidelines, reporting and auditing procedures and enforcement of rules.   24. Capacity building through training, institution building and active engagement with stakeholders is essential. In order to deal with the complexities of the new digital world, a think-tank with best talent may also be set up.

[start] Net Neutrality means access to EVERYTHING without discrimination Don't allow telecom operators to change the definition of Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality means access to EVERYTHING on the Internet, without discrimination. Not access to everyone. We want everyone to get access, but to all of the Internet. Don't allow creation of private walled gardens. [end]

[TITLE] Five years ago a guy at the theater stole my phone [TITLE]
[start] Whoa that is kind of weird.  I wonder if there is a name for this sort of thing.  There was a radiolab episode on slightly similar situation.  Complete stranger observing neighbor's life and death through her window.  http://www.radiolab.org/story/living-room/  [end]
[start] Dang, man!   I have a somewhat related story. About 12 years ago, when I was a young teenager, I got really interested in learning how to hack websites.  One day, I wanted to impress my friend so I searched for some site that looked vulnerable and found a personal website that had a "private" section. Said section was only protected by a JavaScript prompt so I found the password in clear text in the source.  Long story short, he used the same password for his FTP account and email account. I dickishly proceeded to change his index.html to a blank page saying "HACKED! I will contact you with details on how to revert back to your old page". I then sent the guy an email from his own account with instructions on how to fix his site and make it more secure.  Now this is where this gets interesting, I must have saved his email address somewhere but I really don't remember doing so. I joined LinkedIn a couple years ago with an email address that I didn't have until my 20s and, somehow, LinkedIn keeps telling me that I should add this guy as a connection. I have no idea how they figured out that I "know" him but I think that's cool. I checked his profile and he is now working in the network security industry so I can't help but feel that I had an influence on this guy's life even though I never had a conversation with him and he lives across the globe.  EDIT: maybe he is still trying to track me down and this post will be his big break haha!  EDIT2: When I got home, I checked my gmail (which I use for linkedin) contacts and he is not in there. He is, however, in my hotmail contacts, which is the account I had at the time. I don't remember how/when he got into my contacts, I searched my inbox and I have no emails to/from him or referencing him. I'm still curious as to how LinkedIn figured out my hotmail contacts from my gmail account... Mystery still partially unsolved...  EDIT3: I just checked his LinkedIn profile and he moved to where I used to live, he's finally coming to get his revenge!! [end]
[start] I can't imagine how you feel. On one hand, it's instinctual to feel that primal rage against someone low enough to steal from another person, while our humanity makes us feel sorry for the guy who felt so lost and alone that he decided to end his life.  [end]
[start] I had a really disturbing experience kind of like this one night when I bore witness to somebody making some pretty serious escalating threats on this random social media website one night last year. Basically live-streaming an absolute mental break.   I tried to report it, but the website was small as social media goes and so it didn't care and didn't want to be in a position to care. The authorities weren't prepared to handle concerns about strangers over the internet and essentially laughed it off. A suicide hotline essentially hung up on me. And I didn't know what to do. I'd never been around serious suicide threats before. It was terrifying. All the while there were these pictures rolling in of open pill bottles in his hand and his weapon collection and on and on. People were saying things like, "can I have your stuff? lol" and "what a waste of good pills." It was pretty crazy. This must be happening all over.   I ended up spending like 12 hours trying to get in touch with anybody that could help. In the end I paid Facebook $1 to contact his family after essentially stalking my way through the entire internet data mining as I went to his family (which was oblivious).   I talked to them afterwards and his brother said in this kind of shellshocked way that he thought it could have gone either way, that he thought there was real danger.   I think we have a very serious culture problem. And we have to do something.   Something needs to be done, but I can't find others that want to talk about it. I tried my best for months to write an entertaining long form piece on that experience (which has been one of the most affecting on a now fairly "travelled" path) in such a way that it might inspire a discussion. But I can't find a place to publish interested enough in the concept enough to even check it out.   I get more worried everyday about the future. If the globe warms, maybe we as one can cool it. If the bombs fly, all the world might stop their flight. If disease spreads, together we will cure it. But if the lattice holding us in configuration to stage the efforts rots to collapse, what will act to build it back? [end]
[start] Man, that's actually quite surreal. I feel compelled to make a short film based on your story. Do you give permission?  [end]
[start] Great story. I believe you but even if it was fabricated, it still illuminates the fact that everyone you cross paths with has an entire life story.   And the technology aspect of it is amazing- turning a fleeting encounter to a voyeuristic saga. Good writing too I actually feel sad as well.   [end]
[start] I can only express my extreme gratitude for your sharing with simple words. Thank you for sharing.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] that was oddly beautiful and lovely and think in a small way you've memorialized this mans life in a way that many close to him may not have. Thank you for sharing :)  [end]
[start] This is like a story of revenge turned into forgiveness and deep human connection, thanks to the grace and compassion of the victim. Except that it's actually about class, anomie, and the bystander effect in the age of social media. [end]
[start] This sort of thing can brush right by you: you didn't know the guy, he wronged you, maybe he is in some proverbial 'better place' now, if only in comparison to how grim his life had become. Or it can hit you hard: the lines separating us from strangers are so thin that they can be broken by brushing up against them, and suddenly you have detailed,  almost intimate knowledge about - and possibly even feelings for or about - someone you never really knew. The theft of your phone was all it took, for you to let this guy into your life enough that you knew him as something more than "the guy who stole my phone". Even though he never knew about that.  But you were, and are, an innocent bystander. The picture you paint is not a happy one. His relationships sound somewhat desperate, certainly not particularly fulfilling. And driving a life into the ground takes more work and planning than most people want to believe it does... being unemployed, and back living with his parents, seem like the kinds of things that could cause serious depression, but they might more likely have been things he planned in a deliberate attempt to remove variables from his life so it would be easier to erase. The only one who knows for sure can't answer such questions now; everyone else is left second-guessing.  There is a natural human impulse to think "maybe I could have done something", but this is rarely the case even when you know someone well... and you had only periodic, imperfect information and no reasonable way to connect with the person. So don't feel guilty.  But *do* feel. Right now you know that random, seemingly meaningless interactions can make you feel bad. Other interactions, just as meaningless in the moment, can turn out to change lives for the better. You get to decide how you go forward from here; let it push you in whatever direction you define as "better person". That's pretty much the only thing you can do to make this death have meaning, and it's enough. Once every so often we are affected by strangers, but we are often surrounded by people for whom we are strangers... a willingness to be the good stranger when the need arrives - something most people don't even think about, unless/until something like this happens in their lives - can do a world of good. And the world is always in need of more good.  (I'm tired, sorry if this was rambling.) [end]
[start] You oddly crossed paths with a stranger who had a tragic story. Does part of you feel subconsciously guilty for not reaching out to him three years ago? (I only ask, because after reading your story, I would feel that way).  If so, I'm sure your conscious mind knows it is not your fault at all. People suffer, and there's not always a way to know of it or do anything. It's very sad that this man felt alone and helpless until it was too late. At least someone (you) has read his story. One could take it as a lesson; if a friend or acquaintance is withdrawing/going through a difficult time, reach out to them. It doesn't have to be a dramatic rescue mission, just a 'Hey I saw you posted xyz. How are you?'  [end]
[start] Damn. That is the exact same date I went into the hospital after my last(4th) suicide attempt.  [end]
[start] I tried to commit suicide on October 6, 2015. A random passerby named Fred talked me down from the ledge of a 10 story parking garage and returned me home to my then partner and mother of my youngest daughter. Did the psych hold thing at local hospital, got kicked out by unsupportive ex, went to rehab in across the country in Georgia. Tried to win her back after rehab, for the last few months. 4 weeks ago: got in a fight on the phone and told her about a woman I met on OkCupid and slept with, to which she replied, "Yeah well I was fucking Fred the whole time you were in rehab."    The chains were released from my ankles and wrists and I was freed after a decade of abuse, depression, addiction, and many dark suicidal nights; days, weeks, months and years.   I moved cities, I am in love with my soul mate. I am creative and alive again. Its a crazy thing, life, isn't it? [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] One of my friends killed himself last summer. This made him the seventh of my friends to do it. None of them knew each other. I almost did it too during a very long, very dark period of my life.   In my opinion this guy being all you feared to be, his sad story and your empathy towards it, are all about your astonishment at the fabrics of our reality, and the fact that you, everyone, is on the same boat to some extent.   At least that is what happens to me from time to time when confronting certain events, like the death or mental disintegration of a loved one. Life can be that scary.  The key word is "can". For many of us, it's about what you develop within and around you, and how. This guy, he created much of what he had or didn't have. He had many more opportunities than he ever saw, I'm completely certain. In fact, he had the opportunity to reach of for help instead of killing himself.   He had the opportunity to turn a huge mass of shit into something so much better, by virtue of some degree of conscience, luck and determination/patience. He just never got to experience himself in a way that would allow for that.    I was that guy. I read a lot, asked for all the help I could find, tried all that was available to me. I endured through inexplicable stuff, and I am now almost 100% the guy I wanted to be, at 37 years old. I love myself and my life. Much of it is thanks to having gone through such a bleak existence for more years than I want to confess, and learning my way out. [end]
[start] Well, fuck.  This kind of resonates with me, man.      See, I may as well be that guy.  I've got a lot of shit wrong with my mind grapes, and I'm old enough that most of them went undiagnosed until after it was too late (KO'd from high school).  Shitty GPA, shitty scholastic history and lack of achievements.  Inability to learn truly long-term marketable skills.  Had a period of petty crime (mostly theft).  Terrible joke of a love life my whole life.      I'm almost fourty.  I have a job that, while I enjoy it, it's far from enough, and I've been unable to get anything better for the last year.  Had a relationship blow up on me in a big way within that last year, and now I'm at a point where I'm just about ready to give up on it all.  Relationships/sex, not life.      At the moment, anyway.      I don't know what to say, man.      I mean, like you, when I was younger, I was pretty much terrified of turning out this way, but I never found an exit-ramp for my path through life.  I remember being a little kid, seeing a certain type of older guy, and just knowing that he had nothing going for him, barely any real reason to live, and I was absolutely petrified of becoming that... and now I'm that.      I mean, I guess I'm not quite as bad off as this guy was.  Even though I know a lot of it would be a bit fake, I do know that my Facebook profile will be a bigger memorial than his was.  Christ.      If it's any consolation, if he was anything at all like me... there were definitely some good and memorable times.  I mean, I largely had to fall deep into recreational drugs to get them, but they weren't all because of the drugs, y'know?      I hope you don't hold any guilt over it, at least.  The only impact you could have possibly had against his life was getting him arrested for stealing your phone.  But jail and prison don't really help people like this.  And if they do help, it's not at all in any *good* way.  It just becomes a school to becoming a bigger criminal. [end]
[start] You know, every time I've said "I hope the guy that stole my phone kills himself", I don't know if I'd want to see it happen, even after the fact and third hand via Facebook.  You should have emailed his grandmother. [end]

[start] I feel like thats my life. Gf left me for her ex, i believed she wasnt till the last moment. Right afterwards my bestfriend, the only person in my life other then her, gets a girl. Alone. Broken. And the only help is to busy fucking in the bed next to me. (friend and me live in a rv after not being able to rent a place to live with two full time 20k year jobs.) 3ish days ago i made a post explaining how alone i am and really just need a god damn lap to cry in and get pets. Im not asking for a wife or quick fuck. Just someone to look me in the eye and say im ok, to pay attention to me.. Now ive devulged to begging redditors for attention secretly hoping that an attractive young woman will recognise me. Im trying to care for myself and not need a girl. But its literally the only thing i want.. I dont care about myself if i have no one to do it for. But no one will care for me if im broken and sad all the time. So im in a perfect feedback loop of emotional longing so bad that i cant even take my own body out to the park and be confident enough to meet someone so that i have a reason to take care of myself... Everyone looks at me like im just being dramatic. But im being ignored so badly by anyone in my life that i actually fucking think a random comment rant on reddit will get me cuddles or hell even a hug. Im naieve. I deserve to be alone. I just bring people down.  Edit: tell me how im just begging for attention and this is my own problem to solve [end]

He takes them home and uses them and starts to take on the characteristics of this random family.  He starts seeing them at different places and whatnot.  It doesn't get creepy or anything, just,,, odd.  Your post reminds me of that song and album.

[start] The fact that you have sympathy for a fellow Human that killed himself speaks well of you, OP. Empathy is probably the best emotion for anyone to have, but please don't get carried away with it. Don't let yourself get dragged down by something that is, and always was, out of your control. It seems as if you have already walked more than one mile in his shoe, but it's time to forget about it. Quit dwelling on that sad crap and go grab a bite to eat at a restaurant, or go biking, swimming, or anything. Just go have fun. Peace. [end]

After the phone was returned, they tried to message him about an overdraft, but he never saw it. The bank flagged his credit rating. He went into debt. Lost his car, house... bankruptcy. No way out. Suicide.  Had he Returned Your Phone immediately -- You may have even given him a couple bucks as a reward. Maybe just enough to pay cash for a purchase instead of making his first ever overdraft.

[start] You lived vicariously through this poor boy-turned-man's sorry life. While he was already on a downhill path when he found your phone and chose to use it rather than return it, here's how I imagine this story in a Butterfly Effect method.  Boy at a theater finds a nice phone. He could return it but chooses to keep it since he's never had one so nice before. He's a new employee here and is starting to make some decent money so he adds his email and sends his bank statements to the phone. The problem is someone keeps locking his new phone every few days and calling it all the time. It's getting g annoying to own so he drops it off at the theater but forgot about the emails and pictures. Now that his manager knows about the theft he's fired from his decent job, because of you phone.  Now without his only means of checking his bank statements he's suddenly overdue and overdrafting. His life is spiralling because of that phone. He tries to get into new relationships but can't get over the fact that he isn't making enough money to survive, let alone support someone else. He has no credit now because of that phone and he can't buy even the smallest of houses. He lives in a pay-by-day hotel with nothing but a radiator heater to cook with.  He's gained such a bad attitude from the hand he was dealt by finding that phone that he can't maintain any relationship, even with his family. His only friends are his sister and grandma. There's one other person who felt sorry for him but never really liked him. It took years to get into social media because he couldn't afford a computer and therefore had no computer skills. Who would give you a credit card for a new computer when you have no standing credit?  He looks in the mirror of that crappy motel one morning and realizes that he has nothing. His life is a waste, because of that phone. All the while a stranger has been following his life and feeling sorry for him. For the past 10 years this stranger has seen a train wreck unfold which can be directly linked to that fateful day when the boy found a lost phone and decided to keep it.  The man decides to post a final update in Facebook. He watches it for a little while, hoping people would say something or give him a chance. One person says "good". The boy who decided to keep a phone kills himself. [end]
[start] It's almost as if, if you had perused things further, and could have gotten him arrested, he would have the help he needed.  Too many what if there. There is nothing you could have done. [end]

Along comes some 12 year old kid who is well versed in SQL injections, Linux, etc.  Creates himself a super powered character in the game and some other shenanigans, first by exploiting a PHP page and later just by exploiting the game client.   Talked with him off and on in IRC, very bright kid. This was in the mid 2000s and he was playing around with Solaris boxes and virtualization.   Learned from some of his friends on IRC that he committed suicide a few years ago. Fucking waste. Imagine where he would have been at 20 or 30. [end]

[start] thats a good story. Its very sad. I didnt know where it would end up. Ive found that i forgive as i get older, and many people have a worse lot than me in life.  [end]
[start] You have more empathy than some for thieves. It's an admirable quality; to realize that, beyond ourselves, others exist.  I don't claim to know how you feel, but I can imagine the sense of shock and horror at seeing something like that unfold. One of my friends committed suicide on January 29th 2015, and I'll never forget it. [end]
[start] This is the kind of story that will haunt me for months.  [end]
[start] RIP [end]
[start] Try not to let it get to you man. Life's different for everyone out there. For some people it works out fine, and for others it doesn't work out at all. That's just the way the world turns.  [end]
[start] This story has a very Mr. Robot vibe to it. Very sad though. [end]
[start] I wonder how the guy who said "good" feels now.  [end]
[start] Somehow I was hoping you would have reached out. Alas. May he RIP [end]
[start] "This perplexed me since anytime I pasted my email into Google I get over 100 pages of results but nonetheless I was determined to hunt down this dick who stole a phone I didn't even own at that point anymore. I looked at his email for a little while and realized something: he's probably using the standard email address format (first initial+lastname+random two digit number). I put this lovely tidbit of information into Google along along with the state that we are both in and what do you know: I got a facebook profile."  His email address was his name the whole time... and that wasn't immediately noticeable? [end]
[start] Phones are lost. My Samsung S7? Edge was lost to the abyss. However insight into another random humans life is a worthy exchange. Well if you go all philosophical. Perspective may cause ambiguity. Let's tell the tale of Adam and Eve from the perspective of God in a metaphorical story.   So humanity reaches a point where the creation of other sentient life is made possible. Such an ecosystem is created (lets say we can make them they're own environment and animals to eat etc). We then learn to communicate and inform the, let's call then biosentients (sentient robots are already a thing we need the subcategory), that they may not do a certain thing. Let's say (let's, let's, lets) that 'thing' is linked to understanding how they came to be as we decided they weren't ready to know. They do it any way so we just chuck the, out and start over. These biosentients then evolve and adapt to their surroundings and over take us in intelligence and technology.   So as you can see the Apple is represented by the gathering of knowledge. Also I did start writing this with the aim of highlighting how this perspective might give sympathy towards God. Well I was wrong it's just proved he sucks if he exists, perhaps it was aliens.   So in summary maybe humanity has overtaken God and that's why he's bailed. Or maybe we've overtaken the aliens. In this scenario. Let's kill them, and become gods ourselves.

[start] Well, ya know what they say,  Sucks to suck. [end]
[start] I don't know what to say. Sad world. [end]
[start] well that was filled with all sorts of feels, and some adventure, and some mystery. This was like watching a good movie.  [end]
[start] >He was what I was afraid I'd be: nearing my 40s without having found stable love while also being financially insecure  Me in a nutshell. Probly end up same as FB guy.  Interesting way to have a human moment though. Thanks for the writeup. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] This was beautiful... [end]
[start] So he stole your phone and you still felt bad for him? You're a much better man than me. [end]
[start] I had a friend kill himself. He posted on FB right before he shot himself. He said "only the good die young". [end]
[start] Me too, thanks. [end]
[start] seriously man   you dont owe this guy  shit dont feel sorry for him people die every day  just because he made the tinest connection ever to you dosent mean you have to accept it  [end]
[start] Fantastic story; thanks for sharing!  Many years ago, somebody texted the wrong number and got me. They were in a queue for a theme park or funfair or something and they were trying to text their friend's friend Jason to find out why he wasn't there yet (they were holding a place in line). I texted back to say that I wasn't Jason, but they didn't believe me (I guess Jason must be a bit of a joker) so I kept chatting by text with them, gradually getting more and more sarcastic and eventually sending them a photo of me outside my house in Wales, holding a sign that said "Not Jason" (they were in Northern Ireland) to prove that I was me. That must've persuaded them because they didn't text back: or maybe Jason finally turned up.  So I texted that evening to ask how their day went. Turns out the sender was a young lady called Emily. We bounced random ocassional messages back and forward about once every month or two, just saying hi really, for a little over a year before she stopped. But imagine how much cooler this story could have been if she hadn't. [end]
[start] Sounds like it all worked out fine. You should move on and not worry about it, this literally has absolutely nothing to do with you. [end]
[start] Speaking as someone who lives a miserable existence, fuck this guy. He chose to take something that wasn't his. No sympathy for someone who's too broke to afford integrity.  [end]
[start] I feel like i would say "good" finding out the dickhead who stole my phone died unhappy, even though when im not involved i really cant honestly say a phone thief deserves to be driven to suicide. [end]
[start] Good.  Other people making bad choices (like stealing phones) is why they end up in situations like that. You were the victim in this case, and the guy may have had a rough time, but was still a scumbag. Maybe I'm just jaded and cold, but there is no reason for sympathy for someone who treated you like that.  Anyhow, made for a good story, thanks! [end]
[start] I struggle to have empathy for someone who would steal someone's personal property.  It wasn't like they stole food to eat. [end]
[start] You know everyone's story is important. Even though I don't know you, or him, and even you don't know him. I've been affected by his story and it just goes to show that even if you think no one cares about you, someone out there will notice you've gone. [end]
[start] Haha, that stupid fucking loser. Good riddance  [end]
[start] That's the ultimate /r/prorevenge material right there. [end]
[start] He didn't steal your phone , he found it it's not the same thing [end]
[start] Thos story effected me in a deep way. Thank you so much for sharing it, OP. [end]
[start] Did you get your phone back?  [end]
[TITLE] My son just went out with friends for the first time [TITLE]
[start] Reading this felt like a "full circle" moment.  Not the same: I "Inherited" my little sister when my Mom died. I was 23 and she was 11.   She is 24 now. I remember, as she grew up & moved out, thinking "we made it!"   When I became her parent, alone, I was filled with so much fear. I did the best I could in loving & caring for her.   Thank you for posting this OP. It's heart warming.   Edit: this is my most up-voted comment on my reddit history. I have read thru the comments. Reading an outsiders POV on this topic has been interesting.   When I "inherited" my sister: I was terrified! That is an understatement! I was not married (at the time) & had very little experience with kids- other than my little sister. Even then we were COMPLETELY sister-like in our relationship. The hardest part, for me, was that I realized that I had to now be the "parent" and had to put away the "big sister" role. For a while at least. We had our moments. Now: she is grown and has children of her own. We still have our moments. It is, however, awesome to be the sister again.   For those who think "I wouldn't be able to do that"....I didn't think so either. It was not an easy journey- but we made it.   I still, to this day, cannot believe that she is grown. When she was 11 I thought that, until she was 18, the end was forever away. It is not. The time FLEW by.  [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing. This is one of the first things I read this morning. It's going to be a good day :) [end]
[start] Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. [end]
[start] That's fucking awesome. You sound like a really cool dad. [end]
[start] Dude.  That made me tear up a little. [end]
[start] From the sons point of view  http://i.imgur.com/ou3ho.png   [end]
[start] This is the best thing in the world for me, honestly. My father passed away when he was thirty-six. I was seventeen. Because our age was not that far off, we were extremely close and it often felt like he was my best friend.   The abrupt loss of my father, my best friend, hero, and hiking companion left me at a loss in the world. I still have my mom, and while her and I are just as close, there are certain things in this life that only a father can provide. Reading that you and your son shared a moment like this means the world to me. I know he valued it just as much as you did.   I still miss my father every single day. He taught me lessons in this life that I will never forget and still try to pass on to my own friends and family even now. Your son, now at a huge moment in his life, will remember everything you have taught him and guided him towards, and I know that as he takes even more strides on his hike in life, you will be there every step of the way, both physically and in spirit.   I am happy for you and your son. Keep on living your life and allowing him to live his. Share more moments with him, and if you have the time, allow us to revel in your happiness. For some of us, it could make the day all the better.  [end]
[start] Wonderful, heartwarming story OP. Thank you for brightening my day.  [end]
[start] It's Friday afternoon, I've had a shitty week (nothing major, just work stress) and this just brightened my day :)   Hopefully it's the first of many experiences like this for him! [end]
[start] Wow man. Congrats on your moment. I wish you and your son luck in the future. [end]
[start] :) [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Damnit. I want a son. [end]
[start] Everything is great about this story except the dead korean [end]
[start] What a great moment for you two, it sounds like you are eachothers best friends, which is great. I'm crying right now man,you two have a bond that will never break and it's amazing how open he is with you. Not many people at that age want to be that close to there parents but the ones that cherish it, are special. I'm sure you've raised him well along with his mother and have guided him in the right direction.  [end]
[start] what the fuck is this tingling feeling?  [end]
[start] I got that tingly feeling. I don't know you, but I am happy for you and your son. :') [end]

[start] You are a caring and sweet dad.  Your son sounds like a cool kid [end]
[start] damn, that's awesome [end]
[start] Someday, I too will friends [end]
[start] I fully understand. My second son has always struggled with having friends. Now he is 26, and still has none. [end]
[start] loved reading this - thanks!  as a 20-year old guy that doesn't have many friends, it makes me more optimistic about meeting new people, somehow. [end]
[start] Really great story, reminded of me of [this](http://i.imgur.com/ou3ho.png) I read a while back (although I know that isn't the case) [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Why is my vision blurry?  [end]
[start] Damn it, who left the onions out???  [end]
[start] he really needs to be more independant, you won't be there forever, teach him things and let him find out stuff on his own terms.  he knows you love him [end]
[start] As a Dad to three grown children I just loved this.  At some point in the late teens, unless they ask for it, our advice needs to stop and as parents we need to enter the unconditional acceptance phase.  Love them, support them and tell them how proud we are.  Period.  They are grown now and we should keep our ideas with their prejudices to our selves.  Sounds like you were doing that despite your concerns and on his own he's mustered the courage to make friends and hang out with them.  So, so much better than you nagging him with, "Why don't you go out?  Why don't you have friends?".  Way to go Dad!   [end]
[start] YAY awesome!  I'm a single Dad as well so I totally feel ya brother.  My daugher is only 1 though so I have a ways to go before I have a story like yours.  You're a good man, keep it up. [end]
[start] I never would feel comfortable sharing things like that, insecurities and social awkwardness with my father, not in a non-sarcastic way at least. May be with my mom, but not to the point of crying and hugging. You're a good parent. [end]
[start] What took him one night to accomplish takes others years. Getting digits your first night out? Kudos to him! [end]
[start] Awesome story, but I'm curious, what region do you live in to call bars cafes? [end]
[start] I wish you were my father growing up. Way to make a grown man cry. [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing. This was great. [end]
[start] :') this is the cutest thing I've read all week [end]
[start] great father  [end]
[start] OP, how was he prior to losing his mother?   See I never hung out with people as a kid because my parents were super protective and wanted to practically interview the parents of whoever I was going to hang out with, so I pretty much tried to avoid that and it pushed me away from hanging out with people after school. As I got older, friends I hung out with in school had their group of guys who'd all hang out afterwards and I was just the friend people would see at school. Wasn't until I got a job that I started hanging out during our "free time" with coworkers/now-friends   [end]
[start] Thank you for your personal story. I have a son, though he is still little he is very shy and doesn't like the same things other boys his age like. He's more of a science type of guy and he already gets called names. But I have hope. And I try to always encourage him. [end]
[start] This is heartwarming as shit. [end]
[start] This is amazing. You're an awesome father. Though my dad and I are close, we're nothing like this. I hope you and your son both have a lasting relationship and fulfilled lives.  [end]
[start] I just found this post and it is so lovely. [end]
[start] Glad to see a good father/son relationship is attainable, but at 20 years old, does he really need to ask permission to go ott? [end]
[start] Well, shit. I was mad about stupid little stuff earlier, but you're making me grin. Cheers to your son. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I don't tear up very often, but as short as this was, this was really nice to read.  Happy for you two. [end]
[start] D'awww! You should have posted this in /r/happy! [end]
[start] Your son is blessed to have a father like you. Truly blessed. [end]
[start] Fantastic!  My only concern would be that you're forming an association for him between extroverted behavior and his father's exuberance.  I have no doubt that you will eagerly cheer him on and keep him pointed in an overall positive direction as effectively as you can, but when you're gone, will he shut down?  I guess what I'm asking is, are his goals in going out with friends goals he understands and truly desires for their own sake?  Or, is he trying on some level to meet Dad's expectations?  - A regretful son. [end]
[start] 20 years old and this is his first time ever going out with friends? [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] >Dad, is it okay   ...at *20*? [end]
[start] That's wonderful =]  [end]
[start] This was a wonderful read. So often the posts in this sub are sad (understandably so), which makes this post even more uplifting! [end]
[start] Great. Love this,  Hugs!!! [end]
[start] Whenever I'm sad and need a good crying moment, I'll come back to this. You are an incredible father. [end]
[start] Your kid is probably a much cooler guy then the assholes who bullied him. I'm trying to expand my social circle as well and its not easy. Good for him! [end]
[start] I can't wait to be a dad.   Really great story OP. [end]
[start] Boom. Right in the feels. [end]
[start] That made me smile this morning. Thanks OP. [end]
[start] Bravo!  Parenting at it's finest.   [end]
[start] awww you seem like a great dad [end]
[start] What a sweet post [end]
[start] Reckoner by Radiohead was playing as I read this and I just started to cry. [end]
[start] That's amazing. I just cried out of joy for you and your son. It makes me so happy to hear that people have these relationships with their kids.  [end]
[start] hey buddy. i'm sending you a hairy, manly hug right now. hope you and that youngster continue to kick ass. [end]
[start] My sons are 3.5 and 4 months old.  I very much look forward to these situations and hope I have as good a relationship with them as it sounds like you do with your son.     [end]
[start] God damn it. Why are my eyes sweating? :( [end]
[start] This just made my day better! [end]
[start] You truly deserve more. You and your son. [end]
[start] You're doing it right. Keep up the great work.  [end]
[start] Nice work as a dad. :) [end]
[start] I actually got teary-eyed. That is great. [end]
[start] This is awesome.  [end]
[start] You have successfully reduced me, a grown man, to tears.  [end]
[start] that is really aweosme! I'm glad you have such a close relationship with your son.  I wish i could trust and confide in my dad as much as your son does in you.  That must be an awesome feeling!  keep up the good parenting.  [end]
[start] Damn.....I need to call my dad now... [end]
[start] Oh man, I almost teared up reading this. That's awesome.  [end]
[start] You're an awesome dad. This is a beautiful story. [end]
[start] Crazy because my kid I kicked him out of the house around 10 to go out and explore the world. Found that he liked his computer more than meeting new people and forging new friendships. After that day he has been in a ton of fights with asshole kids in the neighborhood. Guess I should have kept him inside til he was older. [end]
[start] Wow that is a really great positive story! It feels like I'm always hearing stories about how people just fucked up they life or some horrible news. I'm really glad to hear somebody in this world has a close tight connection with family still this day in age. I am so close to my parents and my friends are close to their but 99.9% of online sounds like their family is nonexistent.  [end]
[start] now i miss my dad.  glad you could share that moment with your son. [end]
[start] You and your son are very fortunate to have each other. Thanks for being such a fine father. [end]
[start] Sorry if I'm being cynical but this sounds like the opposite side of a copypasta where the kid would just go out and sit in the car for hours then go home to make his dad happy. [end]
[start] You are both an inspiration to us all.  [end]
[start] YAY! [end]
[start] Awe!  I love this!!!   [end]
[start] This made me so happy to read. What a great start to the day! [end]
[start] Consider a martial art, it's great for self-esteem! [end]
[start] I was so moved by this. You seem like a great father, and I wish you and your son a happy life! [end]
[start] My dad died when I was 14, you rule. [end]
[start] Your story brought a tear of joy to my eye. You sound like a wonderful father. [end]
[start] Nice man!! Happy for your kid! [end]
[start] Reading this really brightened my day. I'm so happy for you and your son!  [end]
[start] As a stay at home redditor, I salute your boy for dancing with a girl. [end]
[start] this makes me think of the Liam Neeson storyline in Love Actually [end]
[start] Can I have some loving too? [end]
[start] Wow man, I have really awesome parents, they don't restrict me, will provide me with pretty much anything I want, but they keep me in line. I probably couldn't ask for better parents.  My mother is a glorious worrier sometimes though, whenever I go out, she wakes up every 30 minutes - an hour usually. She'll often text me every few hours making sure I'm ok. (I'd take this any day over one that didn't care, if I asked for it, she'd get out of bed and come pick me up at 4am with no issues. She is still a major winner)  Something hit me hard about how excited you were for your Son to have a good time.  I think I have some of the best parents possible, sure, we have some issues, it could be a little better here and there, but it could be a million times worse. Your Son will look at his friend's parents and compare them to you subliminally, and you're coming out on top a ton of the time, I'd bet every-time. [end]
[start] silly how this brings a tear to my eye <3 [end]
[start] This is cool.  Good story, good father :D [end]
[start] That's great news for the both of you! [end]
[start] I normally don't get into this mushy crap, but that's a good story op. Too many birds fail to fly. Glad yours is spreading his wings.  [end]
[start] So happy for you.  [end]
[start] This made my heart swell up. You remind me of my dad. Good for you and your son :) [end]
[start] Welp, you get gold, thanks for that story. [end]
[start] Haha this is fucking awesome. [end]
[start] Really wish I had the connections you guys had with my parents. Thanks for sharing! [end]
[start] This is what life is man. Human interaction and Emotion on that level.  [end]
[start] You are an awesome dad it sounds like. It's great he is going out and being social [end]
[start] Right in the motherfucking feels. [end]
[start] How come my nose suddenly stings?  Thank you for sharing this story. You sound like a fucking wonderful father. [end]
[start] You are a great father. I love this. [end]
[start] This is so awesome and amazing I don't even know where to begin.  I am so happy for you and your son.  As a father I can completely appreciate your perspective.  Thank you so much for sharing this.  I hope last night was just the first of many nights your son enjoys like that. [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing this. [end]
[start] As a younger dad I am touched by your story. Thank god for men like you. Wish there were more here in America [end]
[start] 50 quid for to go to a café, think of all the pastries!!  But seriously, fair play to him and fair play to yourself! [end]
[start] Isn't it just the best thing in the world to love your kids....you can accomplish so much ...obtain piles of money.....travel  the world but, loving and nurturing your kids is life's greatest accomplishment.  Youre a great Dad!  Hat's off to all the great dad's out there!! [end]
[start] I was an only child growing up in rural kentucky, and after my parents divorced when I was only 6 I lived a fragmented, lonely life. Weeks at my dad's house were filled with lots of ranch work, because dad was really far behind on the mortgage and couldn't afford to hire on more help. I didn't too much like weekends at my mom's house because she was working two jobs, both as a server, so she could make ends meet.  There was a horse at my dad's ranch that we called 'Sage' because she had a beautiful gray coat that, in the correct light, could be percepted as a beautiful shade of her namesake. I said before that I lived a very lonely life, so when Dad unloaded Sage from the trailer that first time and she nuzzled at my hand I knew I had found my first friend.  Between feeding the animals and moving logs, I would always steal away to the stables or pen to spend a few minutes with Sage. We would play a game where she mimicked my actions; if I ran around the yard, she would follow and match my pace. A few quick head bobs, and she would return in kind. My favorite trick was to jump up in the air and watch as Sage reared her legs like a fierce stallion.  My childhood came to a shattering crash one October morning when I woke to the sound of a shotgun and dogs barking. I bolted upright in bed and yelled out for my dad, and when he didn't respond I tenuously crept from my bed and shuffled my way through the house, clutching my own self tightly.  Thats when the world around me flooded in and I heard a sound that made my stomach turn - the pained, agony filled cries of a mare and the verbose, damning curses of my dad. Disregarding shoes, the cold weather, and the possibility of imminent danger, I ran outside into the cresting sun.  My body was immediately wracked with dread. My father stood there in the stables. Doors flung wide. Buckets, rakes, and shovels were scattered. And blood. Blood everywhere. A coyote lay in the yard, riddled with buckshot.  That wasn't all. I knew it. I could sense it.  As I crept up to the stable doors, I caught a glimpse of Sage laying on the ground and I broke into a sprint for the last 12 feet. Dad turned, with a tear welling in his eye, and held up his hand, motioning for me to stay back. I ran past dad, dropped to my knees, and began sobbing harder than I've ever sobbed in my life. I lifted Sage's heavy head in my hands, and her limp neck poured blood from a fresh, warm gash torn by a hungry coyote. Between sobs, cursing the world for all its evils, and refusing to believe my only friend in the world could possibly die, I turned to my dad and begged him, implored him, demanded of him *How? How can this happen?*  My father took a knee beside me, slid a hand over my shoulder, and brought my head into his chest. He kissed the top of my head, squeezed me tight, and whispered, "Imma need about tree fiddy." [end]
[start] You are 47 and have a 20 y.o. That is awesome. [end]
[start] A dad like this deserves an award. [end]
[start] I wish my father could show his love as easily as you do.  We would both be better for it. [end]
[start] I swear I read this on 4chan from the son's view who actually made all of it up so his Dad wouldn't cry. [end]
[start] As a father of 2 young boys, great story! Thanks for sharing! [end]
[start] I think your son is set for life since he has a father like you. I wish the best for you two. [end]
[start] If I wasn't an extremely manly man, this would have brought a tear to my eye.    Savour those memories... [end]

[start] I love this. Thank you. [end]
[start] This was an amazing post to read. I wish you and your son best of luck! [end]
[start] Ahhh shit. Reading this with a pint after work and the last paragraph set me off in tears too. Happy for you man! [end]
[start] This is great, OP! So happy for you guys!  [See, it's all in your mind - sometimes you just gotta go to the cafe that is life to live!](http://i.imgur.com/w7rujTY.gif) [end]
[start] That's amazing [end]
[start] I was like your son and the way you treated him sounds a lot like the way my dad was with me. My second closest friend in high school (my dad was my first closest) lived hours away. I never really had a girlfriend. I think I was a good kid but SO much of life and getting along with people, unfortunately, has to do with conforming to social expectations. I didn't learn this until college. So I ended up being this awkward uninteresting kid who did crossword puzzles, kept tabs on his predictions for LOST, acted weird with girls he crushed on, and made stupid videos. I mean senior year things changed a little bit as people started acting like adults...i was included in social circles and felt accepted. I will never forget having my name cheered after the homecoming game as my spirit week mockumentary "aired" (a ten minute Office-esque Spirit Week recap). But it didn't quite make up for all the bullying and hateful things that had happened during the other three years.  I digress. The relationship you have with your son is one that will make more impact on his life than any other that he ever has and you are doing him a huge favor by having such a close relationship with him. My dad passed away in January. I'm only 23 and I know there will be things that I will have wanted to ask him as my marriage approaches and I start a family... but in terms of shaping me into a good person and teaching me everything I needed to know he never failed me. I have found success with work and with finding a companion because once real life hits a strong foundation in character starts to outweigh the social norms.  [end]
[start] So happy for you both! [end]
[start] That's awesome man, you sound like a great dad. [end]
[start] You. Are. Awesome.  [end]

[start] That is so sweet.  [end]
[start] As a new father,2 weeks new, with a baby in nicu, I hope to get the same relationship with my son, you sound like a good father, and a good man. [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing that touching story, I'm so happy for you and your son, right in the feels. [end]
[start] Awe!!!! I'm a25 year old girl. If I lived by you I would hang out with him!!! [end]
[start] OP is this [kids father](http://i.imgur.com/ou3ho.png)  [end]
[start] This is really touching.  But it reminds me of the kid who sleepd in his car in random lots so his parents think he has friends.   Also, if hes bullied try to work out with him at a gym or fitness center.  It really helps the social anxiety aspect of things. [end]
[start] I usually tell myself and others that I'm glad my wife and I can't have kids. But it's stories like this that make me miss that which I'll never get to experience.   Good on you both.  [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing your happiness with us. This made me happy! [end]
[start] You're an awesome father. I love my dad more than I thought I ever could. He waved all rights and my mom agreed. It was a mistake they made that thought was the best for me at the time (dad was in the Navy until last year), and I can't be mad at him for that. I was 14 when I first met him and I'm 18 now, and he's 40, mom is 47 as well.   Couldn't ask for better parents for what they've done for me the past few years. I don't always show them how much I appreciate them, but it's a good time to start. [end]
[start] Hey that's really awesome. :) [end]
[start] That's adorable. I hope he gets out more! [end]
[start] Saw title: "Why is this on the front page?  ...and I'm crying." [end]
[start] Cool story man. Here, this one is for you.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyeDBZaxFa8 [end]
[start] Jesus, man, you made my day.      I know this is how my dad feels about me and I guarantee your son knows how much you love him.     Keep up the good work.     Love,   EdgarFrogandSam.  [end]
[start] To my dead deadbeat dad:  I forgive you.  In the end, *you* missed out. [end]
[start] :') [end]
[start] This is so great. He's a lucky guy to have such an amazing dad.  [end]
[start] I can't fathom living like this.  I am very extroverted and it makes me want to find someone like this and take them on my adventures with me.   Anyone in the Detroit area wanna hang out? [end]
[start] I got a little teary reading this.  Thanks for sharing OP!!  I hope your son has many more happy excursions :) [end]
[start] thanks for the feels, man [end]
[start] That's awesome! [end]
[start] That's a real nice and uplifting story to hear. Full of hope for the future. I hope things work out - you both deserve some happiness : ) [end]
[start] I wish I had a dad like you [end]
[start] Bummer about his friend, but he seems to have a very good dad. [end]
[start] This is a genuine question, not an attack. At 20 years old, why did he ask you? Do you mean, "He asked me if I would mind being alone for the evening"? Or do you mean, "He asked my permission"? Because other than for reasons of courtesy, I don't understand a 20-year-old male asking his parent if he was allowed to go out the evening with friends.  [end]
[start] hot damn, we need more posts like this!!! [end]
[start] Sounds like he knows what he's doing. You taught him well. You should get him to wingman for you, so you could both come home with some digits! :) [end]
[start] that is awesome, why am I nearly crying? [end]
[start] Excellent! You are doing it right. [end]
[start] Great to hear of his social success. Try to not to put too much pressure on him, though, to keep up a lifestyle of partying and dating. If he's ever not lucky enough to get a number, it may cause undue stress. [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing.  [end]
[start] God dammit op, nobody makes me feel my own feelings, NOBODY! [end]
[start] That's fucking fantastic. Well done dad. :) [end]
[start] Awwwwww man.  Damn I teared up reading this shit.  That's great! [end]
[start] From someone who didn't have a great dad, you're fucking awesome.  [end]
[start] cute! [end]
[start] Really wish I could have this type of relationship with my parent. Good father! [end]
[start] An up vote and a cheers mate.  [end]
[start] Your son's story is kinda similar to Perks of Being a Wallflower. [end]
[start] That's awesome you two have a great relationship.  That's one of the most important things to me as a father.  [end]
[start] Awesome.  Yay [end]
[start] Great read. Hope your son goes out more often.  [end]
[start] For post like this is why i dont stop wasting my time on reddit, thanks op [end]
[start] It's stuff like this that makes me super emotional. I wish I had this type of relationship with my father. [end]
[start] As a single father with a close relationship with my son, good on you, sir. [end]
[start] That's really weird. [end]
[start] Your fucking son goes out once and is already way more successful then I am at getting women.  [end]
[start] This gave me goosebumps, man. [end]
[start] Honestly, I almost cried too. Very happy for you both. Please tell me you have already given him the sex talk. [end]
[start] You sound like an amazing person and father. This made me feel all warm inside [end]
[start] This is is so beautiful! good on you for being an awesome dad! Your son sounds great :) [end]
[start] The world needs more parents like you. :) This is the kind of father I hope to be. [end]
[start] Good story, even though it is a little sad [end]
[start] Love hearing stuff like this. [end]
[start] Wow, great story. Congratulations on just being an awesome dad. I am a newish father, I have an 18 month old son. It's strange to think about, I am 32 years old now, so when my son is 20, I'll be 51. It's hard to imagine. It'll probably get here faster than I think.  Got any words of wisdom for a newish father? [end]
[start] Oh fucking hell man. Fucking hell.  I'm very happy for you. [end]
[start] You make me want to be a father. [end]
[start] [excuse me while i go get a tissue, it's dusty around here dangit](http://i.imgur.com/Ay29K.jpg) [end]
[start] Dudeee. That's awesome. For both of you.  [end]
[start] twist ending: turns out he went somewhere and sat in his car for hours because he knew it would make you happy if you thought he was going out with freinds [end]
[start] I hope that's the watershed moment for him. Make sure he builds on his successes!  [end]
[start] Beautiful story. Can't imagine how happy you must have been.  [end]
[start] His mother has been gone for 6 years. It's time to get back together with Aunt Robin. [end]
[start] Bestof. Yes. You win. [end]
[start] Your happiness made my week! [end]
[start] That's awesome :) I'm very happy for both of you!  Good luck to your awesome son as he comes out of his shell :) [end]
[start] Great Love! [end]
[start] I love my dad. I just wanted to say that. [end]
[start] Damn... I wish my father did that when I went out on my own for the first time. Thankfully mum was there.  [end]
[start] I've been on here for a year and I think this is my favorite post all time!  All of our sons struggle with one thing or another, so victories like this are huge!  Congrats!  I hope he gets his girl! [end]
[start] oh god feels [end]
[start] i think i got something in my eye while reading your post..  man, i wish my old man wasn't an asshole manchild. having a good dad is terribly underrated. [end]
[start] When I'm 47 my son will be 20. I hope I'm still alive, I hope he wants me in his life like that. All very awesome. Any advice for me good sir? [end]
[start] I'm very happy for you OP. I'm glad you have such a tight relationship. [end]
[start] Take it easy with the tough love tiger-dad.  [end]
[start] This was an awesome story to read. You seem like not only a great father, but a great man. I'm glad your son had a fun night out. [end]
[start] As someone who constantly worries about the happiness of his father, and used to drunk text him every night for a year straight this made me fucking bawl like a little bitch. [end]
[start] You sound like an amazing father. He's lucky. (:  [end]
[start] i would like updates on how the rest of this story goes.... please? [end]
[start] this is pretty great. good job OP :)  [end]
[start] this is pretty great. good job OP :)  [end]
[start] This made me cry as well.  Cheers to you and your son! [end]
[start] y doe [end]
[start] Oh the feels of this post and all the comments what a beautiful time to be alive! Bless you all! [end]
[start] awesome brother. [end]
[start] I'm too high for this, this is too deep man. [end]
[start] Such a simple story but it made me well up. I am 22 and I don't leave my apartment. This makes me happy. [end]
[start] This made me happy [end]
[start] Wow. Im honestly amazed that people have this type of relationship with their dad. It brings me to tears reading this. im happy for your son and you. i hope he finds a group of friends where he is able to be himself and be comfortable.  Im the son of a police officer, and lets say being comforting and loving was DEFINITLEY NOT in his nature. He treated me like an inmate. demanded authority and for me to follow his rules.  Im sure your son knows what a loving, caring father you are. All the best for you guys [end]
[start] I just melted. [end]
[start] Holy shit the tears [end]
[start] Ah the feels! You sound like a great guy, and if your son needs another gaming friend let me know!  [end]
[start] That was intense. Sounds like a rad morning. [end]
[start] Man I don't know why but this is some strong emotions you stirred in me. Best of luck to you and your son! [end]
[start] Wow, this really makes me upset that I never had a father in my life. You sound like an amazing dad. Kudos to raising a great son. [end]
[start] My Dad OD'd when I was ten and I have absolutely no family. The relationship you described with your son is literally the same as my Mom and I. She has sarcoidosis and is on oxygen 24/7 but I'm a certified nurses aide so I take care of her. She's taken care of me for the past year as I became incredibly ill, and I wouldn't have made it without her. She is my best friend and I'm so lucky to have her. Your son is so lucky to have you, this post made me cry a little. You're a great Dad. I'm so happy you guys got to have that moment, its the little things in life :) Edit: Fixed typo. [end]
[start] I'm blown away by this. I'm 27 with a son just a few months away (middle of August). I hope I'm as excited for him and his prospects as you are with your son. I really do hope that. [end]
[start] You sound like the best Dad ever :))))  [end]
[start] OMG this is beautiful. [end]
[start] Good job, Dad! My brother is having similar problems moving forward in his life. It's empowering to see you help your son to beat it!  You are a truly remarkable father. Keep up the good work!  [end]
[start] Goddammit. I Don't come to Reddit for these types of feels. [end]
[start] This is why I love reddit. *Hugs* [end]
[start] This is fucking awesome! :D [end]
[start] That's the fakest shitpost I've ever seen. Good job newfag. [end]
[start] Take it from a 20 year old former introvert. You rock man! If there was ever such a thing as a good father it has to be you. [end]
[start] Thanks OP, as someone who struggles with the ideas of becoming a parent. It's moments like this that warm my heart and ready it for my future child. [end]
[start] I wished my dad loved me as much as you love your son. [end]
[start] This should be on best of. The feels man.  [end]
[start] I'm so happy for both of you. This is amazing. [end]
[start] I teared up  [end]
[start] I read this in class and almost teared up.  Oops. [end]
[start] Aaaand now I'm crying. [end]
[start] Awww.  Sorry, just cannot add anything else useful. :D [end]
[start] Wait till he gets laid you're going to flip [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Cute but creepy. Next time your son is drunk let him fall into bed you fussbudget. [end]
[start] HI five fellow troll [end]
[start] [Tag Cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/xqS9yF5.png)  A Tag Cloud bot ran by /u/martjoh [end]
[start] I've seen this before...   Someone link that 4chan post where a guy at the age of 20 pretends to go out, but just sits in his car and sleeps.. His dad hugs him and cries too.  OP, I have doubts about your story, this is too coincidental.  [end]
[start] He is 20 years old. Why does he ask you if it's ok to go out? [end]
[start] "Café" are you two by chance in France ? [end]
[start] Excellent.. his shell was just a little tougher to get through. Good father. [end]
[start] I feel so happy just reading that from a dad's perspective.  Made my day, thanks. [end]
[start] Holy shit you made my eyes water! [end]
[start] d'awww :) [end]
[start] I shed a tear and I'm supposed to be a manly man. That's awesome!  [end]
[start] Thanks for the Friday Feels. [end]
[start] I hope that wasn't a fake number, is all. [end]
[start] Those feels, burns so deep [end]
[start] This made me tear up. That's just so great! [end]
[start] Great story [end]
[start] This is so nice. [end]
[start] [In this thread](http://imgur.com/wxpOaTK) [end]
[start] EMPATHY PARTY!!!!!! [end]
[start] Those feels.  [end]
[start] Good job Dad.  Really great job. [end]
[start] My son is 10...we lost his mother and baby brother two years ago.  One day, I hope to have this heartwarming of a story.  Thanks for letting us into your heart. [end]
[start] Amazing. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for sharing! [end]
[start] This. This is why I wish I had a father.  [end]
[TITLE] Tonight I was reminded of how people see me. [TITLE]
[start] I don't think you're a loser. I would care more about someone's personality and character than I do about their career. I respect the hustle too.  [end]
[start] I don't want to invalidate you but this is NOT how most people feel and I don't know where you got this idea from. Our age group (18-35) are notorious for having trouble finding jobs. Our generation is living at home into our 30s now because we can't afford to rent or buy homes. I suffer from depression too and I know that it can make my feelings and view of things a lot worse. Try to ignore people like your boss. The world is filled with a lot of kind people. [end]
[start] Don't ever feel bad because you do a low paid job. People want call centre assistance and they want to drink in bars and stay in hotels - but they don't want you to get paid well for doing these things and then act like they are better than you. These people are assholes. The best way to stick it to them is a life well lived. I wish you every success. [end]
[start] What your boss said was so fucked up. She should be grateful that there are people willing to do those minimum wage jobs because a lot of companies and industries relies on these type of people to function. If it weren’t for people like you, she wouldn’t have a place to manage. Plus you should look for ways to make a side income, cause what you’re making right now is really little, and increasing your streams of income will help you build your wealth. [end]
[start] The very predictable advice at the top of this thread "learn to code" is a fucking meme at this point. Individual solutions to systemic problems get us nowhere.  [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing, it’s well written.  [end]
[start] I’m proud of you :) [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Ignore those arseholes. It's a failure of society that someone with ANY full time job doesn't make enough to live on. It shouldn't matter if you have a "glorious" white collar job or a "menial" blue collar job.  Work is work. We're each contributing to the economy, paying taxes. Minimum wage should be enough to live on, and CERTAINLY should be nothing to be ashamed of.  I'm sorry that you've met people who think incorrectly, but they are knob heads. There are plenty of people who don't look down on minimum wage workers, myself included. [end]
[start] I have a suggested change for your title:  Today I was reminded how one specific person* sees me, and why I shouldn't care.  You aren't a loser. I know it isn't worth much for an internet stranger to say this but you must love yourself and know what you're worth. Hint: It's not in how much money you make.  You are not a loser. Keep on fighting, and you will win. God bless friend. [end]
[start] You’re doing so amazingly. I worked minimum wage throughout high school. Every job I have had is minimum wage. Congrats on doing so well for yourself.  I know you are working ten times harder than that lady. She has no right to judge people for the jobs they hold.  It’s odd that she is judging someone who is making her money and making her job possible. ...and also saying that the government should fund her medication, but not give you a living wage? She’s fucked up (sorry).  You didn’t have the luxury to study at college straight after high school, you weren’t able to hold out for something better, you will take the job in front of you now rather than get in debt and wait. I say good for you. You’re a strong person, and I bet you know more about the world, love, and life than this woman and many of us who have had an easy life.  I hope they raise minimum wage for you.   [end]
[start] I think a lot of people place way too much importance on what job they have, they get really invested in office politics, their only friends are work friends, they measure their success against what they are told they should have and want by society, and I usually just find it all a little sad.  There is nothing wrong with working a minimum wage job, there's nothing shameful about having a lower annual income.  You work a job so you can live, you don't live so you can work. Work is a means to an end. I've been fortunate enough to have stumbled into a career where I don't have to bring my work home with me, but I think regardless of what your job is it's important to try to maintain a healthy distance whenever possible.  Your life is your life, and even if it's something as simple as unwinding on Reddit after work, that's important, that's *your* time.  It can be difficult, but try not to base your self worth on other people's standards, there's a good chance their lives are just as empty and unfulfilling as they want you to believe your own is. [end]
[start] If this interests you, you can learn how to code off of YouTube videos. Not even joking. You can learn everything you need from them. Learn HTML first. Then CSS. Then Bootstrap. Then Javascript. Then jQuery. Do it for 600 hours and then go apply for a job at $60k - $80k. While working p learn done newer technologies like React, Vue or Angular. Within 5 years of coding you can easily make $100k. It sounds hard but it inst like isn't. You just have to be dedicated. The more you learn the easier it gets. And learning a computer language isn't like learning a speaking language. You don't need to learn hundreds/thousands of terms. Just a few dozen. And you reuse them over and over. If you like problem solving, working with computers, and like to create you should go for it. If be happy to steer you in the right direction. [end]
[start] I’m really sorry to hear all that, can’t even imagine what it must feel like. I hope you don’t let it upset you, and I hope you can see how much you have already achieved! You seem like you have goals in life and you work hard, and I believe in you.  Have a nice evening and enjoy all that tasty food 👍🏼 [end]
[start] Don’t let how people see you bother you. No one knows exactly what you’ve been through so it’s easy for people to judge other people. You are only 30, and that’s still very young in my opinion. Working in a call center is difficult work! I applaud you for doing that! I don’t know what type of call center you work for but I’m sure you have to talk to some people who are just rude! You are NOT a loser. It sounds like you work very hard and just keep it up! Maybe try something that you have interest in! It’s never too late to switch careers. I went to college, and sometimes I debate about why I ever went to college or if I’m in the right career or if I should switch. Plus I still have all this student loan debt. So sometimes the grass isn’t always greener on the other side!  [end]
[start] You are not a loser. You're an inspiration.  Keep on showing the world that you won't give up. [end]
[start] Theres this idea, I cant rememeber from who, but it was some popular academic who knew their shit, that people like you and what you have achieved, are our version of a modern day hero.  Not someone who excells in their profession, or wins some important sporting event, but someone who has really had to dig deep and find it in themselves, defing all odds,  and a lot of bad luck, to even just survive in this world.  It sounds like what you have achieved is a god damn miracle. Something that goes unoticed, all too often. [end]
[start] No job is shameful, what is shameful is being a shameless freeloader. You're not that [end]
[start] Exactly why I absolutely despise people who say money isn't everything. You have to be rich to think that way in the first place. It determines our value in the eyes of society. It's the difference between sleeping in a cardboard box and a bed. People don't spend 40+ hours a week working for nothing. Money is their livelihood.  [end]
[start] I hate seeing people much older than me, being slave driven at minimum. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] This really touched me, and I hope you're feeling better after a really shitty thing being said to you. If you ever need someone to talk to then don't hesitate to PM me. No one who has worked as hard as you have deserves to be put down for what they do. All work is honorable, and anyone who's employed is giving a service to someone. Don't ever let anyone tell you that isn't worth something. We all have our necessary place in the larger picture. Peace, love, and blessings. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Typical capitalist attitude tbh from your boss. You probably *should* focus more on having fun and cultivating hobbies you enjoy. Working your way up the business world is not a recipe for a good life, and you'll just find more and more people like your boss as you go [end]
[start] I respect you so much. Your ability to stay strong and move forward is inspiring to me and it’s something that you should be proud of.   Don’t let other people get to you and burn these incredible qualities that you have. You can do this and I hope you know you’ve impacted a lot of people with your writing. Thanks for sharing :) [end]
[start] God your boss is such a shit.  She actually believes minimum wage (in the US, fuck your laws are terrible) jobs should exist and that people deserve that life because they can't do 'better'. And she said that straight to you, knowing exactly your role and income. What a foul excuse for a human.  Slavery should not be a thing any more! A 'job' should afford you a sustainable living. You shouldn't basically be homeless while having a job.  &#x200B; [end]
[start] People that work at the minimum wage are middle class in this country and this day and age. Very sad [end]
[start] Her take on minimum wage is absurd and offensive and not based in reality.   I think you should be proud of yourself, many people are not self sufficient or can not pick themselves up when they are down. You can do both of those things.  I hope that you’ll find more and more opportunities in your career.  [end]
[start] I too have had bull shit jobs and people critiquing my career choices. At my husbands graduation, his father asked when I was going to school. I scoffed and said “when I’m sure I have roof over my head and when it won’t leave me in debt for the rest of my life”. I have been told I’m capable of so much more but, the reality is not everyone has the same opportunities. Some people have a “bad hand” and we make due with it. I work trade. I’ve used my trade skills to move up and keep myself fed and warm. I’ve fought hard to get where I am now. I’ve sacrificed and tried different things to figure out where I belong and what I wanted to do. Now at 28, I finally feel “happy”. I’m buying a house, I have two cars (not new but, are in good condition and reliable) I’m finally getting health insurance. Now I work 40 hours a week at a modest pay and I have the time and space to work my trade at home. Eventually, I hope to just work for myself. Never give up. Never let others belittle you. Never let them get to you. Use that energy against them and better your self.  [end]
[start] I know what it’s like to feel like you’ve wasted a decade or more of your life by going through the motions and I know what it’s like to continue going through the motions while every fiber of your being is begging not to be here anymore.   It is not easy and every day feels like a battle. I recognize you and your efforts and am honestly so proud that you are still here because it sounds really tough. You sound very discouraged and the fact that your body just cries everyday for some release breaks my heart. I’ve been there and although I am a bit younger than you, I want to tell you that it can get better.   Time is tricky. You are still here and for that, today should be your new starting point. You’re bogged down by the time you feel was wasted so you have to reorient yourself. If not now, when?  [end]
[start] When I was in my early twenties and working 60 hours a week and barely getting by, some people I sought advice from said I must not be budgeting properly.   That is how I learned that people who have never worked and lived on minimum wage have no idea what they’re talking about and, frankly, their points of view are irrelevant.   The experiences of poor and working people are the experiences of the majority of Americans, and people worldwide. Our experiences should be centered, period. Have you thought about getting involved in politics? Your voice would be worth much more to the people of your state then the voices of people who have succeeded, or were born successful, within our economic system, but have never thought deeply about the system.  [end]
[start] Just another thirty-something here who has just made her way into being almost middle-class income bracket after a childhood and young adulthood of poverty and working my ass off. You're not alone and we're stronger than the people like your boss.  [end]
[start] I hear you on the working a shit job and being abused by employers. All my friends moved away to uni and I'm still stuck doing the same shit and have the exact same story of breakdowns and being suicidal.  I hope we find an answer for this shit bro, I'm a message away if you need to have a joint bitching fest.  [end]
[start] You'll be in my thoughts and prayers OP ! And you're not a loser, far from it. This post has given me inspo to get my butt off the couch. Sending lots of love 🌸 [end]
[start] You have absolutely no reason to feel anything but pride. You get up everyday and work your butt off. A lot of people would give up, but you didn't.  Your boss sounds nasty! Unfortunately a lot of bosses can be this way. My partner has this at his job. He has caught the boss laughing at the fact he's fired people right on top of Christmas. Some people just let the power go to their head. I hope you eventually see your true worth.   [end]
[start] I don't know you. But your story really touched me. As someone who grew up poor, this resonates.  You're worth it. Your worth life. You're worth love. And you matter. Please don't ever give up hope! In my twenties I worked in a call center and really hated my life. It wasn't until my late thirties that I was finally able to climb into a higher-paying job.  I never thought I would make six figures. I was just like you watching everyone else go to college. Feeling like a loser for not doing the same.  Guess who doesn't have school debt? It's never too late my friend. God bless you! [end]
[start] I wish you grace Sweetie.   And I pray things get better ❤❤ [end]
[start] The days of getting recognition and a decent pay rise with the same employer are long gone and rare.  You need to switch jobs every few years adding a couple of k each time  [end]
[start] You're the strongest internet person I know.   Keep at it dude. You've made so much progress for yourself and that's what you need to keep in mind. It's for YOURSELF. Not for those 2o year olds who never worked a hard job.   [end]
[start] That "theory/idea" your boss exposed concerning poor people and how they should feel about their job is some of the most fucked up shit I've ever heard : this type of people is exactly what is wrong with this turbo-capitalism-society of ours in which the fact that half of us are struggling to get by day to day can solely be justified by "you didn't try hard enough" even though it's the complete fucking opposite.  I sincerely sympathise with you and more generally our generation and truly wish you the best.  [end]
[start] you may not know this, but you are already more successful than probably 95% of the people born after 1990.... [end]
[start] I worked fast food an hour or two away from Seattle around the time they passed their $15/hour minimum wage law. You'd be surprised how many people took receiving their fast food order as an opportunity to tell me I didn't deserve to be paid that much [end]
[start] You write well - that’s unusual.  I’m middle aged and a manager in a large organization and I can tell you you present as smarter and more responsible than most people in my organization.  It’s a local government in a large city, and if you got any job here I expect you would rise over the years.   [end]
[start] Honestly, I think you're my new hero. So many people with so much privilege manage to totally screw up their lives by 30. You've got tenacity and strength of character that are rare. You've climbed a frickin mountain to get where you are! I hope the slope gets less steep, I hope you don't need to cry as much, but I know you'll keep climbing. ♡  [end]
[start] Your current  boss is wrong about everything.   And I suggest trying to look at your boss from a different angle. Why would someone in a junior management position hold the opinion, personal and political, that that person does? Trying to feel like they are better than you because \*they\* feel inadequate? Because \*they\* feel like everyone else is more successful? Because saying that to you is scoring cheap points to make themselves feel better about not having the same ambition you do?  Is some one here afraid that you, in a couple of years or less, might be more successful than they are, stuck in junior management role with no decent prospects?  Junior and middle management have a reputation for being awful people because they often have to sit tight in those relatively low-paying jobs (for the education and effort needed to keep them) for years and years fighting among the other low-level managers for that one chance at promotion they will never get because some MBA will just get hired in from outside and skip the whole tier.   Your manager who said those pathetically "capitalist" bullshit things to you is not talking about you, they were talking about themselves using you as a sounding board for their own frustrations. I guarantee it.     &#x200B;  I would say (and this is from experience, where a lot of what you write OP, chimes a bell with my own situation not so long ago) that you really need to get out of call center work and find another type of job. It seems impossible at times, and takes years to accomplish (but so does studying for an exam, and then that time is passed and it feels like it was a short moment all along).    Also, work on your interview technique and prepare in advance for those typical questions like weaknesses and strengths, they are looking for use-cases from experience and personal insight. Keep it upbeat. Seriously, pretending to be a part of the successful "made-it-already" crowd goes a  long way. Assimilate, or fake assimilation! [end]
[start] I've got mad respect for you. You're struggling with so much but you are still here kicking and even though it took a lot of time you worked your way out of poverty yourself. That's damn fucking impressive! Enjoy your McFlurry mate, you so much deserve it <3 [end]
[start] People who stereotype poor people are incredible, and, if anyone, it is them who should be looked down upon. And there are places where these people are the norm, although where I live they are more rare.  [end]
[start] I relate to this so much. I've found a way out for now, working a trade. You should really consider contacting local labour unions asking about apprenticeship opportunities, you don't need experience and they're often desperate.  Remember that money isn't everything though, after you've paid your bills, once you can live somewhat comfortably. Personally I feel less ambitious about making money after having gone from cleaning for minimum wage, to more than double that...  How much stress do you want in your life, what are your needs and wants? What wants don't really come from within you but from what you think other people want?...  I reminisce about my days scrubbing toilets. I made less money and felt pretty aimless, but i had time to enjoy my life, and had fewer work stresses.  Maybe it's time to move to a bigger city with more opportunities?...  [end]
[start] I honestly just want to give you a hug. I cried a little reading this. Not just because there was so much emotion in the words but  also for the realization that I probably have at least a few friends who feel what you’re feeling but don’t ever talk about it.  [end]
[start] You tell the world who you are through your actions, which are extremely adrimable. I don't know a lot of people with your work ethic . You are not defined by your job, your salary or other people's thoughts. Your boss sounds like a horrible person, you are valid and deserve people you treat who better.  [end]
[start] You are clearly a hard worker and know how to set goals and meet them.  That should be the most important info about you - your pay rate should be irrelevant in how people view you, but I know from my younger days at low wage jobs that it does factor in.  If you plan to stay in the IT field, you may want to focus on security which is in demand and higher paying.   I know you are focused on a particular path right now, but for other readers who may be in a similar place, the trades are definitely the way to go.  You can earn really good money, there are fewer  young people going into that area so demand is higher, and there are trade schools that you can attend using student loans just like other higher education schools.     [end]
[start] Your boss is a complete idiot. I’m sorry you had to listen to her nonsense.  [end]
[start] You are not a loser AT ALL! I can't describe the tremendous amount of respect I have for you for pulling through, year after year, and being where you are now, sounds like an amazing accomplishment, even though sometimes it may not feel like it. With your attitude I do not doubt you'll land in a place that fulfills you financially and mentally. Fuck what others may say, you're an incredibly strong person that will still achieve a lot before they're done. And if all else fails, just know that I am incredibly proud of you ❤️ [end]
[start] What your boss said is borderline hostile work environment. She sees you in a negative light and you should report her. [end]
[start] You are awesome.  You have struggled and won against so many things that others have not been able to conquer.  You have done the best you can and it shows.  Youth and age will always see things from different places.  The things she said would have hurt if anyone had said them to you.  The victory is yours by not falling back on self destructive coping strategies.  Admitting your feelings. Seeking support.  I don't know you and I am proud of you.  Struggling a little myself ( see user name, first post) [end]
[start] Very well written. You described your feelings really well.   I wish you success in your pursuit. And you should be damn proud of yourself for taking care of your bills.  [end]
[start] It sounds like you're a very hard worker. Why not go to college or learn a trade? Typically what keeps people from succeeding at these things is a lack of dedication or effort. It sounds like you would be just fine, though.  [end]
[start] Imo anyone who judges you for your job when you're clearly a hard-working and determined person like you obviously trying to get out of it is a bad person. [end]
[start] I see you as pretty fucking heroic. [end]
[start] Anyone not living in/born in/ going through poverty should simply be grateful for their lot. Yes, people work hard to get where they are in life. However; MOST people living privileged lives had a LOT of help getting there. Parents with money, early job breaks, etc. ANYONE living in privilege should be nothing but grateful. NO ONE gets there alone.  I’m sorry you are going through what you are going through. You seem like a good person. Soon you will reap the fruits of your labor.  [end]
[start] >  I try to remind myself that I've done the best I can and should be proud for that reason.   You should be. Don't look to others for validation, people can put others down without even realising it. What you've managed with your life is astonishing. Many people will never understand what it's like to truely struggle for a living, they have little to compare to. [end]
[start] Absolutely shameful that people would disrespect the effort you put in. I really hope things get better for you [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing this eye-opening strategy. I learned a lot from it man  [end]
[start] You are not a loser. It’s hard out there. I believe in you.  [end]
[start] Solidarity. The system is fucked, get through the best you can and find others who feel the same way. (There's a lot of us) [end]
[start] If you beat poverty you're far from a loser. Doing that is so difficult and so many people can't do it. I'm so sorry that you've been mocked for your job and have had such a hard life. I genuinely admire your bravery and ability to move forward even when everything seems so shitty. I really hope everything improves for you and I hope you get that better paying job by next year. Your story is inspiring, don't let the negativity or disdain of others bring you down.   [end]
[start] Don't worry the civil war is soon [end]
[start] It seems like the problem here are your surroundings - hard as it may be, get yourself as far away as you can, go somewhere where the mentality is focused more on societal values & community, rather than individual wealth.  Sell all your assets, make a clean break. [end]
[start] You're an inspiration. I'll be a better person thanks to you. [end]
[start] I hope that your boss sees this. You are doing good, honest work and not hurting anybody. And you are working towards something. You should be very proud of that. [end]
[start] I'm proud of you. You have made it this far, and I know that wasn't easy. Never give in, never give up. Keep proving you can make it. I'm rooting for you.  [end]
[start] Your coworker is delusional. Poverty is a carefully manufactured capitalist agenda that keeps the masses so busy struggling to survive that they don’t have the time to interfere with their machinations. 75% of Americans don’t even have 5k in the bank. Your value isn’t measured by your income. Be well.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] You are NOT a loser! You are a hard worker! Don't think less of yourself because of your boss' careless comments. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Wow. Im really sorry she said that to you. I hope you get the job.  [end]
[start] You're here and you matter. Your boss and colleagues plus who ever is putting you down are nothing but unaware shitheads. You know your situation you are conscious and aware of who you project into the public which is very good. Self awareness and self reflection is very important for someone who is developing as a human, because we're not perfect. I have been in your shoes I know what it feels like, and it's shit. I'm not sure if you tried anything to change your outlook on life, but what helped me was smoking marijuana with a low percentage of thc and a high percentage of cbd. After smoking a quarter of my first cbd joint; I had some self reflection and how I can change and grow as a human. [end]
[start] You're making more than I was when I started in a call center. I'm in my early 30s and worked in one after college for a few years, and eventually hopped around other departments in the same company (bank) until I made it into compliance. I stayed there for a few years and now an helping to head a new department... and an getting paid a few k less than the higher level contract center reps.  You're a hard worker, which is rare for contact centers. Find a company in an industry you're interested in that also has a contract center and try to move up from there. I took several lateral moves just to get experience. And, you generally don't get a decent raise by stayng with the same company. Apply to another place, say you were making 5k more than you are, and you may have them meet or exceed that figure. Let me know if you have any questions out if I can help at all. Good luck.  [end]
[start] You don't judge a persons worth by how much they earn and i promise you a whole lot of other people don't either. I am still learning the warning signs that someone you meet is that shallow - they are best avoided. I am working part time retail, living at my parents as an 'oldie' while i get treated for depression. I judge myself enough, nobody needs other people to judge. Keep at it, stay strong and best of luck. [end]
[start] You are not alone in such situation. There are different standarts of living around the world but the same pressure by society and your own expectations. That's just how modern world and capitalism working. Money makes money. And if you don't have some from the beggining, you gonna have a hard time climbing up. But your boss has some point, there is a difference between people. Some just surrender and some trying to change it and achive more. Surrender is for the weak. And as far as I see, You are not weak. You are not criminal, or on the drugs, you trying to overcome the situation step by step. There is a lot of things to be upset about, but not the idiota who cannot understand and appreciate that. Good luck! [end]
[start] I'm 36, my experience is that it will only get worse.  My misery at 30 has only been magnified and I spend almost all free time unable to get out of bed. Impossible to find connection,  steady jobs or worthwhile opportunity. Gen zed (working with 20-25 year olds) I've noticed they are infinitely more positive,  social and cheaper in my field.  Only a few more years and I'll be replaced, homelessness is coming back and the dread is weighed heavy on my chest.   I empathize with you, but also think "welcome to the club." By my account we're all failures in some regard. My big dream was making movies (and by God, what a  fucking simpleton notion) and I feel stupid and guilty for being so certain in my 20's that it'd happen for me. I mean I call myself a fucking loser all the time. Is this not how other people feel? [end]
[start] I'm 33M, and I can definitely empathize. I dropped out of college, because I had now idea of direction I wanted to go into. I ended up working 2 jobs and essentially lost all of the friends I did have because of everyone else splitting into different directions and cities. I have always been a hard worker and scaled the ranks of the places I worked out. I was trying to start up my own photography business while delivering pizzas when I got engaged almost 8 years go (the photography fell through because I am not an extroverted person so making new contacts was really hard for me to do). Before getting married, I became Assistant Manager at the pizza place, and within a year I was manager (although having no idea what fair base pay would be, the owner who I had become close to set me at $28K salary where I was working 6 days a week (\~55 hours) plus having to drop in every day I was supposed to be off because I couldn't find any reliable employees that would work what was needed for the job below minimum wage + tips). I agreed to work for $28K for the workload because I respected the owner and he promised me that they were going to open up a new location within the next year closer to where I lived and that it would essentially be 'my store' where I would also be making a percentage of all profit from it: which never happened. While working as a a manager, I was also taking online classes at University of Phoenix online for a business degree- which, being graduated now for over 5 years, still hasn't effected my hiring or position of employment. I literally almost killed myself in my mid 20's because of the stress and lack of sleep I was placing myself under, much less how much my marriage was suffering with us also having my first son born 10 months after our wedding. It took a physical toll on my body, but all the ER could come up with was that it was 'psychosomatic' and 'stress induced'. My back kept seizing up, and I had to put in two weeks to that job. I was jobless for 3 months, and my brother-in-law hired me on to his landscaping crew (he and another guy) and he was paying me $9-10/hour for seasonal work which helped immensely in that time. I ended up around a year later going to an employment agency, got this job in an autoplex warehouse with pulling part orders for body shops within Mississippi. A year into working here with making minimum wage, I was promoted to be a 'parts counterperson', and now I am getting paid collective commission on all parts into the shop or out of town to other shops. I haven't 'made it' in life but I'm closer to $40k now. Even though I have worked hard, God has really been pivotal through the thick and thin and opening up opportunities. The parts department of a dealership is treated as a necessary evil and even though salesmen will need things from us from time to time, they tend to snub their noses at us because of that economical difference that middle class people tend to have with minimum wage workers.   &#x200B;  I saw in a different comment you mentioned that you are trying to gear towards a help desk position within IT. I'll be praying for you regarding that and that you can come to a point in your life where you will not self-harm or cry all night no matter what happens throughout the day. You are valuable. You are special. Your job is replaceable, but you as a person are unique and worth more than any amount of money or whatever label culture would deem as success this week.  [end]
[start] I just want to say: you seem like an amazingly hard worker and even better than that, a nice, empathetic, good person.    I don't know you personally, but based on the information in your post, is it out of line for me to say I'm proud of you? Because I am. And you should be proud of yourself for everything you've done. You deserve it! [end]
[start] Hey OP, I just wanna chime in with my view on a career. I'm 27 and haven't worked minimum wage in a while now, but have worked since I was like 15 and IMO the whole notion of "having a career" and a "job you love" is total bullshit lol. I'd much rather be spending my time with my family and friends than worrying about work. I mean I like my job but I hate it too... Pay grade does not reflect quality of character or societal worth. I build apps for a living and in all honesty the work I do pretty much contributes nothing to society. My sister is a neurologist researching Alzheimer's disease and she earns less than me. Like how does that make sense??!! It's wrong, broken and just plain stupid. [end]
[start] Sorry to hear that some people around you are entitled assholes.  But, as other have said, many many more of us can relate.  Don't let these people color your world view.  Classisim is alive and well today.  Fuck all that noise. You are putting in the work to better yourself and improve your life.  Some people just can't understand what it is to struggle to get ahead.  Keep on pushing for whatever goals you have and leave all the toxic haters by the wayside. [end]
[start] It really frustrates me when wealthy folks imagine how living on minimum wage is just living an "uncomplicated" life.   Most people have no clue that being poor in a developed country (where there are few meaningful communities and we've bought our way out of togetherness) psychologically deprives you of the very things that make life enjoyable: purpose, shared experience, stability, hope for the future, legacy, self-betterment, learning, and giving back.  But for YOU op, I'm so glad some of the grind is behind you. I genuinely hope for new relationships, opportunities, and excitement in your life -- and that you continue to surprise yourself with self-love =) [end]
[start] I relate to everything you've said. Graduated college and took a job in the meantime while I applied. Nothing ever worked out, I was stuck in that shit job far longer than I anticipated. Everyone looked at me like human garbage. I was working with kids, who were allowed to physically abuse us without consequence because of the politics between parents and administration. I finally quit to substitute teach, I still make nothing, and now most people I know just consider me "unemployed" because it's basically freelancing rather than part time.  I'm belittled by everyone, expected to be their grunt due to my status. My parents ignore my existence because my older sister, a bigger fuck up by all accounts, needs their attention and my younger brother is graduating law school so I'm an embarrassment.  I don't see a therapist because I can't afford it (freelancers don't get health insurance, so I'm also on medicaid.. medicare? I'm also ashamed of that). I've stopped seeing my college friends the once or twice a year we previously managed.  They all look down on me as well. Hell, a year ago my friend had me submit my resume for an office assistant position at her company. She instead showed it to a hiring manager friend of hers without my knowledge and berated me about the weaknesses they pointed out, then didn't show her boss. Another friend, whose essays for grad school I edited, recently told me they think it's admirable I don't complain a lot despite "where your life is."   I've been suicidal in the past but ironically not now. It's like my self hate is finally mirrored by the outside world. I am waiting to die, however. Even if I somehow get a 40k job (I'm making less than OP right now) I'll just be staring down my student loan debt forever. [end]
[start] I don't judge you and I too think minimum wage should be raised.  You have come far and you sound like an incredibly hard working and tough guy. You have all my respect and I sincerely hope for you that it will become better. The emotions you feel, the thoughts you have, that is perfectly normal and it is okay that you think and feel this way. Don't let that get in your way too much and more importantly stay strong.  Please stay optimistic even in times that are especially hard. It could all change one day, you never know. Treat yourself as well as you can, no one needs your own love more than you do. You are worthy of love.  Stay strong. Make the best out of it. Accept your situation, stay optimistic against all odds and stay strong. Also, stay with us. We are all humans and we all deserve the same, love and respect. Some people might have forgotten this but that doesn't make it any different.  I view you highly for giving the world your best daily. It is okay to cry and you have been in difficult situations over the years. This can wear us all down but with these challenges, you will grow stronger, you learn how to overcome them, even if that means crying and feeling miserable. After all, these things pass and thibgs will change. Everything changes all the time, we often fail to notice and it is impossible to know in which way things will change.  Appreciate the smaller things in life, every morning, every second, you find yourself to be alive, you find yourself to be breathing. This too will change one day but until then you can experience what it means to be alive.  Keep up your good work. You are worthy of love, especially your own. You are the person that needs your own love the most. Treat yourself well, you deserve it. May you live a happy and peaceful life and may you be free of suffering.  [end]
[start] I dropped out of hs one week into my senior year and moved across the country to be with a girl and her daughter. I've learned, fuck other people. I don't have what I need to go to college, I work a low wage job (~$500/mo). Honestly, if someone else has a problem with you, it's their problem not yours. All my bills are paid, though I am still poor considering I'm the only one with an income and bills still add up to ~$350.  Honestly, I do not support raising minimum wage. I support companies not being greedy. I mean seriously, what's going to happen when minimum wage is $20/hr? Things are going to cost more. USD will be worth less. I don't have facts or actual sources but this is what I've noticed growing up.   I see people younger than me "living it up" making it big. Usually these people are streamers (AS IF THATS A REAL JOB!). Same with Esports.. "congratulations you're pretty good at playing games"  I know I don't make much but I'm not greedy. Rich people are greedy, snobby and most will turn their nose in the presence of someone who is less off than they are. I know for a fact that every single person that has been lived, or will be born, will not be any more valuable than their neighbor.   All I'm saying is, don't feel like shit because someone says you are shit. Words mean shit. Life is beautiful. I know I've said a lot here and not all of it makes sense. I'm in the same boat you are, only with less income. I'm trying to tell you that you are an amazing person. To live so long without dying.   Remember, YOU ARE IMPORTANT. YOU ARE NEEDED. YOU ARE LOVED. EVEN IF YOU DON'T SEE IT. There's so much going on in the world sometimes we forget to take a step back and look at where we are now. For me, that's living in poor people housing as a poor person coming from a family with money. Sorry for saying so much here.  [end]
[start] Man, fuck that lady.  [end]
[start] I see you and you are a hero to the under dog.  [end]
[start] There is dignity in labor. People who don't realize that are trash.  Honestly your boss being opposed to the minimum wage increase sounds like classic republican talking points unfortunately.  [end]
[start] I know I’m super late to the party but I hope you see this.  Someone I greatly admire taught me that it’s not about what you do for a job, or how much you have, or who you know, it’s how you care for others that makes you a remarkable person.  That lesson saved my life. [end]
[start] I can relate to this 100%. It sounds a lot like my life. Same age, work for Uber full time, best friend since the age of 5 died recently, and my life by and large is really depressing. No relationship with my parents who have a history of substance abuse (I do too, since I was 12). I have no college degree but have been paying for part time school for four years. I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to make ends meet and go to school. I have no social life whatsoever and no friends left, especially considering my unpopular political views. We may not be exactly in the same boat, but the one thing that did change my life recently is working out and it might work for you too. You’ll be amazed at how well you’ll feel if you stick with it only 3 times a week. I’m getting into bodybuilding and have done it consistently for the past four months and I’m not stressed or sad like I used to be. My testosterone levels have improved and things that used to bother me no longer do. I know people’s words of encouragement can seem a bit misguided and off-putting sometimes, but I can assure you that if you get through the challenge of working out and eating well consistently, you’ll feel like a million bucks. I’m never going back to my old ways. I hope you can derive some value from what I’ve written and I wish you the best of luck.  [end]
[start] I Want to hug you! [end]
[start] I just read this in another sub:  My self worth is not tied to my identity.  My identity will change many times in my life.  However my self worth should never change.  &#x200B; [end]
[start] Fuck America is so broken.  I'm sorry. [end]
[start] I don't usually comment on these threads.   I have a lot of respect for the hustle. I have a lot of respect for work ethic and character. I think most people in the world that *matter* feel the same. You're a goddamn rock OP and the world is a worse place if someone like you isn't in it.  Godspeed. [end]
[start] Bro, this resonated with me.   “It’s not about what you, it’s about HOW you do it.” [end]
[start] youve worked hard and thats all that matters. youre a beast damn [end]
[start] I'm proud of you.  [end]
[start] Your not a loser you haven't caught a good break in a long time I really hope it's around the corner waiting for you,  [end]
[start] Well... internet stranger.  You are the type of responsible hardworker I would want my son to be.  That is how I see you.  It isn't where we start or where we are that matters most... it's where we wind up. [end]
[start] Sounds like a meme, but its capitalism that does this to us. For example, most economists will tell you that a measure of unemployment is pivotal in a healthy society  to ensure labour costs don't raise above a viable level for production costs. So basically, the unemployed are a necessary part of society, however you will never hear anyone refer to them as anything other than lazy leaches.  We exist in a societal model that denies success to the vast majority of us, then punishes us for it. Don't buy into the bullshit.   1. I have anxiety problems too, and I know it isn't easy, but confidence is key in living a free life. Are you capable? Smart? Are you a potent person who can get things done? The answer is yes. This means you will always be able to find a way to pay the bills, eat and sleep. Which means you need to lose the stress around your job. It isn't worth stress. Get the calm app, and start practicing mindfulness and meditation when you feel stress coming on. This will allow you to enjoy what happens  outside of work.  2. Make the most of your life. You mostly don't need money to be happy, healthy, and feel accomplishment. Exercise is free, most towns have libraries, and there are a range of free things you can do and learn, like a new language, that will give you a meaningful goal to work towards. Having this in your life will remind you that your worth does not come from your paycheck. Your social  value is not defined by what you can afford to buy, and anyone who believes that it is, is an insecure little baby, who likely has the insight and maturity of a fucking urinal cake.   3. Meet different  kinds of people. It sounds like some of the people you are interacting with are fucking toxic. I'm 30, relatively successful now, but certainly not always. I think I used to be trapped in that same headspace of judging peoples worth by their job, and at the time I ... was not worth much. I remember visiting my cousin once in a different town, and meeting people who were doing all this amazing stuff, volunteering for troubled children's programs, youth activism, youth ministers, creating web series on zero budget etc. When I asked people what they did, this is what they told me. When I asked how they  paid rent they would say, "i work at a pizza place" or "i collect unemployment". I was honestly so impressed, and it changed my life. Nobody worth their own spit could say these amazing people  weren't adding value to society. This is when I started feeling ok about myself, which ultimately led to me being happier and more successful anyway.  Will this work for you? Who knows? But you are worth the effort. [end]
[start] such a fake, over exxagerated load of garbage. "Nobody wants to associate with someone in their mid 20s who doesn't make more than 30k."  Top ten braindead statements of 2018, congrats [end]
[start] This made me tear up. I don’t share your experience, not in the slightest. So I can’t imagine what it would be like to be in your situation. I am 23, and go through small bouts of unhappiness in my job, even though it pays well and I feel like I am a part an important functional group in my company. I always think about people who make less money than me, especially in my city, which has one of the highest costs of living in the United States. I make enough to live on my own, make payments on my new(ish) car and student loans, all while saving some money, the basics. I don’t know how they do it, or how they can do it. I struggle waking up just to go to my job sometimes, even though I consider a relatively low stress job. I have tremendous respect for people that work those low wage, high stress jobs, jobs that I could only last in for 3 months after I graduated high school. But I was lucky enough to get into a good, nearby school and graduate with a moderately low debt in student loans, and even if that didn’t pan out my family would be able to support me through it financially.   I often have to make calls to a help desk, and most often the person on the other line has a good front and is pleasant to speak with. It escapes me to see how they can have such a good attitude when all they do is solve the problems of angry clients all day.   I hope you enjoyed your McFlurry and show, I love how such little moments of comfort like that can take the edge off momentarily. For me, it’s ordering a Dominoes Pizza, a beer and watching The Office or Rick and Morty on a loop. [end]
[start] As a fellow couch sleeper let me say, you can do it!i believe in Santa Claus and I believe in you.  [end]
[start] Your boss is wrong. That's not how most people feel and she needs to go educate herself about how poverty and our society works. [end]
[start] Are you not a working class hero?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMewtlmkV6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMewtlmkV6c) [end]
[start] I don’t think you’re a loser for working a minimum wage job.  You’re being made tougher, and you will be better for it later.   This situation won’t be you for forever. Hang on a little longer, work a little longer, and fight a little longer.    [end]
[start] You're not a loser, you're boss is a prejudiced peice of shit for looking down her nose at low-wage earners. [end]
[start] Thank-you for your story. A caveat though on moving to Canada - medications aren’t paid for here. But the extra insurance is roughly $100-200 a month to get them covered. If a company denies you here (which shouldn’t be employer), then look for the government plans. Just start with the government plans. Many  provinces also have a Mac annually - paid $4000k on med supplies and drugs? Rest of the year is on the government. Sounds high but I hear in the USA it can be much more.  [end]
[start] I don’t think you’re a loser. You’re working so damn hard and honestly the system is not working in our favor. It’s several times harder today to buy a house and live a “middle class” lifestyle than it was for our parents or grandparents. Please keep your chin up. I admire your strength and work ethic. Sending you love and hugs, i believe in you  [end]
[start] Get a new therapist. Why the FUCK is she talking about a political issue, and especially disagreeing with one that directly applies to your situation???  Sorry for what you are going through. Try imagine having the same setup, but with many more years under your belt. You have plenty of time to sort things out- it can't rain forever [end]
[start] You work much harder than your leech boss [end]
[start] Wow, Im amazed, proud of you, and humbled myself. Im 23 and doing well given my circumstances and what Ive had to overcome, but you are on a whole other level. I respect you, and I truly believe that delayed gratification is the only way out of money traps.   If you want a friend, someone to believe in you, or someone to talk things over with, i would gladly make myself available to you. Ive been told im a good listener [end]
[start] Man, I feel you completely, even though I had some disimularities,  I am right there with you. The best thing is you do have a supportive family.  I was always told by my father I would turn out to be a nothing. And yep that's how it turned out, no thanks to him. I had to start at young age also due to having to move out, due to my fathers mental and physical abuse. After all that, I am in line with you. It's been a major struggle for me, yes I do wanna die, yes I do not know what fun is, and yes i love mcflurries. If you ever need to talk feel free to hit me up. [end]
[start] While my dad also works a call center, he's a piece of shit because of how he's treated me and my ma both previously and recently.  [end]
[start] I love you man xx [end]
[start] I know how you feel because I've been there. I worked in a call center for many years and had a pretty much similar reaction to yours. I felt like a zombie day in and day out like my life can't change or be anything different.   You can make more than 45k as long as you have the will and knowledge and skills. Going to school helps 100000% just take your time with it if you don't want to feel rushed. Aim for your bachelor's eventually. Major in something business related as it's versatile.   There's more to life than a call center. I understand it's comfortable but life is better when you become above it. It might even help moving to a different city. I'm not sure where you live and how the opportunities are but I'd recommend in to moving and discovering yourself away from certain poisonous scenarios. There's a lot I can talk to you about, feel free to dm me if you want. Also I'm 35 just to give you perspective. So it's not that long ago where I felt in your shoes.  [end]
[start] Have you thought about moving somewhere with a lower cost of living? I afford a 2 bedroom apartment on a $9/hr job working part time hours while going to school where I live. You won’t be rich but you also won’t have to work 50 hours a week just for rent money.  [end]
[start] Anyone who has a job and is able to keep said job for a year or more with consistency is not a loser. Regardless of your age. There are a lot of people who are disabled and can’t work and wish they could, or even worse people who won’t work a job that they think is “below” them because of their pride or are just flat out unreliable and have no work ethic. Right now I’m just working a part-time minimum wage job at a dry cleaners and going to school part time to finish my degree. Most people my age have already started their careers (I’m 23) but I’m still fucking proud of myself because a year ago I was not working at all, hadn’t been able to hold a job for more than short periods of time due to my alcoholism. So for me to even have a job and be able to go to work feels awesome. Even if I make shit money and still live with my mom, I feel fortunate to be able to work. Sitting at home all day fucking sucks, and I have a lot more respect for people who work minimum wage than people who simply refuse to work at all.   People throw around the word loser all too often. It’s an insult that cuts deep because no one wants to look at themselves in that light and we all know when we aren’t meeting society, or our own standards for ourselves. So as long as you don’t believe you are a loser, then you’re not, regardless of what people say.  [end]
[start] You are not a loser, actually quite the opposite. I don't think i would have had the determination to get out of poverty and keep going, you are strong. [end]
[start] Yeah, people who had a pretty clear shot to a comfortable life don't have any clue what the struggle can be like, whether it's from financial hardship, health problems, or simply bad luck.       Also, one thing I realize now (I'm 37) is that being in a low wage area for too long puts you in proximity to and in the mindset of mostly the kind of people who don't know how to get out of it, either. Opportunities often come up from knowing the right person at the right time, plus having the skills to win the job.  [end]
[start] Depression is a fucked up beast that constantly tells you you aren’t good enough, even though you are. There are certainly people out there who look down on the working class, but that’s nothing compared to the voice in your head telling you that you don’t measure up. I’m 38 years old, have been working since I was 15, and only several years ago did I get to the point that I could pay my bills on time. There are more people out there like you than you think, so please don’t feel alone. I’m glad you are seeing a therapist, but your suicidal thoughts concern me. I too was suicidal for most of my life and it wasn’t until I went on antidepressants that I realized how I had been feeling was NOT normal. Have you talked to your doctor about possibly trying an SSRI to treat your depression? I only bring it up because they truly changed my life. [end]
[start] I think you are getting responses kinda back and fourth about that the world isn’t just judging people or vice versa. I have my own opinion on that and iI think it doesn’t contribute to anything, so I’m gonna keep it to myself.   What I can say is, that people will always judge, wether it’s conscious or not. It’s a fact and an ugly part of the world but here we go. The only thing that actually matters is, how you feel about yourself. I mean of course I feel like shit when I think about all the stuff people say or I think they would say. So I’m not talking about the shame you feel but truly, truly how you think about the things your did in your life. Sacrifices you mentioned, all these years in situations no one ants to be in. You say you are proud, and hell I’m proud of you, a stranger when I read what you have to put in for everything you have right now.   Feeling proyd of yourself isn’t gonna take the shame and anger away. It really doesn’t. You have to be conscious about the fact, that the world is indeed unfair. It will never be just. And oh boy isn’t it god or some cosmic power but the people who live in it that make it worse. Kinda missing my point but ehat I want to say is, that you yourself are making a diference in trying, relly fricking trying to not fall for the things that have been put in your way.   That’s pretty much all I can say, because I don’t have much to offer myself. But know that I’m so fucking proud of you.  I think almost all of us are. [end]
[start] I see you as the best kind of person. You’re one who has empathy and understanding.  I’ve been there. I was a student, then a graduate student for many years. No dates. No fun. No money. Just work and school. I’m middle aged now and have nothing in the bank, but I am wealthy in family and friends. I’m finally done with school and have a job. Fixing years of missed payments. I wish you the best.  [end]
[start] Man I’m 27 and make shit for wages. Luckily my parents help me out a lot otherwise I’d be in a lot worse position. They pay for college for me so I can hopefully get a nice career but what if they didn’t? I’d literally be stuck. You don’t have anything to be ashamed of. A lot of us millennials are in the same position as you. It’s damn near impossible to move up the social ladder without some kind of outside help.  [end]
[start] Your life sounds surprisingly similar to my own. Just know your not alone in having these feelings. I take solace knowing that one day this will all be over. To be honest, it's my fear of what comes after that drives me to keep on keeping on day after day. Maybe you feel that way too. [end]
[start] Your bosses opinions hinges on the idea that there are “lesser” people who simply don’t deserve decent pay. Nobody “chooses” to be less intelligent or capable or wants to settle for less.   I’d love to see how your bosses’ business would survive if all the minimum wage workers were more capable and started businesses of their own and earned just as much. The problem is, the amount of extra effort your boss puts in isn’t parallel to the money they make. Putting in extra effort should earn extra money. But what constitutes as extra effort and sacrifice? The economy needs those minimum wage employees right now, and the day day it doesn’t is also the days that it doesn’t need CEOs. [end]
[start] I don't usually comment on reddit but I felt had to on this. I think you and every person who works on minimum wage should be proud of themselves. Not just because you guys do the real work but because you choose to earn an honest and sincere living. You don't choose to make money by cheating, lying or harming people. But you choose to make money by helping people, in ways we can't help ourselves. You sir/mam deserve way more respect and wage than you get.  [end]
[start] Are you physically fit/ near Houston? Might have an in for you at a business I helped start   We exclusively employ non-degenerates so youve got that going for you already  &#x200B; [end]
[start] I'm really concerned with the situation of the US proletariat. It seems that you guys live like Stone age people, with a bit more fancy clothes.   I'm sorry to say that, but it's true. You should leave this shitty country and come in Europe, even if you won't win much more at least there is less ultra capitalist dickhead for whom only the money have value.  Really, it's astonishing, how much of a hassle the life of the majority of USA people is. It's a tragedy.   I feel you man, believe me, and I really would love to do anything for you. Come in France, yes this Communist full-of-arabs country, where at least people still have a soul. Where you have health care, a pay by the state when you're unemployed, and a pay to help you renting a house too. Where everything is not about how much a slave you are. When everything is not superficial yet.   I truly believe what I say, it's horrific to see this kind of mind setup where everything is about money.   The fact is this reflect the class struggle  and not the obsession of money. But you American really seems to find it hard to believe, when your very own elite say there is a class struggle.   https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2fblogs%2fplum-line%2fpost%2ftheres-been-class-warfare-for-the-last-20-years-and-my-class-has-won%2f2011%2f03%2f03%2fgIQApaFbAL_blog.html%3futm_term%3d.7327aad79763&utm_term=.7327aad79763   You guys should come political refugees here in France, for real.  [end]
[start] There’s million or more people out there that feel just like this. It’s hard to speak up when you’re ashamed of your lot in life. Putting words to this and sharing them takes courage. Minimum wage should be just that; the minimum required to support yourself through the month. This is not just about wages but also about restoring some amount of dignity to the lower class. Would also make working a minimum wage job a viable option to working the black market via stolen goods, drug sales or pimping to make ends meet.  [end]
[start] Good job, respect  .  [end]
[start] I feel proud of you.  [end]
[start] You worked your ass off. Be proud of yourself. You could’ve chosen the easy way, but you didn’t. You’re very strong and I really believe some day all this pain will turn into a advantage for you. You’re worth much more than these people looking down on you. You know life and not just the „good life“.  Im really impressed by you and your story. Please stay strong no matter what !  [end]
[start] Literal years of constant work should be earning you mad respect (like it has in my eyes). [end]
[start] How your boss got hired is honestly confusing. Being able to help out your staff is essential and she is obviously more concerned about herself in comparison to others.  I hope this will all get better for you mate, you deserve it considering how far your willing to go to have a better life. [end]
[start] Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Keep at it! [end]
[start] In every sense of the word, you’re a warrior. Thank you for sharing, OP. Thank you so much.  [end]
[start] maybe I'm not understanding everything properly, but why would working in a call center mean you're a loser?  [end]
[start] It is pretty fucked up how people treat our generation. I'm a college educated janitor/maintenance guy making LESS than 30k, living check to check at 33 years old. Did I make bad choices in life? Maybe. I spent most of my early 20s working my ass off to support a live-in girlfriend who refused to work. Then right as I was old enough to get financial aid for school, my father took to the sick bed and needed care. There went another year. By the time I realized that I've spent my most important years of my life being charitable and not working on "me" - I'm in my 30s. I'm a loser, and despite trying to be kind and doing the right thing, I'm that burnout who "didn't do so well". It doesn't count that I'm a published and adapted playwright, have a degree, played in a band that made it on the radio, etc. I feel I have accomplished so much compared to a lot of people I know, despite having a "late start". I just live in a time where nobody wants to hire someone with a broken ambition. I'll be lucky if I ever end up financially secure and happy. My retirement plan isn't looking good right now, and it looks like a noose will be more reasonable than a 401k [end]
[start] People who disrespect your hustle are NOT worth it. Don’t let these people’s narrow-minded opinions hold any value in your life. Your boss clearly doesn’t understand what it’s like to have to hustle for every dollar.   It’s unfortunate that we don’t hold wage workers at a higher esteem since they are really out here doing the toughest work for unfair pay. Hopefully your state and our country (assuming you’re in the U.S.) gets their shit together and raises the minimum wage to a fair living-wage standard.    Also: Remember that depression warps your perception of yourself. Think about how hard you’ve worked to get to where you are—be proud!!   If you translate the skills you’ve acquired into a solid resume, you could try to find another job within the company (or outside) that pays a little more and where the culture is more accepting of all their employees. [end]
[start] I worked minimum wage for the majority of my life. In and out of community college. I ultimately took the dive and went full student loans to get a degree. I'm now making double to triple what I made working minimum wage.  I say this not to say school is the answer, but learning skills is incredibly important. You are never too old to go back to school or, arguably more beneficial, a trade school. The only way you can move up is by making yourself marketable, and that's either through being lucky/knowing someone and starting high, or a degree/certificate.  But don't stop. You are the only person that can push yourself out of minimum wage. Your manager is proof it isn't going to come from someone else. [end]
[start] You are a valuable person. If you are a good person who the fuck cares if you work at a call center working minimum wage? I’d rather be your friend than friends with a millionaire making money off scamming people or some person that only has money because their parents made that money and basically handed them the business with no effort from their part. Look at kim kardashian. She has money and luxuries but it stems from taking a big black dick on video. No talent. No real work ethic needed. Don’t beat yourself up over it. If you ever need to talk I’m here to listen.  [end]
[start] 31 here and close to the same situation. Personally I’ve lost hope of ever finding anything that will pay me more then $30k a year, even with a degree. Thankfully guns aren’t that expensive.  [end]
[start] Hey pal, I really respect you for working so hard. My work ethic has always been terrible, and as a result I am now over 200k in debt. So while you may not be happy with where you’re at, at least you’re debt free, and you’ve proven you can work harder than most! I hope life opens the doors you deserve in the near future. [end]
[start] This is a clear cut case for /r/LateStageCapitalism  [end]
[start] American society is extremely fucked up in that people work to keep the young and the poor down rather than uplifting themselves and others.    It's the 21st century and we don't even have universal healthcare FFS.  Understand that poverty in an extremely wealthy late capitalist country is to a large extent socially created violence to keep people down and out.    It's not a reflection of your character, and you should be very proud of yourself for coming as far as you have.  Hell, I'm proud of you and I don't even know you.     [end]
[start] Also I’d like to add that I have much more respect for you than a friend of mine. About 2 yrs ago she quit her job in retail (only job she’d ever worked at for 8 yrs) and she took her time looking for a job. She didn’t have anything other than retail experience and her time at her first job, when they tried to give her a promotion she denied them because “the pay wasn’t enough” or “she didn’t want to do that” or “didn’t want to stay late because that manager position required leaving the store last”.  I’d helped her with her resume and even looking for job postings for about a month but more than half of them she wouldn’t apply to because she wanted a “easy office” job. She could’ve probably easily gotten hired at many places and worked her way up but she didn’t want to do it. She wanted to go straight into a good paying desk job. Eventually I gave up on helping her and after some months of no luck, she ended up working at a grocery store on minimum wage. Not surprisingly they wouldn’t hire her full time because her work ethic wasn’t really there and in my opinion, based on what she would tell me, she would put minimal effort into customer service and taking care of her stocking zone. When asked to stay late she’s complain or throw a fit if she had to work more than 5 days in a row. I worked 7 days a week for about 5 years straight 10+hrs at a time sometimes at my family business busting my butt and she dared complain when she wouldn’t have a weekend off or had to work because someone was sick and her week was a 6+ day week. Now I’m pissed off remembering.  [end]
[start] I just read your story - and it pains me to hear how people treat you based on your job... for me it sounds like your “superior” is just a boss not a leader how on earth can she say that about the minimum wagers 🤦🏻‍♂️  I really hope the best for you in the future cause I feel I have been walking in your shoes when I was younger and I know the future will be better  I still don’t have that much contact with either family nor friends but in the last couple of years that has been my own decision and it doesn’t pains me anymore I have a good job with good coworkers my superiors respect me but it took me long time to end up “on this shelf” Lastly I will say please don’t give a flying fxxk about what people think about your job you are doing a fxxking good job I have never met you but I all ready respect you keep on going mate  [end]
[start] That must feel terrible, I hope it will be better in the future.. P.s Sorry to ask but is 30k the minimum wage?  I'm from the Netherlands, have a nice job and make about 31k a year? Just wondering how that works because I'm not doing bad financially at all. [end]
[start] When I was in my 30s, I made a little more than minimum wage and struggled financially.  Rarely went on dates and barely had fun. Meditation helped a lot. It is cheap to learn and had a major impact on my mental health.   Now I am in my 50s, have a great relationship,  travel, and make over 100k. I attribute it to finding my passion and living it.  Sure, I work 80 hours a week,  but I love what I do,  get 4 weeks paid vacation, and make great money. I believe the meditation helped me understand myself and stop sabotaging my opportunities.   Good luck!  [end]
[start] I don't give a shit what it is you do for a job, you get up every single day and you go out there and do the best you can, you are nothing short of a role model.  Just because you're not as far along some people are or you're not as far along as where you want to be, doesn't mean that there isn't someone that still looks up to you for what you've come through.  In fact, you're only 30,  God damn if you only knew how young that was you would realize how much time you have!! [end]
[start] You're not a loser. It seems you're playing in hard mode, though. [end]
[start] You're not a loser. It seems like you're playing in hard mode, though. [end]
[start] Don't put so much stock into what people say. People's opinions reveal more about themselves than the people they are speaking about. I love the honesty in your story. The definition of a successful person is someone who is working towards an idealistic goal. I wish there were more people like you. [end]
[start] OP hit me right in the feels. This is my life too. [end]
[start] I'm incredibly proud of you.  I was essentially disabled with a very painful illness throughout my entire 20s, but I beat it. I really felt like no one who I met would understand me or appreciate how hard it was for me to reach what they considered the baseline of their life. I did meet a lot of people who didn't understand but I met a lot of people who wanted to understand. They're out there and their opinions are the only ones you should take to heart.  Of course that only works with friends and unfortunately we can't pick our bosses. I don't have a lot of job and boss experience but I can say this: their authority over you at work doesn't make their opinion on this more important. They're just one person like either of us, even though they often have control over many people. This is maybe another topic for another thread but I hope someday we can level these kinds of power imbalances through socialism. Being blind to the suffering you've described helps people get promoted to boss, since they'll represent the owners on issues like worker wages. That this blindness to the truth of life is treated as a strength and not a weakness is proof that our system is unjust.  So many of the things in your post remind me of the situation my girlfriend is in now as well. Our mutual ability to empathize has really brought us together, and I bet you've learned that skill too.  [end]
[start] once you factor in student debt in the US you aren't as far behind as you might think. [end]
[start] OP, as someone younger than you, I can say that you are a new person I look up to. You are everything a human aspires too be. You are determined, empathic, loyal, and even genuine, honest, person. I hate when we all bash others for having certain jobs. We all do things we don’t like, but sometimes they are necessary. So thank you for working hard. :) You’ve inspired me to be as hardworking as you. [end]
[start] You are a warrior, she can’t say that stuff [end]
[start] I feel like I can relate a bit to this. I'm in my late 30s working in a call center making a little over minimum wage. Most of my friends are gone doing their own thing. I had a very close friend for 5+ years and then she purposely hurt me, so I walked away from one of the best friends I've ever had. I do have an ex with two kids and they're the center of my world. I live paycheck to paycheck, having to time out making rent/electric/car payments each month so I don't overdraft. I broke down about a week ago thinking "this isn't how its supposed to be. I shouldn't be working full time, spending every bit of time away from work with the kids doing what's "right" as a father and still be broke as shit." I'm trying to figure out what changes I can make to get out of this funk. Keep at it, man. Don't give up.  [end]
[start] I know this is so late you may never read it, OP, but I want to say I am proud of you. Life does not go smoothly for so many wonderful prople, but how you keep getting up every day and keep fighting is an inspiration to me. I've been homeless as well but I was always lucky enough to have family and friends give me a place to stay. I recently bought my first home. It's small but I can afford it. And I too hope to find a new job that pays a little more so I can begin saving again. I'm rooting for you! [end]
[start] I would challenge your sense of self worth and wonder how much it based on others opinions. You seem to be missing that sense of class entitlement that the others whom you have described have. Whether they know it or not, they want to keep you in your place. They are profiting on you.  I also started my adult life in poverty, worked at a call center for several years and struggled for most of my 20's. Additionally, I went to an overpriced for-profit college, which has been shut down by the federal government for predatory lending and dismal job placement. After graduation left me 130k in debt AND without the qualifications to find work in my chosen field.  But here's the thing, I'm not going to accept the class system that I entered into. I've been very dedicated towards moving into my chosen career, so I practice at night and on the weekends, research the topics, go to meetings around town, networking. A few years ago, I found internship for my dream job, a few months in, I demanded a reasonable wage, year later I demanded a more reasonable raise , a year after that I was hired as a staff member. Now I'm handling projects solo, being asked for my opinions on other people's work and making decisions for the studio. I've also decided to move on to another studio more deserving of my time and skills. when the time is right.  The way you describe youraelf, sounds like you are persistent and have the tenacity and efficacy to get where you need to be.  What about your belief? Do you believe that you deserve to make a decent income, that you deserve leisure time, that you deserve to be happy and close to people that respect what you have to offer and look up to you?   A lot of people never even have to ask themselves about their worth. They were just born into it. They have always been positioned for middle class success. Their work ethic also sucks. [end]
[start] You're definitely not a loser, bro. This hurts me because i know exactly how you feel. I lost my best friend to suicide 4 years ago, I couldnt find a "career", I went to vocational school to learn when I could, I could not keep a girlfriend (I was looking for love in bars, huge mistake) and i was generally lost in life up until very recently.   I now have a fiance of 2 years, a 1 1/2 old little boy, I volunteer at the fire dept. and I just started a career in law enforcement.   What im getting at here is shit just takes time for most of us. For the depression I would take up a combat sport like boxing or BJJ, combat sports melt the stress of life away and belonging to something bigger then yourself gives meaning. This is coming from personal experience.  Take care of yourself, my dude. [end]
[start] Also, keep in mind that the majority of our generation is eyeballs deep in debt.  A prestigious degree, new car, fancy house, etc.  All adds to overwhelming debt and a superficial appearance of success.  Anyone who would judge you is most likely projecting their own insecurities.    If you have little to no debt, you're ahead of the game at 30.  Debt makes/keeps you a slave.  [end]
[start] I've been looking through the comments for the past ten minutes or so... OP, this post couldn't have been more properly times in my life than right now. I'm in my mid 20s, working temp jobs because no matter how many applications I submit or check up on, I've never gotten a job through them.  I quit school because of being diagnosed with ADD, learning why I took 9 hours to do what others do in 3, and losing hope that I would ever finish and graduate after 6 years of "education." Two days ago I just had a mental breakdown about work, money, moving out of my parents house for the third time, and working on my dreams at the same time.   I felt childish, immature, even just flat out wrong to want to do what Ive always wanted to when I had to make so much money.  I feel like people judge me for being a temp, making minimum wage without guarantee of having a regular job.  I can't make plans, because my job isn't my job, it's someone else's they let me do and can get rid of me whenever they want. I think the best word to describe that feeling is demeaning, and yes your boss was in the wrong to say anything like that. Your post made me really happy, not because is all the hardship you've experienced, but because I see someone else with similar experiences getting through them and becoming better by them. So uh, if you read this, thanks.  PS. I have no idea how to do coding whatsoever, but I've always wanted to do front desk positions.  Where do you learn and get certified for that? [end]
[start] I am college educated and work in a call center for a hospital. I see nurses getting harassed by patients on the phone all the time, too... so it's not about YOU, it's about the harasser being a complete POS. Your job is invaluable and it requires a high level of communication skills that many people do not posses or have to learn. You also need to be a problem solver and know about human behavior.  Companies wouldn't be able to survive without us and we DO help people.   Your job is also not who you are. Many of my coworkers define themselves by what they do. They rescue animals, travel around the world (save up!) Or play sports or do acting, etc.   I know it can suck, I get down on myself about my job too. I personally am going back to school for dental hygiene because I felt ashamed for a long time as my family are all professionals. I think a lot about how much it's going to suck going I  to student debt and be less well off as when I had my call center job. The freedom to leave work at the office and the ability to make a decent living without a masters degree.   [end]
[start] Op, have you considered trying sales? It’s basically a very similar job where you have to make phone calls all day and email, but you can make a lot more money. You might want to look into it. Being an SDR is pretty great. B2B sales. [end]
[start] Your therapist shouldn’t make comments like that. That’s unprofessional and frankly disturbing. I’d find a new one ASAP. I, personally, would leave her a bad Yelp review indicating she is classist, but that’s up to you. She’s supposed to be helping you.  [end]
[start] There is no shame in having a minimum wage job. Everyone has their own lives and battles, age is not a measurement for accomplishment. The greed of the US government and big corporations is the root of the problem. There are plenty developed countries having similar or lower average income, yet not going bankrupted over a medical bill. Lack of social benefits is making it difficult for the younger generations to be independent in the US, if not impossible. It seems most of the time, people forget minimum wage workers are trying to survive and without them, there wouldn’t be “affordable” services available. The US is built by many immigrants who were minimum wage workers, the kind of hardworking people your boss seems to be looking down on. I’m sorry what she says hurt you. [end]
[start] Man mad respect, I'm sure you've worked much harder and have much more discipline than your boss. I just don't understand how people have this view that what your job title is/how much you get paid = your worth as a human being. They don't understand the hustle, and even if you know that it's not a measure of your worth or mean anything about who you are as a person, it still gets to you. But also know there are plenty, possibly more, that believe your an incredibly hard-working person that has shown dedication, resilience, courage, and discipline. It may not feel like that, I just wanted to tell you that's what I got and thought of about you when reading your post. Best of luck OP [end]
[start] > She said that she didn't believe in raising the minimum wage because she  thought that people who make that much don't believe in bettering their  lives or want to "be" anything. The "minimum," she said, should be  little enough that people feel ashamed to work that job, and that the  "better" people won't be able to tolerate the shame for more than a year  before looking for a "real" job.   What a brainwashed horrible noob of life CUNT! I applaud you for putting up with that, I would have put her in her place and walked the fuck out of there after setting her up if I had to put up with that type of talk for too long. You have patience and keep doing what makes you sane. People are shitty overall, a lot have it all given to them and then these are the same people going around taking away from people in your situation. They want to take away from you because they know deep down inside you are stronger than they will ever be. Material things are things that end up in trash cans but to be able to hold it down when you have a shit hand is how you are a pro at life. I grew up with many people like that, they had trust funds, never had to work in highschool, were never pressured to work in high school and then they would brag about their "hard work" because they used mom and dads money to seed some weed sales. The level of dishonest and brutal asinine attitude of a person to go and take away from someone they called their friend because they had more "power" due to someone handing them life, is the type of person I would never ever cry over if they ended up in the worst and most brutal of horrific situations. Life isn't easy, don't make worse for someone else because you are an overly entitled privileged shit bag. The tables always turn and some people never forget the times when they got screwed over, and by whom.   &#x200B; [end]
[start] If you are making an honest living you truly are deserving of all the respect that comes to you in the same way that it does for any other profession. Just because you make minimum wage doesn't reflect your character the fact that you worked hard is what defines your character.  [end]
[start] I'm with you comrade. I'm also a 30 year old who never went to college, and has had to work hard their whole life. Then people who don't know your struggle want to shit on you, like you're not working your ass off.   That minimum wage stuff is the same crock of shit that people who have never been actually poor always push. Block it out. They've got to shift the blame so they can pretend that our economic system allows for everyone to become doctors and lawyers, and that all the other "low level" jobs will magically still get done somehow.   Regardless, you have my sympathy and solidarity!  [end]
[start] I agree with your boss, but disagree about the healthcare too. She can shell out the cash if she needs it so bad. [end]
[start] Thank you so much for sharing. You are a very strong person and I am in awe of your perseverance. All the best! [end]
[start] Get your CDL and be a truck driver. You'll never not have decent income. I promise :) [end]
[start] The losers are the other people. [end]
[start] You are the epitome of my less hustle more muscle phrase. Keep at it, I am not where I want to be either. Reading your story makes me think of my struggles, with jobs as well. I let a career job to help a buddy run a business. I only had Christmas off for 5 years straight, the business came first. I invested a lot of my own money all my time, & the pay I got was less then 9:30 an hour with how much I worked. Wer had A big falling out, I feel I wasted 5 yrs, lost a best friend, my cat passed that I know if I had better job I could've paid for treatment, lost all my money. I had to do a call center job as well. First time I ever did this, I an usually the first in & always last to leave. I see my coworkers leave to go to the bar, some owe me money yet on their fb they are going out to eat with friends. I get home & am alone(still have one cat). I've been thinking I'm a loser (couple yrs older than you) I don't date, I don't like to go out to spend money, rather keep it. The only different is most younger coworkers think I am a loser, the older ones think I'm a machine with how much I work. I want more than this situation I am stuck in. I can tell you do as well. The best compliment I got recently is "you are always working hard!" I want so much more....& more muscle less hustle is my motto. We will both be successful keep it up!!! I believe in you!!! [end]
[start] OP it sounds to me like you are doing great. If every day is a fight and you refuse to tap out then you are a warrior and you should be proud. I don't find  lot of respect for those who validate themselves through the lens of a job or a bank balance, I respect people who do what they have to and do it as well as they can.  Keep pushing on OP. There are different kinds of greatness and they don't all manifest in the ways that the world tells you they do. [end]
[start] Where do you live obviously 30k isnt amazing anywhere, but at least where i'm at in the south its a livable income. Also maybe its just the people you surround yourself with but most people I know that are in the 20-30 range only make 30-50k and still live with their parents. I'm from NY (fortunately I don't live there anymore) but all of my friends are 24-27 and I think only about 3-5 of them have moved out of their parents house and thats out of about 30 people. I feel like this idea that people judge you based off of the money you make is crazy maybe i'm just being naive though. [end]
[start] First, stop putting such importance on what people think about you. Fuck these people who put a value on you based on how you make money. When you get your head straight and feel confident in understanding yourself, friends will come. These people you have around you are not friends.     Second, find something you enjoy that's free. Reading, nature, volunteering, the world around you, whatever. You need this as a distraction from what you HAVE to do. Who knows, you may even turn it into a job you enjoy.      Third, happiness comes from within. You can be the master or the slave to your own mind. Thoughts have power, take the power back. Read, watch videos, figure it out because nobody else can do it for you.     Finally, if you have a chemical imbalance or suffer from severe depression, see a professional. Therapists, free clinics...look and you will find them.     Hope any of this helps.     [end]
[start] Too much to do tonight thus no time to read the other comments, so I am hoping I am not repeating something.  It doesn't matter how much you earn or what your educational background is. You are already better than those that look down their noses at someone. YOU have provided for yourself all these years. YOU made it through the hard times and YOU are still the one making improvements to YOUR life. The opinions of others doens't matter. Everyone will hit a rough patch in life eventually. Life is not linear. For some reinventing themselves/re-educating happens twice or thrice in a lifetime. For others it is more natural to stick to one thing.  The bottom line is, as long as you are not someone mooching of others than you shouldn't feel bad about yourself.  You also show taht you have ambitions which is a positive trait. Good luck with that new job.....if it doesn't work out don't give up. When one door closes there are multiple others to set your sights on. Life doesn't happen according to the timetable of others. This is true for career/education/relationships/children/achievement in hobbies etc. [end]
[start] What if I were to tell you that you could learn to code and in 2 years be making $100k working from home, and in 4 years be making $300k? I was once in your position too. If you're into nerdy things and fall in love with programming, the dream is very real. [end]
[start] This might have already been said but your coworker has a wrong view on minimum wage and she's just one person.  In a lot of cases minimum wage is the employer saying "I'd pay you less if I could get away with it, but legally I have to pay this much"  [end]
[start] Wow that’s terrible. Sounds like your boss is super socially unaware. But there’s no excuse for saying something like that that’s obviously going to make someone feel bad. Sorry you had to put up with that. Hope you enjoyed your mcflurry! [end]
[start] Please don't feel like a loser. At least you have a job, and even though you are battling mental illness, you are intelligent and come across as relatively healthy.  What's wrong with working in a call center? I think 30k a year is good money - I've made less most of my life & I'm old enough to be your mother. Go look in the mirror and tell yourself: "I am a winner." You are.  [end]
[start] You sound intelligent, aware and write very well. Keep pushing towards your goals. You are capable.  [end]
[start] I can definitely relate but I think being independent and supporting yourself is the biggest thing a person can achieve imo. If someone looks down on you they not only have no respect for your hard work they probably have had everything handed to them anyway and dont actually know what living in poverty is like.  [end]
[start] You’re not a loser, I think you’re impressive  [end]
[start] I love your username. You are a beautiful life.  [end]
[start] Jeez, that was hard to read in all honesty. I don't think you're a loser, and I especially respect those in low wage jobs because you guys know your priorities.  Your boss is a moron and has no tact at all.   Btw I share some of your pain, I went from 16k to 24k (24k is good in the uk) but it doesn't make you happier. I thought it would [end]
[start] Your boss is shortsighted and seems a bit cruel. Raising the minimum wage will increase everyone's quality of life, even people who don't get paid the minimum. Keeping people down does not work. I bet your boss uses all of the conveniences of modern life. These are all things that were made to make life better and not worse, so that people can do things easier, allowing access to a standard of living that was previously only available to the very wealthy. What a stupid thing to say and I hope she gets a hangnail every time she thinks it.  [end]
[start] Yeah, some people think like that and those people are assholes. Their family and friends - if they have any - are probably also aware that they're assholes. I know some people like that. They will also trashtalk successful people, because then they're jealous. They look down on those who are beneath them because they're "less than" and they look down on their equals because no way are those people as special and ambitious as THEY are, and they hate their betters more than anyone else.   Nobody sees you the way you see yourself. All your life, you have front row seats to every screw-up you've ever made, every unflattering thought that ever goes through your head, every moment of weakness, every bad decision. Is that really, truly how you think the people around you see you? I'd be really surprised if they did.  [end]
[start] I'm a little bit hesitant to post this, because I'm not sure if it'll encourage or discourage you. I hope this doesn't just end up feeling negative.  Most of your post is about your job, and in particular your wage.  But a few things stand out to me. You mention multiple serious mental breakdowns, as well as being suicidal all your life.  Look I'm far from a mental health professional, but are you sure this is really about your job? I share a lot of similar feelings that you describe here, and I'm in a pretty good situation financially (not trying to brag, I swear - it's relevant, just bear with me).  So I'm going to tell you a little about me, to explain. Feel free to ignore if you don't care - I don't mind, really. But on the off chance that this might help with some perspective or at least make you feel less alone, here it goes.  So to start off, I'm not trying to perfectly equate our situations. It sounds like you have more shit to deal with than me, so I'm sure what you're going through is even worse than what I have. You have my sympathy and empathy, but forgive me if I don't 100% understand what you're going through.  So as I mentioned above, financially, I've got things sorted out. This is due, in large part, to luck. Don't get me wrong, I worked hard to get here, but it sounds like you're working at least as hard. Sometimes where you end up is largely due to circumstance. It sucks, but it's just the way it is sometimes. I do not consider myself to be a better person than you.  So I know what you mean about being suicidal. I'm not sure I'd say I've been suicidal for my whole life, but it's definitely been a struggle for a long time. I waited way too long to seek help, but even with help, it's still a struggle.  When I first got to the point that I knew I couldn't go on alone anymore, I was in university. I was constantly stressed, anxious, depressed. I had similar money issues to you back then. Despite my parents' best intentions, they're not rich. I had to finance a lot on my own, and it was not fun for a while in there. One of the things that always kept me going was my long-term goals. First and foremost among them being financial stability that I was sure I would get once I graduated. Unlike many (most?) people in this generation, I actually did eventually get lucky and find that financial independence.  Now I brought up all this background stuff because here's the thing: it didn't help. At all. If anything, it made things worse, somehow. For years my only vision in life was to graduate, get a good job, get money. I was convinced that it would make everything better and end all my struggles.  Once I finally achieved this goal, it felt empty. Completely, utterly, void of meaning or importance. It makes some things easier, for sure. There are comforts that come with having money, but they're fleeting. I think part of the reason I didn't care about my success was the fact that I came to the realization that this doesn't make me a better person. Sure, I accomplished a goal, I got some money, but so what? Does it really matter?  I went through a phase of reckless spending. I thought at first that money wasn't helping me be happy because I wasn't using it, just letting it accumulate in a bank account.  I bought a car, a house that was too big, a big TV, a new computer. Every time I ended up disappointed.  This stuff doesn't matter. It doesn't create happiness. It doesn't solve life problems. It's superficial and meaningless. And once you get to a place that you've been working towards for so long, envisioning, fantasizing about, and it doesn't make you feel like you thought it would... Well then you feel lost. You don't have a goal anymore. You made it, finally, accomplished everything you wanted, and it didn't fix anything. Now what?  So I ask you again, is this really about your job? I'm sure it feels like that now, but if you made more money, would that really help in the ways you hope? Maybe your job is just the easiest thing to point at and say "that's the problem in my life", but really it's about more than that? [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing this. You're not a loser at all. You're a fucking hero and I mean that. You've stormed the beaches of post modern banality with gallantry and your determination is immense.   It feels weird trying to give you advice because honestly I feel like you are the one who has more advice, but one thing that may help the journey is finding ways to keep yourself well mentally. I can't recommend meditation enough. I know it may seem like a temporary salve or a way to dull a bad situation, but it really truly can shift your perspective on life to a point where the opinions of others mean nothing to you, and you could literally be shoveling shit but will feel content within. This is so much more than just "putting on a happy face". If you have any questions I'm always available.  [end]
[start] I couldn’t have said it better myself.......I consider you a kindred spirit  [end]
[start] Hear me out. I have been in the same spot. Feeling shame for your current station in life. You don't have to work where other people want you to. You are not your job. Your job is not your source of identity.  It's just what you do. That said, I think you should be proud of yourself for working hard for what you have. I know that doesn't always help. But you sound like a great person. You deserve to be happy. Don't let other peoples dumbass opinions ruin your life.   I worked for many years in fast food. I didn't think I could get a job outside of that particular industry. I suffered endlessly. Recently I said fuck it and went for a new job. My life was falling apart. But I had a burning desire for something new. I ended up getting a better job. It's still in food. But it's at a deli. I actually really love my new job. Things are great there. I feel like everyone could use getting a change of pace. That's what it took for me. You sound smart enough to know that your value doesn't come from what you do for a living. Your value comes from how you live. Don't give up my friend. Thank you for venting off your feelings. Not enough people talk about what's going on these days and it worries me. Things will get better. Just fight through the bullshit. [end]
[start] Those who look down on you probably couldn’t last a day in your shoes giving the cards you were dealt! Take pride in your perseverance!  [end]
[start] I feel this bro or sis.  Turning 30 2 years ago and looking at my status was so depressing.  Constantly trying to figure out how to climb a rung and getting slapped in the face on the way up.  You're not alone, but contrary to what some are saying here, a lot of unknowingly privileged people (oh my parents paid for my college and their friend offered me a corporate job out of graduation aka I worked "hard" to get here because I had to study once) DO think this way.  And they suck to be around even when they're trying to be nice.   Just here to say, you go get that McFlurry, I'll get one too, and send you a virtual cheers. [end]
[start] It's stories like this and people like you that end up breaking through. Just don't give up hope. I'm also 30 living in a high cost city and only make 30k a year and everyday I have a new grey hair. I work my ass off 60-70 hrs a week to see my money evaporate but I have a family. My own family is my support system. I don't know how, or when but I'll come out on top. So will you. [end]
[start] Thank your for sharing.  You have truly inspired me today [end]
[start] Many people are insecure and try to find their own value in the career they have and how much money they make. They  belittle people that have less valued careers or make less money to try and feel better about themselves. It really means nothing and people like your boss are not even worth listening to. You have been working hard and have a right to be proud of yourself.    People who dedicate full time hours to a company should be compensated fairly for their work. For an employee to commit that much time of their own life to a company, helping that company make profits, but not even make making enough money for themselves to cover their own basic necessities for living is just not right. Anyone (like your boss) who thinks that is fair is delusional in my opinion.  [end]
[start] You're not a loser. You're just trying to get by like any of us.  I'm a good bit older than you and only recently landed a truly well-paying job with good benefits. I lost most of my friends along the way because they resented my years-long effort to get through school and get certified for this job. Then when I got here, some of my coworkers look down on me because of my blue collar background. It doesn't matter how good I am at the job. If they accept the fact that I'm good at it, then that means they're no better than some dumbass blue collar loser, right? So they have a bad attitude about everything I do and say. They don't want me here, and a couple of them are actively working to get me fired or get me to leave on my own. But I'm still here! Still hustling, still making money. They don't understand how weak they look when compared to all the suffering of the past.  It's amazing to see the number of people who will shamelessly try to hold you down because it makes them feel better about themselves, whether it's in your current job or whatever "better" job you may move to later. To hell with them all. You keep on hustling and keep on saving those peanuts every payday. They will add up and you will do better and better while the haters continue to circle their own little fishbowls (or toilets). Your suicidal ideation is a product of being gaslighted by those jerks for all these years. You need supporters just like anybody else, but true friends are hard to come by. You know about the gaslighting now, and so many of these commenters on Reddit are confirming it to you. You're not a loser at all. You're a hard-working MFer just trying to make his way through life and you deserve respect. [end]
[start] Tell them to fuck off. You never have to be ashamed of having an honest job! If you’re on welfare when you’re young and healthy, THEN you should be ashamed. [end]
[start] Who the HELL do they think they are shaming you!!??  I am a single mother, no child support, own my home, paid off my own my car, go out to eat or a movie occasionally, save up and take vacations all on 35k a year!  I make 35k after 10 years of employment where I started at 28k.  I do not consider myself poor.  Do you live in an expensive state?    The ONLY family members that put my job or pay down are the ones sitting on their butts collecting welfare and addicted to their free pain pills.    And LASTLY STOP STOP STOP putting yourself down.  We have enough enemies in this world without you becoming your own worst enemy.   [end]
[start] There is much more respect in how hard someone works then how much money someone makes. You are far more respectable then your boss. She, having never lived the life you have has no right to speak on such topics. Be proud. You’ve overcome things most people don’t have the strength to overcome.  [end]
[start] dealing with ignorance is always tough, especially when it hits home.   It's proven that rising from the social position you are born into is extremely difficult but so many people look down their noses at people struggling to do so or people succumbing to the personal limitations brought about by their position.  And what's ironic is that so often the middle-class people I hear complaining about the folks that are stuck at the bottom have not risen beyond the middle-class status they were born into. In fact, it's often the case that they've taken it for granted and done worse than their parents.   I know a couple working-class guys whose parents were upper middle-class and complain about how the poor are lazy. Dudes, you've gone down two rungs and now your kids are going to have a harder time rising. Look in the mirror. [end]
[start] I’m studying at a medical school with a lot of things going for me and i wish I could have your character and strength. You still have many years ahead of you and I think that your perseverance will be rewarded. [end]
[start] Where can we donate? [end]
[start] I’ve been feeling that failure aspect a lot lately. I’ve only been out of college for 6 months and I’m currently working a weekend only job at a newspaper to get some experience under my belt, but I don’t think it will evolve into full time which is fine, it’s a small paper. So I considered getting a job at Starbucks or something during the week to make some more money. My parents are trying to be as supportive as possible but they accuse me of “being okay with working at Starbucks the rest of my life”  If a job doesn’t use what I learned in college it’s useless but it’s very hard to find a job that uses English/Media for me when I don’t want to move to Georgia or Canada or film or become a teacher. I’m only 22 and my parents are already teaching me to look down on other jobs because I’d be a failure to accept them.  [end]
[start] You're not a loser. I have 50k in student loan debt, I work for a job that I dislike, but I make decent money, and I have a motorcycle- the single thing that has allowed me to stay sane. I never got called a loser, but I oftentimes felt out of my depth, because the skills I was gaining were tangentially related to my passion but not on the mark. I could stay at the company i'm with and rise if I wanted to, but I've seen how upper management has to deal with stress, and I don't want to advance in a field I don't love.    I have a potential opportunity coming up that might be a way out, and into the field I want to be in. I also might be switching motorcycles. I just wanted to say, it doesn't matter if 'everyone' thinks you're  a loser. It's only true if you believe it. Keep working toward your goals, and screw anyone who says different, because they haven't walked in your shoes. If you need someone to talk to or vent to, PM me. You don't know me, and I don't know you,  but if I can help, I'll do so.   [end]
[start] I think this is more prevailant in the modern era where people post updates about how amazing their miserable lives are.  Honestly, being happy is more important than a job. If youre happy where you are than that's great. If you're ashamed of where you work and it's making you depressed than consider making a switch.   I'm 32 and I used to be an insurance broker making decent money. I decided that this wasn't the calling for me. I decided to help a friend open a painting business. I'm making less money but much happier. Once we build the company, it will be something that I think will make me extremely happy. Sometimes if you're stuck in a rut, you should see where you think you'll be happiest and make a plan to get there. You're later self will thank you.  You're not a loser. There's lots of people who worked hard after 40 to build a successful life for themselves.  [end]
[start] I wish you the best of luck. There are very few people in this world that have the fortune to work a job they love for a high salary. We’re all making compromises. Keep focusing on bettering what you want to improve, and I think other peoples comments will seem to matter less.  [end]
[start] It easier to lift yourself up on the shoulders of others than build your own mountains. You sound like you have a nice mountain:)  [end]
[start] Hey man this was a humbling read for me. Ive spent the last year working a minimum wage retail job where at the end of every month my bank accounts hits the bottom of its overdraft. I spent 5 years in college skating by, living off of loans and grants and having an easy ride. I dropped out in my final year due to poor grades but wasn’t worried as i’d always winged my way through life. Now a year later this work is killing me. Depression, anxiety, insomnia yep you name it.   While i feel this is a horrible situation for me and i am scared of the future im also very motivated. I feel like i needed this humbling in my life to grow up and see how it really is. Appreciate you sharing your story.  [end]
[start] You matter bud. Don’t let anyone tell you any different. Life isn’t some contest where the score is kept in money. Maybe it’s kept in understanding, your relationships, your effect on those around you, but not money. Hang in there. [end]
[start] A loser is someone who quits doing what's hard in exchange for a worse, easier life. You don't sound like a loser.  [end]
[start] I don’t think you are a loser, and I can empathize some - I just turned 30 in August and felt like a failure in my career for a long time. Took me  7 years out of college to get to a 50k plus job (and that’s WITH a degree).   I understand this is a lament more or less, But there is some serious defeatism in your words. I’m not saying you aren’t a victim in some ways, but the victim/poverty mind set is never going to help you. Success is a long road for most, and there isn’t anything wrong with slowly getting there.   That being said... leaving shitty jobs has served me well over the past few years, shitty jobs are stepping stones that you use to slowly move up. You can do it! Just be patient and keep scrapping! [end]
[start] I work as a biller and a collector and i talk to people in call centers for a good portion of my day. Sometimes the friendly voice on the end of the line is relieving. I have never looked down on people who fill those postitions because i know how hard of a job it can be, people can be dicks. It probably doesnt help much but there is nothing to be ashamed of. Keep your head up.  [end]
[start] Hey man if you were my friend I’d be damn proud of you and not ashamed of you at all. I have a friend right now that didn’t go through college and I’m sure he’s experiencing a lot of the same stuff you are. The people that chose to leave you because of your situation aren’t the people you want in your life. I see a bright future for you man, just keep going.  [end]
[start] If you really are a hard worker, and you can consistently show a positive attitude (even when you don’t want to) I promise it will work out for you. People judge attitude, especially in business, so while it sounds like you have a shitty boss, you can decide how you let it effect you.   Being in your twenties and not having money is pretty normal. It’s all about developing good work habits, busting your ass, and turning your skills into more money in your 30’s.   It sounds like you have made a lot of sacrifices and deserve good things to happen to you. Do your best to keep a good attitude and don’t forget to ask for what you want. No one is going to hand you anything!   [end]
[start] Fuck that shit. Forget other people’s opinions.  [end]
[start] Fuck that noise. You do you, forget emotions like guilt and shame. Don't feel sorry for yourself or others, you're stronger that that. No reason to have nay goals except for what you can keep to yourself, in moderation of course. You'll probably make more in the future with tenure and inflation. [end]
[start] Personally, I think people like to feel accomplished and superior by drawing lines between them and different people. Minimum wage doesn't mean it's that's person's fault. It is mostly wrong genetics, environment or simply because a job that matches that person's skill does not exist. They know some people can't escape their position so they abuse them mentally to feel superior in a sense. Happens in social animals. It's basically in the human genetics so we have to bear with it and try to stay afloat. [end]
[start] Subs like this shouldn’t be an /r/all because from that context this just seems like a long winded self-absorbed whiny rant. But then you realize that the subreddit is literally /r/self and it makes more sense. [end]
[start] stop caring what other people think so much [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] If you could turn shit around, gtfo that mother fucking job. Seriously. People need to learn and live and grow, if you have homeless shelter look it up, go there and use the free time you have to learning or getting a better job. Seriously. [end]
[start] I am not sure where you live but the best thing I ever did for myself was move. You don’t need a lot of money to move either so many apartments in cities cost 300-400$. With 30k a year you can easily turn your life around in a lot of major cities. I live in Pittsburgh and  my life has improved dramatically.  Moving might be tough but at the end of the day it might be what is best for you. [end]
[start] Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, no matter how wrong it is.     You could kt it that if it weren't for a minimum wage, she'd probably be getting paid less because the scale would shift downward.     There are also jobs that need to be filled that some people would turn their noses up at no matter the pay.  And if not for a decent minimum wage, people have to work 2 and 3 jobs to make ends meet, which means fewer jobs to go around for everyone.     You could make the argument using healthcare as an analogy.   Los of people were against the affordable care act--until they needed it.   You never know when you (she) might be out of a job and relying on a decent minimum wage to carry on.   I'd argue that no matter how high the minimum wage there will always be people who strive for more and always be people who are satisfied with less.  [end]
[start] If you don’t go to college you need to work your way into a skilled trade or a niche job that other people don’t know how to do. My brother and I used to work in call centers and we made it out. We’re both currently making 50k. He’s a carpenter installing windows and I print shit in a mailroom. Just get your resume out and start branching out into other fields until you find something that feels right. Trust me on this cubicle life will kill you.  [end]
[start] I mean, I know it’s later in life but I’m just curious why you don’t go into the military or a skilled trade apprenticeship program when you were 18/19 like many disadvantaged youths do to escape the very life and prospects you have? [end]
[start] Sorry if this is a bit off topic, but where do you live to consider 30k bad? [end]
[start] Have you tried whiskey? [end]
[start] > **Most middle-class people** want nothing to do with someone in their mid-twenties who makes a low wage unless they're a student or an intern.  I stopped there.  Self defeatist are not fun to be around.  [end]
[start] Try not to judge yourself so  harshly!!! Just tell everyone your a struggling artist. [end]
[start] Again, you are a narcissist.  [end]
[start] "When someone younger than me who has never worked a minimum wage job..."  Why do you think she's never worked a minimum wage job? What did she do that you didn't? [end]
[start] Damn, man. That got me. What do you suggest we do for folks in your situation? I dont think that raising the minimum wage would be a good solution because it would cause the prices of goods and services to go up also. And the people who werent on minimum before would then require a raise. What if we could lower taxes or have some sort of program to provide low cost housing etc [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Too long; didn't read.  [end]
[start] Have you ever considered looking into the energy sector? Or even perhaps becoming a lineman  It's hard work, but the pay is good [end]
[start] Why don't you try to go to school if you went into programming its about 2 years and $15,000 on the high end and you'd be making triple what you are right now [end]
[start] Hey man, you're almost out. If you can get the upgrade to $45k and keep progressing, you'll be financially stable in no time. Hang in there and good luck.  [end]
[start] If it helps, I feel like I just read a brave post by a smart man. [end]
[start] Don’t know if you’ll see this but you’re my fuckin hero. You’ve worked so much harder than me all of your adult life and after all the knocks you still get up every day. You’re just awesome. Give me a message if you ever need to talk.  [end]
[start] I can't claim to know how other people think, but I don't think you're a loser. I think you're a grafter, you have integrity and you're independent. These are all things to be proud of. You deserve good things, and you will get those good things some day soon I hope!  Your manager sounds ignorant and small minded. I'd be interested to know if she's completely self made, or if she's accepted help to get to where she is. - nothing wrong with it, but starting with a head start doesn't make you a better person.  Stand tall, enjoy your McFlurry.  Edit: punctuation.  [end]
[start] Why don't you try learning a skill that can earn you more? Be software developer or something. [end]
[start] i will never understand why people feel the need to criticize another person making an honest living  [end]
[start] You are a perfectly normal and functioning member of society. There are many people who are not those things.   What’s more, you have goals and aspirations (to move up to a 45k/year job). Which is awesome as well.   I know post docs (people with PhDs doing 30k/year work) that still mooch off their family.   You’re doing great, trust me.  [end]
[start] Fuck that. Keep hustling. One day, it will pay off. People notice the grind, so just keep on yours. [end]
[start] The people that judge like the one in your post are ignorant and like to feel better by putting others below them using arbitrary reasons. This economic system is a cancer upon the world, a cancer upon most of it's citizens. In order to create a worthwhile future we need to break away from it, the system is designed to crush people like you and me under it. People slave away and they won't see any real reward in return, greedy and power hungry people made sure of that.  [end]
[start] OP is a f***ing boss. You've been grinding hard and long, and you stand on your own two feet because of it. There are ALOT of people you're age who still use the bank of mum and dad often due to poor money management and/or lack of desire to work hard enough (there are also those that work hard and end up behind mind you).  Regarding programming, having a degree is absolutely useless in practice in the real world when it comes to programming; what you learn is theory and crude , long winded methods. As soon as you hot industry you have to relearn everything. Following YouTubers who have actually experience and teach you industry standards with tips and tricks is much more powerful. Build something, anything with efficient resilient code and you're already doing better than the vast, vast majority of grads who cannot do the same. [end]
[start] Your boss sounds like a very cruel insensitive person. I’m sorry you have to be around someone like that, hopefully you have enough space between each other that you can protect yourself and function. [end]
[start] Being a loser or a winner is a mindset. You have obviously orked very hard and overcome many struggles to get where you are. Fuck what others think of you. There are always going to be People to compare yourself to, People who have more or less (People often choose to compare themselves only to those who have more).  Keep a positive mindset and keep striving on as you seem to have been doing - the universe will meet you there an bring good people into your life. Wish you all the best of strength and luck. [end]
[start] When hiring, I generally try to find people like you. [end]
[start] You've worked so hard to get this far. Don't let a judgy jerk take that away from you. I bet she's never worked as hsrd as you have to vet where you are today, and thats why its easy for her to be judgemental. Screw em, and be proud of your accomplishments. [end]
[start] I was in your position. I’m glad you are working towards your goals. Stay strong. And we all deserve a living wage. [end]
[start] I too suffer depression and I use my job to focus getting out of bed, I have a good career and earn a good pay but I keep a work life balance and have a busy social calendar too I make time for friends and family as I need time to have fun and I need to keep busy  you should too. I hope your ok. [end]
[start] If this is true then you are a warrior and no one can take that away from you. [end]
[start] She doesn’t think you’re a loser. If she did she wouldn’t have said that to you. She is young and naive and I bet would be shocked to hear that you yourself were recently one of the people she was writing off. Her comments said a lot about her ignorance and nothing about you. I bet if you actually told her your experience it would be a really big wake up call to her since I suspect she actually respects you a lot. [end]
[start] your perception of yourself is 10 times as important as how others perceive you. no one can see you in your complete entirety, not even you. but you can see the best picture of yourself based on how you choose to view yourself.  people will talk about anything and anyone. but that’s all it is, just talk and no walk. as hard and tough as it is, you’re still here. you’re still going. i will never know the kind of pain and suffering you know daily and i am sure there are many like me. but i am also sure there are many like you, who work and grind each and every day [end]
[start] Reading this made my heart hurt. I wish I could help. Like so many others have said, most of us don't think you are a loser. I hope you can believe that, and that knowing it will help a little.  Stay strong. [end]
[start] Forgive my ignorance but I could never understand why so many people can't seem to be able to find a lucrative thing to do and like and do it. I figured it out by the time I was 20.  Honest question.  [end]
[start] People only mock you because they are too afraid to crticize themselves.  [end]
[start] I will add exactly what others are saying.   You are owning life.   You are doing incredibly well and don't let other people try and put you down. You have goals, much more than most people that will put you down ever have.  I admire your drive and commitment you are an inspiration.   I started a career late in life that was full of people younger than me. Constantly being put down and asked is it strange that your 30 and your boss is 20. You have a goal and stick with it. I am now working in my dream job (making average to above average if I work overtime pay) and I tell you chasing your goals is worth everything. Not saying I have had it as bad but I can promise you when you got your goals and get that nicer car, have the next 6 months rent sorted in your account and can focus on your next goal that is making life. People live month to month and hand to mouth and earn a lot more than us both in a more sociable acceptable job and I bet deep down they are more unhappy.   Stick to achieving your goals. Stick to doing you. I'm proud of you for working so hard.  [end]
[start] Whaa fukin whaa... easy little strawberry it could always b waaay worse. Focus on nothing but love in your life that is either Near you or from you. U can change everything. [end]
[start] Tough situation. Let you define who you are. From what I hear, you are a conscientious hard-working person. That deserves your own self respect. I’d also say to keep your eyes open!  Lots of people I know did not find a job they’re happy with until in their 30’s. Keep your eyes open for people who hustle too...buy them a coffee and ask them about their career paths. With patience, a willingness to work, and a desire to learn...I am confident you will find options. Keep your chin up!  You have it tough, but I think you are doing great!  Reliable, diligent people will find decent work usually. Let me know if I can help.  [end]
[start] Your boss sounds like a horrible person. Those jobs NEED to be done. And people DESERVE to be paid for them. Paid enough to live on, to support themselves and their kids, and to be able to afford medications that they need (amongst other things). I hate that attitude that minimum wage is for people who are less than others, or only for people that don’t need to support themselves.   You’re not a loser because of your job. I work at Walmart. I’m older than you and I have a college degree that I’ll be paying for for the rest of my life, and I still ended up here. And I’m not the only one. I did manage to get a pharmacy tech position, after 9 months of being a cashier. My point is that your job doesn’t define you. You need to work to pay your bills, and the job needs to be done by someone. Preferably someone who isn’t completely miserable at work because they work all the time and can’t make ends meet. You’re making those ends meet, and I know a lot of people closer to 40 that don’t/can’t, so you’re doing something right.  [end]
[start] I absolutely cannot put myself in your shoes. I'm really sorry that some people disrespect you because of your job. It's hard to get out of poverty. I can see all around me that sometimes the situation would not get better for years. Sometimes there's just no luck or open doors. I hope it gets better for you and you have better and more fun and relaxed future. Don't let people get to you. Some people are just entitled idiots who don't understand what any other person might have gone through. Hope fortune smiles upon you. [end]
[start] My man. You give me hope that everything is gonna be alright if we just believe in ourselves and work our asses off. Nothing but love and support for you. ❤️❤️  [end]
[start] You are an inspiration, that is all I have to say. Tbh I hope this comment gets to you, sending good vibes your way \~ chin up homie! :3 [end]
[start] This is so inspirational. I also come from a family where we have to work hard for our money, and this shit ain’t easy. I’m surrounded by people that are all better off then me. Keep your head up and just know that most people respect your work ethic, courage and determination. You have already adhesives SO SO SO much all on your own, I can guarantee that’s a lot more than most of these assholes that judge you can say. [end]
[start] You have every right to be proud of yourself. That’s quite an inspirational story :).   One thing that helps me is to write out a list of all the things I’m grateful and say that to myself. I find it helps a lot in dark times.  [end]
[start] I am 28m who has never even had a girlfriend and suffers from social anxiety and depression and has attempted suicide more then once. Despite all that i managed somehow to make it through college and get a 70k+ job, a new car (well in 2015 it was new), and a house. This post made me realize just how fucking good i actually have it. [end]
[start] You are doing great! Only ass****s think like her and their opinion does not count.  [end]
[start] Your work isn’t you, it’s something you do, but not who you are, people forget that. Fuck your boss. [end]
[start] Honestly i read the first part thinking you were in the UK and it sounded like a very normal "average" life. America is fucked and has weird standards for people. Fuck me have you ever been on r finanicalindapendance if your not malking 300k a year and retired by 40 your a failure.   In the UK even with a degree 30k is good no one expects more than 75k ever for being even upper manegment. More if your self employed or a contractor or some lucrative bussiness. Most people have like 5 friends or something, hardly anyone goes to uni or not as many as used too. Apprenticeships are much more usefull. Very few people own houses or cars especially younger people.   Fuck everyone else man you just do you and be happy doing whatever it is makes you happy. [end]
[start] I wanna piggy back on what someone was saying and that is that people from the age 18-35 are having hard time finding solid jobs and finding a place that is cheap enough to live but not a total dump.  I'm in the same boat right now. I'm much younger (only 22) but I recently had one of those days where there seems to be no hope. That you're stuck and you'll never be able to save for anything that you want or want to do. You have to think of the bigger picture. People who are successful dont instantly get what they want or get the perfect job. You have to start from the bottom. And if you start from the bottom a little later, that's ok. Everyone's life has a different time line. You just haven't gotten to the part where you are doing and have the things you want in life yet.  Building your life takes time and people need to understand that. The people around you have been assholes to be honest. Surrounding yourself with positive people is important and I'm sorry that people have treated you like that. No one who is grinding deserves to be put down like that.  Find what makes you happy and work towards that. You are your own motivation and once you see progress, it's like a drug. Feed off of that and make your life the way you want to live it.  And to be clear I'm not trying to say like "Stop being depressed!" Because our generation has been there. We know what it's like to feel the impending doom of life and  thinking about what the whole point of all of this is and where it leads us. You do you boo boo. No homo.   [end]
[start] I've been in your shoes and the only reason I'm not homeless is due to getting lucky with people around me seeing humanity in myself rather than a don't kid in his early 20s. Now I'm in my kid 20s and I'm still struggling but I've built a solid base and again it's only because I'm lucky. I hated being poor and I hate still being broke, though not poor anymore [end]
[start] You are absolutely a winner.  If you are getting better instead of worse, then that's a great trend. Define success on YOUR terms.    I know exactly how you feel.  You are not alone.  [end]
[start] Thanks for making it this far. Your existence validates my medial existence too. I'm not going to compare, it's just I've been going through similar feelings. It really does suck to compare what you see out there and what you feel you are. I've done it so many times I've convinced myself that people really don't know what it means to struggle. And because I am struggling, I know enjoying life comes less and less often. It's to the point where enjoying life is a luxury. Anyone who disagrees doesn't know that level of struggle. And honestly, I'm glad they don't. For if it were me or them, I would much rather have to bear the burden than anyone else.   &#x200B;  Thanks again for posting this. You really showed a maturity that shouldn't be had for another 10-15 years. Even if you stand below in society's structure, you'll always be above in life's experiences.  [end]
[start] I feel you OP. I work a low paying job in a supermarket, and constantly get the "I'm better than you" attitude. I was an honor grad in high school, but not enough scholarships/grants for college so I started working out of high school, joined the service, and now barely make enough to get by... and it stings that people judge me by my job rather than by me. I try not to let it get to me but... damn its hard; especially when you take into account I never have re adjusted to civilian life. [end]
[start] I was talking to my some of my friends at work a few months ago.  I've always worked in low paid jobs and I know a lot of people in my hometown who are unemployed. Last year I landed the job I have now which is a professional one with good pay. The friends I'm talking about have the same job with the same pay.  Basically I was making the point that our job is far easier than the jobs I used to work and also far easier than most people work, yet we also get paid much more than most people our age. I was saying that in fact we are so overpaid for what we do.  They didn't agree. They said that we get paid more because "we use our brains". That's the reason why others are worse off, they don't think for their jobs. I was surprised, definitely got the feeling they were being superior.  That view does exist, but I think it's only held by people who come from a wealthy background and have no experience with minimum wage. The majority of people are more like me and you and understand what it's like.  [end]
[start] Man, I can relate to this so much. You're not alone. I work two jobs and I still come home feeling ashamed of myself. I have worked every day since I was 16. People I have been friends with since I was very young started to ignore me because I couldn't afford to take trips with them or party at clubs. I work 75 hours a week and have little to save after paying my bills. I worry everyday about the "what ifs" like what if I get sick and can't work or what if I get laid off. People have no idea how debilitating these fears are. The older I get, the harder it is to try and just endure a little bit longer hoping for some easier days. Just know you aren't the only one feeling like this. Keep fighting through it.  [end]
[start] I bought a puppy.  Best thing I ever did. He is my best friend, we walk together, watch movies, talk to people at obedience school, i get all my advice from the vet. Change your perspective my man.   You had a friend die. That is the worst. But living with cancer was painful and dibilitating. They are in a better place and died with all of their loved ones in their heart. As often as you think about them, they would think about you.  Your job is... a job. Live the weekend, man. We are our own worst enemy and pur biggest judge of character, but thats why hobbies and socialising is so important. People who see you when they talk to you (aside from your terrible boss lizard) can read all of your language and engage in conversation on a metaphysical level. The people you engage over that phone treat you as a warm body.   You have everything you nees in you. Fight the depression. Medication, exercise and social engagement will lead you far from where you are friendo. You need a little bit of self discipline and you are also not a loser. Your poo boss is a loser.  [end]
[start] It’s all relative. I made roughly 20k/year through my 20s working various jobs and winding up in an entry level with a nonprofit. Living that way with a college degree while seeing all of my colleagues from high school and college succeeding so extraordinarily really brought me down, I can really empathize with OPs mentions of feeling worthless etc. I just turned 30, and it came along with a huge promotion and 30k/year. This was momentous for me and brought my self esteem up in a big way, and it’s a pretty pathetic salary in the big picture. I also make what is for me (no dependents or mortgage debt) a living wage doing something that I know is toward a good cause. Other people don’t determine your value, you do! [end]
[start] I was at a similar job for a long time and know how you feel.  What area do you work?  I hire folks like you that are resilient and know how to deal with people.  Lmk  [end]
[start] You’re no loser. I have nothing but respect for people who work for minimum wage. People in those jobs have to deal with the worst of society and don’t deserve to be shamed [end]
[start] Some of the people I look up to most in my life have little money and dont have prestigious jobs. That's because they are good people with good characters. That matters so much more than where they work [end]
[start] Block the noise.  Keep your feet and mind moving forward.  Look for another job if possible.  Best way to increase wages if your company won't give a raise.  Try going into welding or some other trade.  Post your resume to LinkedIn.  Enough self pity and believe in yourself.  That's all that matters.  Never let others control how you feel.  People are horrible.  Attach yourself to people who are positive and not shitty. [end]
[start] You may not see this, but your hard work is far more admirable than you think. From what I’ve read you are leaps and bounds more respectable, caring, and ahead in life than people who have college degrees. I know it is SO hard to see it now, but what you are going through now will give you more wisdom than you could ever know, you will realize that as you grow older. You are building character and that is all that matters.   Some recommendations coming from a finance major in college:  Put any money you can save in a Goldman Sachs Marcus online savings account, it pays 1.95% interest.  If you have any debt, pay off that with the extra money you have left over first. Also, if you can find a shared living space it could reduce your costs considerably. Finally, look for a government job that gives good health insurance and benefits, or think about going to trade school, you can make very good money from either of those without paying a lot of money to get a college degree. Hope this helps, you are stronger than you think, wake up every morning, tell yourself that, and believe it, your outlook on life will change! [end]
[start] personally I think everyone should work a food service job just to know what it feels like from shitty customers. ive found that people who've worked food industry are more understanding, patient, and kinder to employees. I can understand where op is at I work 4 10hour days n then go to aviation mechnic school from 7-4 the other 3 days but I drive 70 miles one way to work and another 30-40 to school just so I can afford rent where its cheaper. on the flip side when im done with school ill have a much better job [end]
[start] I feel for you. You sound like such an amazing person. I'm not near your age and not quite the same situation, but I do know where you're coming from being looked down on because of your job and how you have to live. I understand how degrading it is. How you can take that feeling home with you, and how you can start to believe that you really ARE "less". I understand what it's like to wish you could just catch a break or beam yourself into one of their charmed lives for just one day. Keep on doing what you're doing and keep your head up. Hopefully some day you'll be where you want to be.  [end]
[start] You have a hell of a work ethic and you’re down to earth. I think you should try to get into working out it will do wonders on your self image and confidence. I wish you the success you deserve, remember to keep your head held up high. [end]
[start] never put someone down for making an honest wage..never. keep grinding and enjoy your mcflurry. [end]
[start] 8 years ago I was detailing cars in a car dealership for minimum wage.   For the last two years I’ve worked as a nurse care manager for $26 per hour.   I just accepted a new salaried job for $70k/year.   You can always improve your situation.   Remember, ignorance is hereditary. Those people were raised that way  [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing op. I am sorry you have a dumb boss that can't see how the world really is. you are much stronger than most for staying through all this. I am sure you will come out of this stronger. [end]
[start] Remember, every victory in life counts. The ones who count the highest are the ones who start at one. [end]
[start] wtf? 30k is about the average income per capita in the us + you live alone, whining about an average life, the heck [end]
[start] Sounds to me like you're making steps in the right direction-newer car (more reliable, presumably), higher job goals. Kudos for recognizing finishing daily goals makes a good day! You are worth *so* much more-don't harm or suicide. Even though you may not know them or see them, there *are* folks pulling for you. You got this thing figured out! You've got this! [end]
[start] While Ive never been in your position I have nothing but respect for people like you. You work incredibly hard just to make ends meet. I just want to say that the people who look down on you for that are idiots.  [end]
[start] Hey man I’m 20 and I don’t think you’re a loser. The only people I think are losers are the people that don’t treat others with the same respect as everyone else. I think it just depends how you’re raised. I see a lot of value in work and I think that’s because of how my dad raised me, and I’m honestly trying to get myself to go find parties or have “fun” like you said because I think I put too much value in work sometimes. I hope you get better man, you have a lot of life left to live. [end]
[start] >I'm not going to self-harm tonight and I'm not going to cry all night either. I cried on my way home and now I'm going to get myself a small oreo mcflurry and watch something funny.  Yes as you should because you deserve that. You deserve to laugh and Feel GOOD . self love is number one. Do what makes you feel good and happy . fuck what anybody has to say about it. You deserve the best and you are the only one who can make sure you are happy. Insteaf of focusing on the bad. Focus on the good. Tell yourself that today will be a good day. Stay positive. And i know it may be hard but as long as you TRY that is all that matters. You have the power to change your life . keep thinking positive and love yourself.  [end]
[start] People assume that people who work minimum wage jobs 1) aren’t capable of doing anything else and 2) their jobs must not be challenging since they don’t get paid well. Both of these things are simply not true. When my new boss found out I worked at McDonald’s briefly after high school he laughed in my face and told me I should never tell other people that because they will judge me for it. Really pissed me off. He’s a nice guy and generally very encouraging but he has a certain perspective of the world that is a bit tilted.  [end]
[start] That is not what people think. That is what spoiled assholes think.   You are a grown human and the fact that you are able to keep going only shows how fucking strong you are because i couldn't. You got my respect and even if it doesnt matter from a nameless stranger you have it. I'm proud of you  [end]
[start] The only person you can truly compare yourself to is the person you know you can be.  Only you know when you’ve tried your hardest. Only you know when you cut a few corners and if the circumstances life has thrown at you are cause to  throw your hands in the air and give up, or put your chin up and face the current struggle life has blessed you with.   In the words of one of the most inspirational speakers in my life Dr Jordan Peterson “Life is a struggle, pick up something as heavy as you can and carry it. “ the more responsibility you take upon yourself the more fulfilling your existence will be. Not because of the amount of money you are given but because of the purpose you are suffering for.  If you can always invoke a passion to do the job before you the best it can be done regardless if others are slacking or making more money I have always found that eventually somebody will notice and you will begin seeing the benefits of your integrity and hard work.  There are just as many miserable millionaires as there are homeless people in fact these miserable wealthy people are statistically the ones killing themselves.   Is it because maybe without the struggle/ reward dynamic they are often left feeling they have no purpose?? Money is an evil deception and if you are American I suggest the book “The creature from Jekyll Island” by G. Edward Griffin may set you free from the trap of being a slave for the hope of happiness.  Next time make it a large Oreo McFlurry you deserve it! [end]
[start] I can relate to this  [end]
[start] You are far from a loser. You wake up every morning and go to your job. The real losers are the people who sleep all day, wake up at 2, complain, and sponge off the government. In my eyes, anyone who wakes up and puts the effort into going to a job everyday no matter what you are doing or where you are working is a Star. [end]
[start] You are not a loser, nor are the millions of other people who work hard and are good citizens. The losers are those who rely solely on mommy and daddy, are trust fund babies who have never worked a day in their life, thieves/criminals, and those who judge others for no reason other than to build themselves up.  Stay strong! [end]
[start] Firstly, I am appalled at your boss's behavior. Something that I think this post shows is how good of a person you are for not having hatred for people that look down on you. Getting yourself out of poverty is a massive accomplishment. When people tell you someone somewhere has it worse, you should tell them you have had it worse and, regardless of people like them who tried to keep people down, you took yourself out of poverty. YOU. You don't owe that to anyone else. You are NOT a loser. IMO, being a kind poor person FAR outweighs being a rich asshole. I hope you reach all your goals in life. [end]
[start] I have nothing but respect for people who work hard at an honest job. Keep your head up friend  [end]
[start] Oh believe me, you are ready now. You have a compelling voice and story, AND you can write. You have many options open to you:  -Local political party organizing (My roommate has spent the past couple of years learning about how the  Brooklyn Democratic Party works, and just got elected to one of their organizing bodies. He just needed to go door to door in our neighborhood and get 50 signatures)  -Movement organizing, like with DSA or Black Lives Matter. Groups like that have lots of local chapters and they work on big campaigns, but also on the nuts and bolts of improving people’s lives now: like getting people’s taillights fixed so fewer people get pulled over. As someone who knows what it’s like to work 7 days a week and struggle to get the time/money to get a tail light fixed, this is the kind of thing I appreciate.  Groups like [FCNL](https://www.fcnl.org/updates/advocacy-teams-37) will give you free training on how to lobby Congress.  [Indivisible](https://indivisible.org) has chapters all over!  All of this stuff is volunteer, but could open doors.  Since you can write, you might consider writing up your story and pitching it around. I don’t have any experience in digital publishing so I don’t know how hard that is, but you could also self publish. Just make sure you’re using a blogging platform where you still own your content.  You are good, and you know your worth. Hold fast to it cause our country needs folks like you. [end]
[start] you arent a loser. a loser is someone who gives up when they have potential bc they dont wanna put in work. you have clearly dedicated time and effort towards something and you should be proud of that.   ps. fuck your boss for what she said. dont be discouraged OP [end]
[start] Hope OP will see this.  When things get tough just remember:  "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent."  "This too shall pass."  [end]
[start] Do not value the opinions of people whose opinions should not be valued. You are doing great.  [end]
[start] >The "minimum," she said, should be little enough that people feel ashamed to work that job  Your boss is a cunt, and that is a slippery-slope analogy.  Because you can apply "the minimum" to any non-cLevel job.  Skilled people in critical jobs such as medical and technical fields often make little more than the minimum, should they be "shamed" into becoming a doctor or engineer??  This lady is fucking stupid.  [end]
[TITLE] Last time I saw my girlfriend was early March. I spent the last two and a half months getting in shape to surprise her. She's coming back tomorrow and called me today to break up with me-- totally unexpected. I guess I don't have a reason to get in shape anymore. [TITLE]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] The best and only person to do something like this for is yourself, not anyone else, whether they appreciate you or not. Don't worry about "getting someone else", focus on yourself, keep improving, build your confidence. You will find someone else eventually, and none of this will have been for them either. [end]
[start] Your health and well-being are so much more important than any relationship. Keep up the amazing work! [end]
[start] Make this your new standard.  Do it for you. An ultimate gift to yourself.   It’s not just vanity.  It makes you more amazing and your body’s heath will flourish.  I’m a RN and when I talk about things  like this to patients, my quote is “if was a pill (self care/exercise), everyone would be on it.    Good luck.  Chin up.  Move forward. [end]
[start] I'd call it a perfect timing. Now you'll start receiving all the compliments and attention from other girls, so you will be able to fully enjoy it and flirt back. Enjoy and keep at it! [end]
[start] Be proud of your hard work, you can do this!! [end]
[start] Ha, you're literally 3 steps ahead of the game! Breakup, feel bad, revenge body! You're barking up the right tree my friend, G'luck! [end]
[start] Bro, you better keep that shit up! [end]
[start] Be proud of getting in shape.  It will help you get a better girlfriend or lots of fun until you do. [end]
[start] yeah dude, you’re looking at it all wrong, now you have even more reason to get in better shape. Get jacked, go out & bang some snow bunnies, and in no time she’s gonna be “wanting to talk & work things out” [end]
[start] You got the revenge body before the breakup! Amazing! You lost more dead weight than just body fat and I guarantee you’ll find a partner who appreciates your hard work and confidence! Blessing in disguise [end]
[start] Yeahhhh man. With someone as dedicated and positive as you, it's her loss. [end]
[start] You'll never make it if it's for a girl, but do it for yourself and you'll see greater success and happiness. [end]
[start] I’d say you have more of a reason to keep going. Be the best person you can be and show her that you’re amazing. [end]
[start] Here king, you dropped this 👑 [end]
[start] Wow, she left you at the right time!   Cut her off and let her find out the hard way.  Just disappear. [end]
[start] I’m sorry about the breakup. Love is hard. But you should be very proud of your personal accomplishments! I am proud of you! I truly believe there’s always a special someone for everyone and you will meet them. [end]
[start] Her loss bro [end]
[start] I’m so sorry. It’s probably for the best, though, if your girlfriend couldn’t be long-distance for a couple months. It was truly a test of strength when it comes to your relationship.  I’m glad that you’re in better shape, though! [end]
[start] So she dumped you and youre gonna give up on women?  Come on think of it as a bad investment and move forward. Stay in shape not for her or the next girl but for for yourself and your future wife and your future family. [end]
[start] Woah, thought I wrote this for a second. Stay safe my dude 🤙 nothing's guaranteed for better or worse. I've lost 65 pounds this year. [end]
[start] YES KING [end]
[start] You have a reason.  You are the reason.  Do it for you. [end]
[start] Lol she still hasn't seen you dude! She's gonna be feeling some remorse soon! [end]
[start] You had me in the first half.  I’m so happy you’re gonna be more motivated than ever. NEVER let a breakup define where you’ll be headed in life. I’m genuinely happy for you.   From one stranger to another. [end]
[start] Bro, you gave yourself a present. [end]
[start] This is the attitude to have.  You are setting the right example. [end]
[start] Get in shape for yourself. Love yourself before you can love others. [end]
[start] Kind of related story that is a little vain but you may find funny.   During the relationship I admittedly gained weight, like 30lb. Not saying this was okay, but it happened and my girlfriend didn’t like it. So I started working on it. She then broke up with me at a party with every single friend I had there and told me it’s because she was unattracted to me and she wanted to date “so many other cute guys”. That summer I lost 40lb, she developed an eating disorder, she begged for me back, and I got a better girlfriend.   So continue to get in shape mostly for yourself but remember there are other people to impress too if that’s your motive! [end]
[start] Yeah you do. For the next one. [end]
[start] So glad I read the text part [end]
[start] This is the part where you find an ancient martial artist master and disappear into the mountains for months and come out as Batman. [end]
[start] Wrong...do shit for you, not anyone else! You can’t tell me getting in shape didn’t feel good at face value. No one else will value you as much as you (should) value yourself. Kickass for you! You’ve already proven you can. Go be fucking awesome in life and do it for you, because you can! You’ll feel better. The rest will fall into place, guaranteed.   Break ups are fucking brutal, take all that shitty emotion and turn it into compost heap to grow a giant crop of “I am awesome’s”  You got this my dude [end]
[start] Good getting in shape!  Time to qoute the black keys  “Oh my next girl Will be nothing like my ex-girl I made mistakes back then I will never do it again Oh my next girl She will be nothing like my ex-girl It was a painful dance Now I got a second chance” [end]
[start] If your reason to get in shape is a girlfriend, then you got your priorities all wrong.  You get in shape for yourself. You are the person that you're going to see for your whole life. No girl would be the goal to get in shape. Do it for yourself, have some respect. [end]
[start] You’ll go through many girls but physical fitness is short and fleeting. Cherish it [end]
[start] IMO you got the better deal bro. Getting fit is worth being dumped! [end]
[start] Hell yeah! Right on bro! You do you, and work on bettering yourself four you and no one else. [end]
[start] Get in better shape, get a better girlfriend, one that values you [end]
[start] You are now in shape, ponder on how good you look now [end]
[start] Doing something healthwise for yourself is always a great reason. Just look, you started doing it as a surprise for your well exgf but just look at how great you feel and self confidence is a great quality. [end]
[start] I respect your mentality and your effort. You're better off, mate. [end]
[start] You continue getting into shape. Do it for yourself and your next girlfriend. Stay positive [end]
[start] Fuck yeah, man! Good for you and thank you for being an inspiration. It's sometimes really hard to work on yourself for yourself, and you kind of didn't have to do that part, but now that you're in the habit, it sounds like it's gonna be a smooth transition to taking care of you because it's the right thing to do.  Kudos. [end]
[start] They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.   Jokes apart, I’m proud of your positivity. [end]
[start] Well if you upgraded yourself...  You may as well upgrade your girlfriend  🤷🏻‍♂️ [end]
[start] Blessing in disguise my man! Now you can use your healthy body to try dating new people and it will be easier. Plus there’s the great feeling when you bump into your ex some weeks from now and you are looking 10x better then when she last saw you. Petty but damm does it feel good! [end]
[start] I read that title ready to convince you otherwise, but after reading that post, I just want to say, I'm proud of you, buddy! Keep at it, and make sure that you're doing this for YOU. Don't make your fitness something that anyone else is the sole motivation for.   Take a run and enjoy those endorphins! You've earned them! [end]
[start] Your the best reason of all to get in shape 💪🏻 [end]
[start] Ooh keep us posted!  Can’t wait to see her face when she sees how good you look. Move on [end]
[start] Time to get a hotter girlfriend [end]
[start] I really hope that you’re still going to see her tomorrow so she can see what you’ve done, not that it should make any difference to her decision but just to shove it in her face what she’s lost [end]
[start] The way I see it OP, you've already gotten a massive head start on the mental aspects of a break up.   That and you're already getting great physical shape which will obviously help you with talking with new ladies.   Good job! [end]
[start] Fucking spot on attitude dude! [end]
[start] Did something very similar - except my gf complained about my weight before. It's kinda hard making the transition to working out just for myself, so I'm glad you got that! [end]
[start] The reason is always you. You are the prize. I'm sorry for your breakup but now look at you. Her loss. Take time to find yourself and the joys of single life. You will grow and evolve. You already changed your physical body. [end]
[start] I was totally ready to come throw some support your way, but I love your attitude. Keep up the good work! [end]
[start] Youre in shape and that's something to be proud of man! [end]
[start] There are worse things than coming out of a breakup hot. I was super depressed after one breakup, accidentally ate way less and lost 20 pounds down to an ideal weight. Didn't bother getting a haircut or shaving facial hair for awhile.   Emerged from my depressed cocoon single, in shape, with a glorious mane of hair. It was a good year. [end]
[start] Yay you! [end]
[start] Oh shit friend, im really sorry. But 1) Of course you have a lot of reasons to keep in shape! Health, dopamine, stress relief, yourself, dicipline. 2) I know its really hard, but trust me that things will get better, slowly you will heal and new and better things will happen. If you need to distract yourself, pm me! [end]
[start] Umm or how about *fuck her* there are many women out there working on self improvement as well. [end]
[start] Look... I know it sucks, but you are starting new. Not just in relationship, but in many other things. Lifestyle, you are healthier, and over all you can do and be who you want and find someone who will enjoy you love and company. When you have that person you can share this you way you chose and nonf with each other. Good luck dude. [end]
[start] Revenge body is the best [end]
[start] You selfconfidence is awesome! [end]
[start] That's the spirit [end]
[start] Get in shape for you. I've been working out for 8 years, 2 long term girlfriends came and went during that time and I have gotten in increasingly better shape just for the joy of training hard and looking good for myself and I'm glad I did. Other people don't dictate my life. I would still be in great shape alone on a deserted island because I enjoy looking and feeling good. [end]
[start] Good for you mate [end]
[start] On the contrary, That’s exactly the reason to be In shape and stay in shape [end]
[start] Plenty of fish out there my dude, keep it up 💪✨ [end]
[start] I know someone probably said this already but hete goes....my first thought after seeing that last sentence you wrote in your post? Look in the mirror. That's your only reason. Now go do you. [end]
[start] Nice 👍🏼 [end]
[start] Any girl is replaceable. Also she gonna regret it once she finds out. Good on you, on not getting depressed or anything for just one girl. [end]
[start] Dude this just gives her a headstart to realize what she missed out on! [end]
[start] Keep on going! I’m cheering for you! [end]
[start] Well, join the club of sorts.  Now you have a story to tell, too.  You're certainly not alone!  Cut all ties with her.    I am glad you have got a lot of support from this post. [end]
[start] Yes! Transforming one self through discipline and hard work always ends up feeling fucking awesome and does wonders for one's self-esteem. [end]
[start] There's POF in the sea [end]
[start] That was a comeback [end]
[start] Doesn’t this mean you have your own self to be in shape for ? [end]
[start] Fuck her. Your body is a temple. You wanted to get back in shape then don't let her control your life after she left. [end]
[start] Just think about the fact that if you could get with this girl before you got in shape, you'll definitely find somebody else that's probably more attractive [end]
[start] Check out: r/startingstrength [end]
[start] I mean, think of the “revenge body” you’ll have next time you run into her! [end]
[start] Sure you do! For you! [end]
[start] You had me in the first half...from the subject line I was thinking I was going to come in here to give a pep talk.  Good job man! [end]
[start] Appreciate your positivity. Good luck with the next guy/girl/enby. Love yourself. Enjoy your life! And great work keeping up the workout routine. [end]
[start] Just to salt the wound you HAVE to send her a really hot pic of yourself. [end]
[start] Stay in shape for the next girl [end]
[start] It shouldn't be to difficult to find someone new.  And when you see your ex, make sure she realizes what dope she is. [end]
[start] Look up ways to deal with a break up, 1st one is work out and get in shape. So you are ahead of the curve! [end]
[start] Good for u having ur priorities straight my man. There’s plenty of women out there, but u only got one body and one life. [end]
[start] Dont worry bro, people are choosy and some cant handle no attention, its natural. But bro strength, a body, and health are as loyal to you as you are to it. Stay loyal to the gains and the gains will stay loyal to you. Plus if your really well in shape it helps you in bed game so keep it up. [end]
[start] This is the spirit man, keep at it, you don’t need her or anyone else to feel good, you only need those weights and your favorite Milkshake [end]
[start] When she calls and says she made a mistake and wants to make things work... that's the time you say "nah". [end]
[start] I'm proud of you friend! [end]
[start] You've shown that you don't take your SO for granted. That quality invariably shows and is attractive. [end]
[start] You got me at first, not gonna lie. But tbh to break up one day before seeing each other after two months is just wrong. Sounds like you maybe dodged a bullet. I started working out too and its great how much you feel better. [end]
[start] Bro we never had quarantine in my country bjt she ghosted me anyways despite us being together, I was working out all this time and I feel  you despite her already having a new bf now [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] Send her a new pic to really win the break up.  When she asks to meet up to talk tell her off! [end]
[start] Stay fit and healthy. Do it for you. [end]
[start] Revenge body is already well under way! [end]
[start] YOU are the reason to get in shape. You should care about your thoughts before anyone else. I am overwhelmingly sorry about what happened and I hope your heart will be better soon. I also hope you meet a girl who is more than everything you ever dreamed of and wanted and that you never forget how important you really are. [end]
[start] has us in the first half, not gonna lie [end]
[start] I'm so proud of you! [end]
[start] That's great! I've been doing the exact opposite [end]
[start] get hot. bang her sister.  go to Thanksgiving and make it awkward. [end]
[start] Her loss is not just yours but the gain of many potential new women out there when you choose to date again.   Imagine her looking back at you with your 8 pack going "damn, I fucked up there." [end]
[start] Fuck that. You improved yourself not for her, but for yourself. Once this is all over, you owe it to yourself to go out with your new self and sense of self. She'll be a distant memory and you can be happy with someone who will appreciate you. You got this man, keep up the good work. [end]
[start] You need to watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mbp0DugfCA  Honestly it's extremely true. A lot of guys have lived through it, use the pain to get in the best shape of their life, and turn their life around in a year. It's amazing. [end]
[start] Keep doing you, king. 👑 [end]
[start] I haven’t seen my boyfriend in months too and I am terrified this will happen, but honestly you are probably better off getting I shape for yourself or the next one! [end]
[start] pls i want to be this motivated but feeling like shit is my specialty [end]
[start] Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half. [end]
[start] >I'll have no problem finding someone new.  The fact that you think you need to "find" someone new shows you have a lot of inner work to do. You don't NEED a partner, it's not something to put on your to-do list like a grocery item. Happiness that depends on a relationship isn't real happiness. Just work on being as happy and healthy as you can be, enjoy every day, and let relationships develop naturally. [end]
[start] Hey, You will always have a reason to get in shape, You. You're a bad ass, go flaunt it you glorious lil peacock you! :D [end]
[start] Are you still going to see her? But on a serious note, I’m proud of you. Everything down to the attitude, to what you are doing, all the right steps. [end]
[start] hell yeah! keep at it! [end]
[start] Only get in shape for yourself [end]
[start] Read half the title, upvote, read the other half, unvote, read the body, upvote. That was a wild ride.   Congrats on getting shredded dude! I'm working on it right now and I know how much work you put into this surprise, I'm glad you still feel proud of it all! The right one is out there and she's going to love that sweet 12 pack you're rocking! [end]
[start] Inspired! :) [end]
[start] Do it for yourself man. You are fucking awesome! [end]
[start] Good for you! Lots to be proud of! [end]
[start] Keep it up for you, keep it up for the next one. [end]
[start] Just send her a shirtless photo and be like “oops I meant to send that to someone else, enjoy life!” Lol [end]
[start] Her loss! 😜 And congrats on working hard to lose weight when almost everyone is GAINING weight during the quarantine! 👋🏼 I lost about 3 lbs during SIP but now that I’m back at work, I think I’ve gained them all back. 😭 [end]
[start] How **DARE** you? You're not going to give up on being healthy because some lady decided to drop you! You're worth more than that! Your life and health is SO MUCH MORE worth than that!  Now drop and give me 20 push ups, rise and give me 20 squats, then jump and give me 10 pull ups! ♥️  Oh, and I'm here if you need to talk. [end]
[start] HEY! DO IT FOR US BRO, WE’LL LOVE YOU BRO. [end]
[start] Boy ohh boy do i wish i could see the look on her face when she sees you again and knows what she has done, her loss man, you did something great, be proud of it, and keep it up. [end]
[start] Fucking giga chad [end]
[start] congrats on the health journey and also the break up!  the question I want to know is does she even know you lost weight? I'm not insinuating that's why the break up happened. I'd absolutely love to hear a jaw dropping reaction or acknowledgment that she knows she fucked up. Haha funny how I want closure in YOUR relationship... [end]
[start] For me that post was a complete rollercoaster. I got triple whammied. First I was like omg I’m so excited, then oof hoping that it was still a good thing, and then nooo don’t quit and then omg I hate you for doing that to me! 😂I’m so proud of you dude for keeping you head held high! [end]
[start] You lost a relationship with someone who doesn’t see how awesome you are, but you gained health, good habits, discipline, better appearance, and confidence! It might be tough right now, but I have faith that with your strength and perseverance, you can get through anything [end]
[start] Nice, you lost useless weight. Its great when it sheds itself. Be sure to get some sun and ground your feet to earth this summer! [end]
[start] Hasn't seen you in months and *calls* to break up?  Sounds like she did you a favour! [end]
[start] Dude, this is your chance man! You do some angerlifting, some revengebuffing and you'll be so fucking hot you'll definitely will be able to find someone who appreciates you!    Added benefit, when your ex sees you, she'll be fucking surprised and even if she has happily moved on, wonder about it a bit.    You can't go wrong, train the sadness away, be as awesome as you can be mate! [end]
[start] Haha. Im in the same boat, lost a ton of weight during this lockdown, all for a girl who stopped caring about me. I share your pain brother, i just wish i shared your enthusiasm. Iv just been so sad about it. I havent let it stop me from getting the body iv always wanted but i just wish i could share it with her. [end]
[start] Let us know what happened when she saw you regardless! [end]
[start] You had me in the first half 😂 [end]
[start] I haven’t seen by boyfriend since February and I hope this situation won’t happen to me and him [end]
[start] A few years ago, I was un a relationship with a guy that didn't pay much attention to me. He never said ANYTHING nice about me, despite me trying hard to look good around him. I was extra motivated to go to the gym during that relationship, naively thinking that if I got into better shape, he would notice.  He never did. I realized he was a jerk and broke up with him. Came out of that relationship realizing I was in the best shape I'd ever been, and things were uphill for me afterwards. [end]
[start] The reason you get in shape is for you now. You're good enough and will find a better mate out there for you.    The more you care about yourself and stay humble you'll hopefully find a great partner.   Fucking stick in there pal your fitness is important to your health. [end]
[start] Where are the progress pics?! I love progress pics! You have a great attitude about this whole situation. [end]
[start] Almost the exact same thing happened to me a year ago. Saw her in March, next visit was may, and she broke up with me just before. I gave away a year of my life to the sorrow. I'm back on track now. I regret the last year of giving up, and I hope you don't say the same a year from now. Don't give in if you feel it creeping. [end]
[start] I don’t know you but I am proud of you! [end]
[start] Do it for yourself man, and the future babe you’ll eventually have thirsting over you. [end]
[start] Hi guys [end]
[start] yeah her loss, man, but your gain! keep it up! [end]
[start] YES BRO GET THOSE GAINS! GETCHU SOMEONE BETTER, NICER, LESS OF A DUMBASS. GAIN MUSCLES, GAIN DOPAMINE, GAIN HAPPINESS! [end]
[start] aw heck yeah [end]
[start] SAME EXACT THING happened to me recently. Good on you for continuing to better yourself despite it. [end]
[start] It’s all about you now, do what now makes you happy. [end]
[start] Fuck that cuz! Keep building yourself [end]
[start] You can surprise me 😉 [end]
[start] imagine being depressed over some XX chromosome lookin ass 😑 you’re in shape , what’s stopping u from getting another and better girlfriend [end]
[TITLE] Amazon Prime is a shake down scheme [TITLE]
[start] I'm debating getting rid of my membership. It seems like for every legitimate item that's for sale theres a dozen cheap, shitty knockoffs.   So I'm keeping it for now...the grand tour is one of my favourite shows. but the product end of the company really needs to purge the garbage listings. [end]
[start] I have noticed with Wal-Mart that there are many items that are not available with 2 day delivery. Also, when I tried to return items  to the store ( which I thought was a good reason to try their shipping) many items are through third parties and can't be returned to the store. So no net benefit as far as ease and inexpensive returns.  [end]
[start] Without prime, none of those places would have done 2 day free shipping. Amazon set the bar that everyone else is now following. You can't forget that. Walmarts website used to be an embarrassment to use for a company their size for the longest time.  [end]
[start] Bullshit. Prime shipments are marked and cost more to ship. When there is a large volume of packages, non-prime packages may be delivered the day after while prime packages will be delivered immediately.  Source: Jobbing at a shipment company. [end]
[start] I ordered an item from B&H with expedited shipping because I needed it by a specific date. Guess what, they shipped it late and used standard ground shipping.  I contacted their support and informed them I only picked them because they said they would deliver by a specific date. they did nothing and basically told me too bad. I order the item on Amazon instead and got it by the day I needed it.  B&H says they do two day shipping but they don't take it seriously. Don't use them if the delivery date is important. Maybe don't use them at all.  [end]
[start] It's not the speed, it's for the 'free' shipping. Order enough stuff, and it's worth it. [end]
[start] I tend to agree but between the video and music service AND the shipping its worth the $10/month for me. [end]
[start] I wouldn't think this is a "punishment", but rather a lack of "privilege".  Subscribing to Prime is akin to paying for any other privilege like the privilege to shop at Costco or to cut in line at Six Flags.  Like anything else, you're going to get what you pay for.   [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Nobody here seems to have mentioned that all these other businesses have two day shipping because Amazon did it first… Most places, it took a week to ship… then Amazon came along… then everyone else competed with Amazon.  [end]
[start] Do you have actual evidence they intentionally punish non-prime deliveries?  Seems like it could very well be a business decision to level load shipping - saving on employees, inventory, number of trucks/planes, etc as well as combine shipments.  That'd save money.  But I'm not sure how either of us can tell how they do it without examining their code and business processes.  Prior to prime I'd get a shipment anywhere from next day to several weeks out, so there wasn't great consistency hence I figured they optimized shipping based on many criteria.  If there is one thing Amazon knows it's data analysis and optimization. [end]
[start] If you don't pay for thing, they don't DO thing?   [end]
[start] I haven't seen anyone post an actual answer so here's how Amazon works.  For Prime orders they are fulfilled either by Amazon's warehouses or a seller that has gone through a trial period and proved themselves capable of meeting the Amazon standard. That standard is heavily enforced so Prime has a very high success rate of their 2 day window for a long list of reasons we won't get into.  Non-Prime orders are fulfilled by the seller, essentially just like eBay with a lot more red tape. These sellers do in fact get graded and are supposed to meet a standard, but they also get to tell Amazon how many days it takes them to fulfill an order. If it's some guy selling overstocked slow cookers out of his garage, he might set it so that he has 2-3 business days before he even has to put it in the mail. As long as he tells Amazon that, it's fine by them because they will factor that in to their ETA for the customer. [end]
[start] > Amazon wants to punish you for canceling your Prime membership.  TIL Netflix is punishing me by not letting me stream after I cancelled it. They actually *pre-punished* for leaving before I joined because they wouldn't let me stream then either. [end]
[start] Before anyone thinks I'm defending Amazon, I live near a hub and can say that Amazon is not a great place to work. Amazon needs to treat its employees better. With that out of the way, I think there are two *major* points you are missing here.  Your stuff will always be sent out last if you aren't paying for shipping--that's how tiered service works. More expensive services are better. They are offering to deliver something to you **for free**. You're complaining that they aren't doing a free thing any better. They are doing *exactly* what they promised you, on time, for free. And often at the same price as you'd get the item from a brick and mortar store. That is not a shakedown.  You could choose to pay extra for faster 1 or 2-day shipping from any other company, and your package would get priority in exactly the same fashion.   [end]
[start] Ummm you pay for the Prime membership to get the 2 day shipping. It's a perk and Prime members purchases get priority over non-members. How is this hard to understand? [end]
[start] $10 a month is well worth the movie service to me, honestly.  [end]
[start] I haven't seen anyone mention this but Walmart's 2 day shipping is not great, at least in my experience. I have ordered a number of things with that shipping option and I think the shortest turnaround time was like 4 days. It's more like 2 ish day shipping and several days for processing.  [end]
[start] I split it with my wife (you can link one prime membership to two accounts) so the cost is easier to swallow. I really enjoy the video content, and also use the music service as well, so I feel like it's well worth it. If it's not worth it for you, I totally get it, but you come across here like Amazon owes you something, when they don't. If you don't like the fee, there are other places to shop (like you mentioned).  [end]
[start] From the point of view of someone who used worked there for a year I can tell you a few things about what I think of prime.  One, when I shipped packages (I was in outbound) we had lights that would tell us priority, blinking red-highest, then to red, ect. Ect. With solid green being the lowest.   What you pay for is the priority over the other thousands of orders we received, and when we got busy you can guess that non-prime members are pushed to the bottom of the totem pole.   Prime also came with the priority customer service queue and free returns (a big one imo).  It's not so much so that you are treated unfairly but more so treated with a priority because you are the ones keeping amazon in business.   If you look at their prices they usually are equal if not cheaper than any other store. This means their profit margins are extremely low per shipped item and rely on pure massive quantity shipped.   If no one paid for prime, costs would be higher for both user and business raising prices. Also shipping would no longer be free due to these costs unless a large order to make up the differences.   So sure, you have to wait for items a bit longer because you have less priority but, without people paying for prime you would never have the same experience you have on the site as it is now.   I am by no means trying to advocate for Amazon as I no longer work there just trying to bring to light something's people may overlook. [end]
[start] Fuck Walmart. Amazon sucks too, but Walmart is fucking horrible. I won't give them my business.  [end]
[start] >Jeff Bezos appreciates your money.   Seems like a pretty condescending statement coming from someone who just encouraged us to give to the Walton family.  [end]
[start] r/firstworldproblems [end]
[start] It's moronic that you think the packages are sitting there for no reason. They are sitting there because they are in the queue with all the other packages and they don't get to skip ahead, that's what your paying for with Amazon prime.  [end]
[start] The Amazon market place is lowkey a nightmare. Purchasing any clothing is not only stupid because of sizing issues, but cheap Chinese market clothing has false advertising in a way that is honestly criminal, and amazon doesn't do anything about it.  Books as well, unless there from a trusted source, can have their print with 2/3 of the page being margins, and you can't do anything about it.   It's surprisingly easy for someone to get a prime vendor, and I know for a fact many of these vendors are these sketchy unreputable sources that I've mentioned. I wont source anything, just look up any clothing, and purchase some chinese brands and see for yourself.   Prime videos is okay. I like that you can rent any movie you like, but for the price of prime, not enough of it is free.  All in all, Amazon is really only so big because the government allowed Jeff Bezos to operate basically tax free while the SEC/IRS caught up with the online marketplace era (in a deliberately slow manner, from what I understand). Now that you will get taxed when shopping online, I don't see any comparative advantage for getting your stuff shipped 2 days quicker. Might as well just walk out of your house and buy it at a Target or something that day after doing some research. [end]
[start] To add to this, Amazon isn’t always the cheapest either!!!  Identical items can be found at Walmart or Target for less. Do a quick search before you purchase anything and compare. I was a fool for not doing this before.  [end]
[start] The thing is amazon is the sole reason other places have 2 day shipping.  [end]
[start] I cancelled prime because there is so much fake shit on Amazon, blatantly fake [end]
[start] OP you have it backwards. People pay for Prime to _get_ faster deliveries.  Slow delivery is for everyone else.  If you want to pay more, you can also get fast delivery.  Stop whining. [end]
[start] honestly,    unless you use their streaming   or shop at a nearby whole foods or    use amazon SNS or pantry delivery   it's not worth having prime.    i was a member since 1998   and dropped after they raised   membership over $65/yr.   [end]
[start] I don't care what anyone says, I'll pay ten bucks a month to not have to step foot in Walmart. Not only that but a magical butler delivers it to my doorstep. I know Amazon is shitty to a lot of their employees, but so is Walmart. If there's no options for me to support local because of Walmart then I'm going to go with convenience  [end]
[start] That 3-5 day wait for no apparent reason is your packages waiting for a spot on the truck. They fill the trucks with Prime packages first and then if there’s room they add yours. After a certain time limit they may have to order additional trucks to get your package out on time.   In other words with Prime you’re paying to reserve a spot on their shipping trucks. Don’t complain about the “free” service if you’re not willing to pay to get the premium service.  [end]
[start] Amazon video has the most garbage content. That's all I came here to say. [end]
[start] The price for Prime is going up soon anyway.  [end]
[start] Eh. Considering some brands of coffee bean i like aren't usually available at my local stores and i can order as late as say 11pm sometimes and still have it the next morning at no extra cost I never really regret it.  Plus they still sell plenty of name brand products at the standard price and it can save me having to run out super early or late if I'm working long hours. Plus some of the other perks though granted i rarely use them.  Its not great value for everyone but for plenty of us its a pretty fair convenience fee. With how much i order to spare me a trip but still have it next day I am content. As with all things, only pay for something when it holds enough value for YOU. [end]
[start] I just canceled Prime also.  I don't buy enough there anymore. It's a lot of cheap knockoff products. I used to love Amazon, but the allure has worn off in the last year. They have some good shows, but it's always my last choice of video service to browse.  [end]
[start] I’m not a fan of Prime either but I feel like a slave to it. First of all, they actually only send my shit within 2 days 1/2 the time.   And get this, I placed an order for 3 items which I needed the following day. No worries, all 3 were fulfilled and sold by amazon and totaled over $35 which qualified me for free next day. At check out, it split the shipment and I ended up paying $15 in shipping charges. I assumed they may have been coming from different fulfillment centers. But no, they were all delivered in the same box. Of course Amazon refunded me the shipping but it’s hard for me to not believe they do this on purpose in hopes other people won’t complain.   I can’t even trust their reviews anymore and have to make sure the majority of the 5 stars aren’t from those who “received the item for a discounted price for their review”. And let’s not even get into how their prices aren’t even always the best.   Lastly, what pissed me off the most was when I received a generous gift from Arbitrary Day on redditgifts, a sewing machine! It was shipped from Amazon’s discounted warehouse because it came without a box, no big deal! Except that trying a sewing machine for the first time is pretty intimidating and took me a few months to try it. It ended up being defective and Amazon refused to exchange it for another one no-box replacement they had in stock. I’ve been a prime member forever, I wasn’t asking for a new one, or to return it. I just wanted a working sewing machine!!   But, I’m a cord cutter so the prime price is worth the video service so I reluctantly stay.  [end]
[start] Replying to the edit. No, you're not "just saying," you are calling for Amazon to be "investigated" for not providing a free service that they are not obligated to provide. [end]
[start] It’s almost like you pay for priority shipping... [end]
[start] Millions of people shop on amazon and place orders every day. There are tons of orders to fill and so many people have prime that those prime orders stack up fast. Those ones are prioritized because the people pay for the service. All orders have the same postage so literally what is the point of amazon prime at all if they ship at the same time and have the same postage? You’re not being punished by not paying for prime, you literally just aren’t getting a service you didn’t pay for. Also with retailers like Walmart and target you have to spend at least $35 to get free two day shipping, Id rather stick with prime and get free shipping on my $7 item. [end]
[start]  That doesn’t make sense to me. Before I had Prime, Non Prime things were pretty much shipped USPS but Prime shipped orders are shipped via UPS/FedEx to where I live. Maybe it’s because I live in the middle of nowhere, but there is a difference in shipping services for me.  [end]
[start] I used to buy a lot on Amazon.  Very little now.  I need to cancel my Prime.  Thanks for posting this. [end]
[start] I cancelled my Prime membership because the last 4 orders have taken over 5 days to be delivered (yes they were specific Prime products).  [end]
[start] When my renewal is next up, I don't think I'll be choosing to stay.   The amount of times in the last year that 'next day' delivery has actually been 'some time in the next few days' with no explanation, on top of lost / late packages.   Also been burnt a couple of times with the market being flooded with cheap crap that's got 100+ paid 5* reviews.   I really can't be bothered to fakespot every item when I buy from a retailer that I'm paying a yearly subscription to.  [end]
[start] I get my money's worth. I get 5% cash back on the credit card, which more than pays for the membership. Plus I choose no-rush shipping, which adds up digital credits.  [end]
[start] Eh $120 a year is $10 a month, and I definetly watch more than $10 a month of Amazon Video. Watching the Sopranos and Oz now, finished Survivorman (so much better than man vs wild) and Peep show. Excited to start grand tour, plus the HUGE Lord of the Rings show coming out. [end]
[start] I really enjoy free two-day shipping. And the music service, and the video service. And the free cloud storage for pictures. And discounts at Whole Foods. And Amazon fresh delivery...  Wal-mart and others have two-day shipping but they don’t also have these programs as well. [end]
[start] Worked for a place that offered next day delivery for a fee, a smaller fee for 3-5 day and 5-10 days was free.  The orders were printed and processed in that order, if a next day came in it went to the front, same as if a 3-5 day order came in over a 5-10 day.  It's really not a big conspiracy.  [end]
[start] When you have prime you get priority over people who don't.  It's like a fast pass at amusement parks.  They aren't just ignoring it for 3 days, you are waiting in line.   [end]
[start] Shipping centers aren't filled with AI robots with 100% efficiency that can pick and ship your package the minute after it is placed. There is a thing called "handling" in the distribution world. People have to pick your items from a warehouse, pack the box, print out the shipping label, tape the box, and then load the box in the truck.  Sometimes there simply isn't enough resources for a company to process all these orders the same day they are placed. If a company decides they would rather let "lower priority" orders sit for a couple days and then use 3 day shipping, rather than employ more workers to reduce processing time but use 5 day shipping, there is of course a reason they are doing it that way.  They are not "punishing" non-prime members intentionally.  And these other companies are only catching up BECAUSE Amazon started it. And not even Wal-Mart can compete with the variety of products Amazon offers - not even close. [end]
[start] This sounds to me like someone who was used to calling in when their item was a day a late and demanding promos and a free year of prime and refund without returning and also more money for the inconvenience, and finally he was probably denied and he got pissed yelled at the agent and screamed he was going to go on social media and blast Amazon for “false advertisement”.  [end]
[start] Best buy has free 2 day shipping and price matching. Online and in store, check it out next time you need electronics :) [end]
[start] Boxes aren't packed by robots.  They aren't sent first class mail. [end]
[start] With the video service, audio service, free kindle books, and shipping the value is greater than any other service of its kind. Not only is the shipping free with prime items depending on where you live you can get it same day as your order. I've had plenty of items delivered less than 6 hours from my order. Plus never having to deal with Wal-Mart and thier desipicable stores are something I'll happily pay a little more for the service. My rule of is how much is my time and peace of mind worth.  [end]
[start] I work in a warehouse and we also use next day delivery for every order.   “Without prime your order sits in limbo for no apparent reason other than amazon wants to punish you for cancelling your prime membership” what a load of bollocks, actual next day deliveries are loaded onto the system on Monday for example and therefore need to be sent out on Monday as the customer has paid extra for it to be delivered the next day.   The more next day deliveries the warehouse gets, the less standard deliveries they can do each day. Therefore, creating a backlog of standard deliveries that may take 3-5 days for the warehouse to get out of their system, but once it’s completed it’s sent as a next day delivery.  [end]
[start] 120 dollars.  Netflix is 11 dollars a month, 132 dollars a year.  Let's value Amazon prime video on the low end just to offer an equitable view: let's say, worth 7 dollars a month, or 84 dollars a year.  Then there is Amazon prime photo, which has unlimited, full sized storage for uploaded photos.  Let's say there is 3 dollars of value per month, 36 per year.  Then there's a Kindle firsts book each month.  Maybe a buck per month, 12 per year.  There's amazon music too, which gives options for free streaming and downloading music, let's say that is worth a humble 4 dollars a month, 48 per year.  In our house we also share our audible and Kindle resources through the family function of Amazon prime, so we don't have to buy those items twice if we both want to enjoy them.  Let's give that an arbitrary and low value of 5 bucks per month, or 60 dollars a year.  There are several services we done use like Amazon pantry and the whole foods services, but we also use the instant savings coupons on some items that magically appear when adding items to our cart.  The services I list above, at the arbitrary prices I've listed, is 240 dollars worth a year.  This provides more than enough value and I haven't even mentioned the shipping benefits.  Even if my wife and I had our own memberships, the value would still be there for our family.  Look, you're entitled to your opinion just like everyone else but don't forget Amazon started the prime process to help dealing with the shipping problems that were created as their business model grew.  It just so happened that their prime service expanded and they kept adding services to give it value for the consumer.  Some may find value there and some may not.  But I can tell you, staggering nonmember packages is not done to punish so e people, but to efficiently deal with the problems of shipping millions of items daily.  [end]
[start] I have an Amazon credit card, and Amazon prime. It's a little steep but I like it. Amazon provide an exemplary service and when you phone up with a problem they actually fix it without having to wait on hold for 3 years and without going through a robot. The reason Amazon is the biggest online retailer is because they are the best online retailer [end]
[start] I’m sure this was already said, but I don’t want to search for it.   This is how business works... economics 101. Businesses favor those that pay more, obviously. It was a smart business move and they have made enormous amounts of money because people are willing to pay the prime price to get their stuff faster.   Better paying customers = faster service. Simple  [end]
[start] I order enough shit it's worth the price, and the prime video are nice for some shows.  The convenience is worth the price.  [end]
[start] Does Walmart resend the item when a thief steals it from my porch? The only reason I use amazon is they insure against crime and acts of God [end]
[start] For those who it just for fast and free shipping perks, it may not be worth it depending on how much you buy off AZ or how fast you need it but others use it for firestick and other subscriptions, Alexa and many more time saving instant gratification things. [end]
[start] There is more to this than just “Amazon charges for Prime while other places provide it for free.”  The only reason other places offer it free is that it’s the only way they can compete with Amazon and they are scared shitless of it being to online shopping what Google is to search. Hypothetically, if Amazon were out of the picture we would all be paying extra for that expedited shipping.   Also, you get additional perks with Prime but the value one gets varies from person to person.   And Prime is not a shakedown, get real. Amazon wants your money whether you are a Prime customer or not, but obviously they’d prefer you subscribe.   Edit: also Amazon has pretty much anything you would want to buy. No other online retailer comes close in terms of item selection.  [end]
[start] I'd bought products in the past, went to repurchase and they wouldn't let me because the item was "now only available with prime". Basically trying to force me to get a membership to continue to order the same thing😒 [end]
[start] > ...it's boxed up and shipped that same day.  Well there's you first problem; you assumed everything ships the same day (even though the checkout page clearly states when each item is expected to drop, ship and arrive).  I've just recently ordered well over 2 dozen items from AP due to the holidays and a recent move.  Some items shipped the same day, some the next day and others took a week. **But every item came with 2-day shipping once the product was ready/available.**  > Whew, so many pro-Amazon people.  Pointing out your ignorance does not make anyone else pro-Amazon. [end]
[start] Did the price increase? I thought I was paying $100. I use Amazon for other things like photo storage, music, and yes, videos. When you average it out per month it is cheaper than having Netflix, a spotify subscription, and the Samsung photo storage.  [end]
[start] I don't even use amazon services as of 6 months ago. If I order through them I just wait for my shit like it's 1999. [end]
[start] What myself and others have been experiencing recently is Prime 2-Day shipping is now taking 5 and 6 days. I called them and asked about it. I was told that the 2-day shipping is based on the day it ships, not the day it's ordered. I told her that is BS as I've had Amazon Prime for *years* and this has never been the case.    I don't use Prime for anything other than shipping, so it may be time for me to cancel. [end]
[start] I cancelled mine, and sold all of my stock when I heard about their employees pissing in bottles.. Wall streets reaction was to double their stock value..  They partnered with the Banks at the very begging to undercut and destroy the competition and run at a loss until then. A few years ago they started giving everyone massive credit ceilings.   I have about 15k worth of available credit on my Amazon store card. Helps with my credit score at least.  People ending up with +10k in amazon debt is by Design. They're the next generation of WalMart, but instead of Small Businesses, they're taking out the big Box Stores and automating the local jobs they provide, while scuttling the local sales tax. Even their white collar hiring process is weird as hell, designed for kids just out of college, and paying wages that are barely livable when adjusted to the cost of living and home prices unless you're young enough to have 1-3 room mates. [end]
[start] This poor guy. The world must be a very confusing and frustrating place for them.  [end]
[start] Good god this is dumb. You don’t pay for the service, yet think you should get the service you aren’t paying for, simply because inferior, more expensive retailers offer it for “free”? They layers of misunderstanding here are staggering. Let us know how that investigation goes. 😂 [end]
[start] I've noticed recently that sometimes I cannot order something on Amazon because I don't have prime, that certain items are Prime exclusive.  I've ordered things from someone else more than once because of this. [end]
[start] Amazon.com screwed me over on a guitar box purchase.  The Seller made me purchase 5 of them minimum but only shipped one.  Rightfully furious over being deceived, I violated their terms in my review.  My order was dropped from the system.  I don't purchase from them anymore. [end]
[start] Glad im not the only one that refuses to use Amazon.     [end]
[start] This thread didn't seem to go how you planned [end]
[start] I completely respect your opinion and you are entitled to it. Im just going to say stuff now and I may or may not make a point out of it. Amazon Prime is cool yes,even tho like you said walmart you dont have to pay extra stuff and it'll come fast. But if you do pay the $120 a year,its more than just fast shipping. You also get their music service which can have up to 10 different devices use it. It also comes with, like you said, the video service which during football season you get free footall channels (not all of them,but some of them) and you also get some hbo shows free. (The Sopranos is one example that I can think of off the top of my head) Another advantage to amazon prime is you get 1 free twitch prime per month (which gives the person you support $2.50, twitch(amazon) takes half of it),and you get some free chat emotes, a little badge by your name, and I think you get the option to change the color of your name,correct me if im wrong there. Now although that is quite a bit of things it still costs $120 a year which to me is a little overpriced,but if you guys are like me you could have 1 person in your household have amazon prime and everyone use theirs. (like me using my moms amazon prime for twitch prime,to order things sometimes,prime video,and yep,you gussed it also unlimited music) Now yes like I said I think $120 a year is to much,but thats might just be me. Final Things For Me To Say: no I do not work for amazon or any affiliates of amazon in any way, Im just a kid putting my input in, and two I am not disagreeing nor agreeing with OP in any way,like I said just putting my input in. [end]
[start] And now they make you watch ads before you get to your show/film. Really shitty when it is supposed to be 'prime'. They will inevitably introduce a tiered payment system to avoid these in the future rather than killing the ads [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I'm so spoiled by prime, I am annoyed by waiting for packages from H&M, IKEA and others for one week+. [end]
[start] no it isn't you're just being dramatic.  [end]
[start] I like AP because I'm a gamer and it gives you twitch prime for free alongside with AP. It gives you a free 4.99 subscription to use per month equalling out 59.88 through the year. TP will also give you freebies for your games throughout the year. It also gives you Prime video which is nice to have on those days you ain't got nothing to do but watch the TV. Also, the customer service of AP is very good, fast and reliable. $120 per year seems like a good deal to me. :) You just have to know how to squeeze the sauce out the packet to get the best bang for your buck out of a service. Also, if a user only buys once or twice a year and that's all they use Amazon for then yes, I wouldn't recommend AP. It's also how well it fits the consumer.   [end]
[start] I think it depends on where you live. At my campus I get discounted student prime and there's a physical amazon pickup location. I can order something and have it arrive the same day at no additional cost and without having to get in my car and go somewhere. That makes it worth it to me [end]
[start] They deliver inside my house.  No one else does that.   [end]
[start] Its easily worth it when you live in the middle of nowhere and have to pay $20 to ship anything to your house [end]
[start] Canadian here. I pay $79 CAD per year and it is so worth it. [end]
[start] My whole family of 6 uses the same account and even Video from time to time so it's worth the $10 split between us. I guess some people with untrustworthy family members wouldn't do that though lol [end]
[start] Prime member in a EU country: 49 EUR for 24h delivery (standard being 2/3 days) + primevideo. I am happy with this deal. [end]
[start] It's totally worth it to me for the discounts on books. Some of them are crazy good prices. [end]
[start] Most of the time Walmart is out of stock. I had the worst experience with their store pickup service. And they have 2 days shipping on very limited items. Besides do you have any actual proof that Amazon delays delivery without proper planning?  [end]
[start] As someone who lives on a busy street. Amazon has been a God sent with their shipment lockers. It's pretty guaranteed that if a package hits my stoop before I get home, it's gone. My neighborhood alone has 4 shipment locker sites so I can actually have stuff shipped to me that isn't stolen the minute it hits my front steps. This alone makes Amazon better than most sites that I have to specify to not leave the package at my place. 9 out of 10 times they leave the goddamn package anyway. [end]
[start] It's an efficient way to monitor, manage and budget for demand, capacity and availability. If everyone dropped prime, they probably would have to charge more across the board for products and shipping and provide a smaller variety of products.  Amazon set the stage for other companies to jump on board with their model, which has probably compromised the value provided by the original prime membership and contributed to Amazon continually adding extra included features to retain a reasonably predictible revenue stream which then helps them continue offering the service at a consistent annual cost to consumers.  But one of the perks is that member demand gets priority over non-member requests. The members are likely to be repeat users and non-members may be more likely to order once from Amazon for a specific need and one time benefit but otherwise take their business elsewhere. So it's in Amazon's and their members' best interests to make sure member requests get fulfilled first.   Aside from that, prime items are the ones sitting in the warehouse ready to grab, pack, and load on a truck.   Also, typically I can find quality or brand name items on Amazon prime that I can't find at Wal-Mart. Macy's gets most of my wardrobe business because I can get decent stuff with free shipping because of my reward level with them. But they have the added benefit of a brick and mortar store if I need it...like Wal-Mart. However, it probably won't be long before we only have Wal mart, target and high end big city boutiques to walk into...you can thank Amazon for helping speed up that trend too...    [end]
[start] This literally just happened to me! [end]
[start] To me, I'm also paying for that customer service.  I was supposed to have 2 items delivered yesterday, for some reason they got confused by the front gate, so I got a failed delivery notice.  I called customer service and they had my packages back on a truck and delivered a few hours later.  For me, that is worth 120 a year.  [end]
[start] Yea fuck Amazon! [end]
[start] A lot of the products on amazon are a scam  [end]
[start] Even though the UI on Instant Video is ass, having the streaming selection and music streaming service makes the $120/year worth it. Basically $10 a month for those services plus the added bonus of 2 day shipping isn’t a bad deal in my eyes.  [end]
[start] So your argument is amazon just makes packages sit around for no reason other than to punish you.  And your reason for this argument is Walmart offers two day shipping?  Tinfoil hat much?  [end]
[start] Mate, it's a value added service. It's like you saying, I pay for internet, it goes through the same cable so I should have the fastest speed, might as well have dial up a connection.  Yeah.  The reason we (I dont work for amazon, mean logistics in general), do this is also because "it" helps with getting the stock, if some customers are okay with an extended lead time that's fine, because it reduces pressure, and also minimises the stress on the system.  I dont have to order the thing you want until whenever its convenient for Amazon to do it, which means I'm utilising warehouse space extremely well and saving  a bunch of stipper dollars for Bezos.   Most expensive part of logistics is the last mile, meaning getting the parcels out individually to your entitled consumer self, mean that nicely. It's good because I can plan better for this consolidation to go with others who dont neccesarily want their goods on the same day.    Learn something new everyday.     [end]
[start] I don’t have prime, and not a huge fan of Amazon in general, but this is really faulty logic. I’ve gotten things from Amazon not through prime and they’ve arrived in 2-3 days, much earlier than expected.  I’m assuming “prime” gets priority.  So when you order something it’s not the “same robots packaging it then having it hang in limbo”, I’m assuming it’s more like if someone can pack 10 boxes, the ones that need to go out that day get packed first.  So if you’ve got ten prime packages, the non prime order will sit. But if you’ve only got 8 prime orders and 2 non prime the non prime will get packaged up.  In terms of other stores they usually have a lower selection and many high-demand items are “in store only”  I really don’t get this post.  Seems like you canceled a service that sped up your shipping and now you’re annoyed your shipping isn’t fast. [end]
[start] But you can still get 2 day shipping without prime? The only difference is that it’s free with prime. [end]
[start] Fuck Jeff Bezos [end]
[start] As a Walmart employee who works pick up in a local store... their 2 day shipping is hardly ever 2 days.... and they don’t have sweet shows to watch [end]
[start] Exactly why I don’t feel bad for making a new account for a free month each time. [end]
[start] It doesn't even work as you described with Prime anymore. Back when I first became a member, it cost 70 bucks a year and my item would be at my house in 2 days or even less every time. Now, when they have 2 warehouses within 10 miles of my house, I'm lucky if it's 4 days. Their customer service used to be okay but now, when you complain about late packages they just give you bullshit excuses. Last time they told me, after it took almost 2 weeks for an item to arrive, that the 2 day guarantee is 2 days AFTER they ship it. If they just sit on the order for a week, then the 2 days hasn't started yet.  &#x200B;  My subscription is up next month and I'm pretty sure I'm not going to renew. [end]
[start] Living in Hawaii, free shipping has saved me so much money.  [end]
[start] I have prime and use it for many of its features frequently and by being a student I get 50% off the annual subscription, so it's honestly an easy choice for me [end]
[start] Wait, Amazon prime costs 120$ in US? [end]
[start] I like it for Prime Now groceries within 2 hours from Whole Foods [end]
[start] Prime isn't just two day shipping. A lot of times it is next day for me. [end]
[start] But free the amazon prime that comes with being a college student is very nice. [end]
[start] With Prime they only promise 2 day shipping not boxing it up and actually shipping it same or in 2 days.   Now a days it take 3-4 days to enter the shipping phase before the 2 day shipping clock starts.   I order a lot and spoke with support numerous times about In-Stock / Prime items taking upwards of 5-7 days to even ship out. They said the 2 day was only for once it’s actually been shipped.  [end]
[start] I personally pay for prime so I can use the video portion like Netflix while still benefiting from the shilling. I canceled Netflix when they doubled their subscription fee over the last 6 years  [end]
[start] But did you know you can sub to me with twitch prime.... [end]
[start] Free next day shipping vs non-free or - minimum amount of money spent to be free-two day shipping are far from being the same.  [end]
[start] I mean, the reason Walmart and other sites now do this for free is because of prime's 2 day shipping. They needed to be able to compete.  [end]
[start] I ordered something from Walmart.com and it came in an Amazon box. Still haven’t quite figured that out. LOL [end]
[start] First off,   I believe you.   Also,   Amazon is SUB Prime for failing to stop all the awful knock-offs and illegal goods sold on there.   Finally,   I have seen with more than one friend --as well as with myself -- that Amazon does a few other tiny but obviously shady things.    Hey,  it's big business.   Corporations (at least in America)   are shady and they keep getting away with it.   Why should Amazon not be as bad as Walmart?   So disgusting. [end]
[start] I made a business out of the profit margins between items priced from merchant fulfilled Sellers and FBA which primarily target prime members. If you have prime you are probably paying more for an item plus your prime membership and only getting the item a day faster depending on what time of day you purchase the item from an FBA seller. No matter what, the item is sitting in an Amazon fulfillment center and isn't processed any faster. [end]
[start] Amazon is more akin to eBay these days.  I canceled prime as well.  [end]
[start] OH MY GOD, CUSTOMERS WHO PAY FOR FASTER SERVICE ARE SERVED FASTER?! [end]
[start] Yeah, my only reason for maintaining it is for older or more obscure tech stuff with the alternative being Ebay, which I especially don't trust. But I have prime, and the last prime item i ordered did sit for 3-5 days before being shipped and was supposed to arrive yesterday when i ordered it two weeks ago? But i pay for it? What the fuck. So I'm here to complain too tbh. [end]
[start] I terminated prime today. I signed up originally with a student discount for 2 years which expired a couple years ago. I like amazon but I only use prime shipping, and its been recently getting less reliable. Several instances I order something and it takes longer than 2 days. Sometimes much longer.  [end]
[start] I’ve never had prime and it’s always been that way for me where my order sits for 3-5 days before it ships  [end]
[start] Oooo let me join in on this discussion. OP YOU A DUMBASS [end]
[start] People get Amazon Prime because of the slightly faster delivery?  [end]
[start] Lol "The market will choose".  The market is currently choosing and has been choosing AMZN for decades.   It's certainly not choosing your paid/bot advertising special interest hearsay. Look at the numbers.    [end]
[start] I dont even have prime for the shipping. I have it for all the other perks. Costs pretty much the same per year as netflix or hulu,  but you get so mich more than just movies/tv [end]
[start] I get where you're coming from and I totally agree. In a place like India however, Prime and same day shipping can be extremely convinient. Also, Prime video is really good at providing a platform for local artists to do well by making their stuff accessible and by increasing their viewership. In most first world countries its probably a good idea to weigh your options.  [end]
[start] not to mention they are working their workers to death. Relying on old people who live in their trailers. Putting physical demands on them. It is fucked up.  There is a documentary about this.   Yep, Amazon is a giant because they fuck people over.   Sadly that seems to be the way the world works. In order for you to gain, someone has to lose.  [end]
[start] Amazon is a nicely polished turd.  [end]
[start] First off, I am a prime member, and I'm thinking of getting rid of it. Lately I've noticed my orders (even when prime eligible) are taking about a week to ship, when last year they shipped same day. Not worth my money anymore. Don't really like the company itself much either.  [end]
[start] "Amazon is punishing me by giving me standard service when i cancel my premium service"  ... Wait.. what [end]
[start] The way they has changed selling stinks too.  [end]
[start] Lmao. That's not fully how it works. There are reasons people use prime other than the 2 day shipping.  You cannot find nearly half of the things you can on Walmart compared to Amazon.   There are many small ma and pa shops like our own that use Amazon to fulfill, but guess what? Walmart does have our products. Target doesn't have out products.  And from a consumer standpoint, it is better to shop in one central location, rather than on the multitude of the sites that you would have to enter your credit card info into.  Lastly, you mentioned it just sits in limbo. No it doesnt. Prime members get priority over non. That means that even though you ordered first, every prime order that comes in over the next couple days will be processed before yours.  And they are receiving thousands of orders per hour. While Walmart online is receiving dozens. Walmart can afford to ship out all orders immediately. Amazon cant. [end]
[start] I live very close to an Amazon fulfillment center, and I think they often use a lot of Uber-type delivery contractors instead of going through a mail sorting facility.  I know damn well they can get me my package the same day, but they occasionally they will wait a few days before pulling my order just to try to get me to go Prime. [end]
[start] Eh, I find it to be pretty worth it.   The convience and selection is unmatched, and the video service is the Pepsi to Netflix’s coke.   Maybe if you’re counting every penny there are better deals, but to be honest $120 a year is nothing to me, and I’m far from the top 1%.    [end]
[start] Investigated? Lol, by whom? Just shop elsewhere, and stop expecting the government to hold your hand through life.   I just cancelled my cable, and now I can't get any channels. Someone investigate!   I just cancelled my electricity, and now my lights won't turn on. Someone investigate!  [end]
[start] recently priced a bougie hairspray... amazon wanted $38...walmart, same product/size $21.   yo amazon/jeff, you think we can't comparison shop? [end]
[start] >getting "punished" for canceling a service should be investigated.  You sound like an entitled brat. [end]
[start] OP your post sounds very entitled. You don't need to use Amazon. No one is punishing you. [end]
[start] was my experience as well, Amazon prime is a scam  [end]
[start] This post gives no evidence of this shit lol, wow who would’ve thought people who paid for 2 day shipping via prime got their package faster than those who didn’t.  [end]
[start] I worked at amazon....no idea where the robots are [end]
[start] No shit, dumb ass. It's called paying more for a premium service. [end]
[start] I pay 5€/month for prime and I mostly like the promos it offers [end]
[start] A pop up came on my screen saying I’m eligible for Amazon student so I get 50% off Prime. That was a couple of months ago, I left Uni over a year ago...  [end]
[start] All I gotta say is most people are Amazon fan boys. So a lot of the things you hear will definitely be biased. I used to love Amazon until I started realizing that they're the only company that gave me any trouble when ordering online.   Customer service is trash for example. Any other company I felt was eager to fix my problems but Amazon literally took away the ability for their out sourced customer service employees to help me. I can only imagine Amazon did that because hopefully I would just deal with my problems rather than try harder to get my money back.  Anyway, yeah Amazon sucks. Last place I'll shop at over all the better options.  [end]
[start] >getting "punished" for canceling a service should be investigated  lol you've got to be kidding me. How can your post accurately point out that the market will choose what to put up with but then claim that Amazon should be investigated for running their business a certain way? [end]
[start] You’re going to complain that your  punishment for not paying is not getting a paid service? Really dude?  [end]
[start] Cancelled it, don't need anything I order online and if I do I can take the 15 minutes to pick it up at the store. Waste of money. [end]
[start] you're free to shop elsewhere if you don't like the service, that's the beauty of capitalism  [end]
[start] Well the reason your product just "sits there" is because of the million other products they're still trying to send out from customers who have already ordered and are waiting. Prime just puts you to the front of that line.  I find it hilarious you use the word punish. You're paying for 2 day shipping with prime and if you cancel your payment for it you think that's a punishment? YOU CANCELLED. Punishing you would be not allowing you to shop on amazon or something. This is just regular business. [end]
[start] It's not a shakedown, it's a pretty standard SLA. You get your items prioritized based on the prime membership because you're paying for a higher degree of service.  Walmart and other retailers offer this as their standard level but let's say the package is late or damaged, what is Walmart policy there? I've had tons of partial refunds or been told to keep the item while they immediately ship a new on when using prime. Not sure Walmart would do that.  Plus other perks like the streaming music and TV are included which other retailers don't have.   I think you're misunderstanding that prime is a service where they promise you to get you the item within a window (weather and acts of dog withheld) and when they don't they will compensate you. Every service industry has these SLAs.  Besides, nobody in the warehouse is saying lets leave these non-prime orders for next week cuz they stopped paying for prime. They're merely prioritizing the prime deliveries because they have to meet those timelines [end]
[start] Not my experience. I cancelled Prime, ordered something a week later that should have been 3-5 day shipping and it arrived in 24 hours.  [end]
[start] This doesn’t make a lick of sense. It costs more money to ship in 2 days via a carrier like UPS than it does to do regular shipping via USPS. Even with prime, you can select slower shipping for small bonuses. Just because other retailers do 2 day shipping now doesn’t mean older shipping methods don’t still exist (and are cheaper). Fucking duh.   But keep your head in whatever bubble you’ve created for yourself. The people here calling out your stupidity are clearly just “Amazon Fans” /s.  [end]
[start] Totally get not wanting to support tax evaders and conglomerates.  I ditched apple products 2 years ago because they intentionally make you spend more on their products that all go to shit in two years due to updates.  Samsung phones are just as good, PCs have more storage space, and roku is far better than apple TV for a fraction of the cost.  You do give some things up like convenient group texting, facetime, iMessage via wifi, camera quality etc but those things weren't huge to me.    Amazon, however, is so worth it to me.  I run a small business and order at least 3 deliveries a week. Would I rather support another small business? Of course! But I have to think about convenience and my bottom line first and Amazon just has it down.  Their platform is easy.  They have all my info.  It's a two click situation that I just love.  I even use Amazon music for our lobby music.   More power to you though! And I'm so glad other companies have followed with the quick shipping options.  [end]
[start] They've started reducing customer access by having some popular products only available to prime customers. This isn't "if you have prime this costs less" it's "you can only buy this if you're prime."   Went to buy a toy for my niece but it was blocked. Walmart has it for the same price. What's the point? I don't buy anything unless i have enough to pass the free shipping threshold. Then i get it within a few days anyway. Prime is pointless, and if they start slowing shipping times to punish non prime customers it's extremely easy to go somewhere else.  I would've bought all my Christmas stuff from Amazon if a) product availability was better in Canada, b) prices were better and c) this stupid prime shit wasn't in place. Every time i make purchases i move further from using Amazon as my sole source of online shopping. I don't mind that at all. [end]
[start] Agreed.  I've had prime for the past three years but I'm not going to resubscribe.  Almost half of my "Prime" orders estimate a week to deliver, I've never had this happen my first two years even in the busy season.  A complete joke I pay this much money when I could get the same items with free shipping without an exclusive membership. [end]
[start] This is my experience as well: without Prime orders/packages sit in the queue for several days. Moreover, some items have good prices only if you have Prime. I would gladly pay for Prime if it was somehow usable to me in my country (Cyprus, EU), but it literally gives me nothing of value and thus is difficult to justify.  [end]
[start] You’re wrong 😒 you’re just angry [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I feel the same way. I barely use amazon anymore. [end]
[start] In short: OP doesn't know what actually goes into their shipping and confuses a priority queue as punishment. [end]
[start] I like the streaming service [end]
[start] Axed my prime this year actually, feels great. [end]
[start] Wrong. Walmart has a minimum order price limit for their free shipping. There are exceptions but it generally the case. Amazon is reliable and fast. Until that starts to suffer, I'm not changing. I use their cloud services and music services also. As well as Alexa devices. They have a quality product. If this is your way of protesting the strike in the UK, then I laugh at this feeble attempt [end]
[start] It's worth it in the UK, you get next day delivery on anything order before 6pm [end]
[start] It’s the same with municipal mail in most counties which have first and second class mail. All mail is first class until a certain point where it gets held back.  [end]
[start] That's marketing prime has its pros and cons. With pros being books, delivery time (in my country), music etc cons being shitty stream service etc. Its dirt cheap anyway the yearly membership, they just force us to buy it so that they can be in business even when we aren't buying. Jeff isn't the richest man by fluke mate. [end]
[start] Besides b&h and walmart, can you please tell me other companies that ship 2 day free?. I am also fed up with amazon but they have good deals on things I need. [end]
[start] I get what you're saying, but I've always thought of prime as a video service with time of other perks, not a delivery service with video perks etc. That said, if I didn't have prime I wouldn't order from Amazon either. [end]
[start] Good post.  You may not have known this (I don’t know how young you are), but before amazon nowhere did that. Amazon pioneered the quick shipping for free (I get it, not totally free).  And many people remain loyal for that reason.   Good for the market to adapt.  [end]
[start] Where I live, sometimes the package gets delivered early without prime. Sometimes it comes on the last possible day.  For me at least I don't think my package just sits somewhere [end]
[start] I used to work on the warehouse systems for a billion dollar fashion company. Whilst I don’t doubt Amazon do exactly what you say, I would expect they have a priority scheduling service that like ours, understands the flights and truck arrival times, as a well as time to reach a specific postcode by each delivery service. Upgrading late shipments from ground to air to make them arrive on time, shunting staff orders and non-prime members for prime members does seem “fair play” when they’re busy. Even just shunting big spenders for small spenders is normal. Having said that, I’m sure a late package acts like a reminder to redo your amazon prime so I would also guess they do that too. [end]
[start] I'm planning on cancelling simply based on the fact they've swapped from Fedex/DHL to hired on prime delivery guys.  I feel really bad for these guys as it seems they're given very little instruction when hired; but when they miss my house more than half the time, and it takes 3 delivery attempts over the course of a week to get a package, I might as well switch to mail. [end]
[start] Now that there is a distribution center in my city I have received things same day. Plus video, music, books, and I get a bonus of 2 day shipping.  [end]
[start] You say a company is intentionally reducing the capability of its normal service to charge additional fees for a so called "premium service!?" Hurumph! Why my feathers are most certainly ruffled now! This is unheard of, I will be sending a sternly worded letter by post to my local representative to rectify this injustice. There is no room in a just society for such shady business practices in this fine year of our lord, 1835.  [end]
[start] Jokes on them I've had Amazon Prime free for over 18 months from the various colleges I've transferred from. [end]
[start] I order from Amazon like, twice a year... when I do, it was shipped out same day.  Even still, I don't want to pay to have something sent to me ASAP. If I want it I'll go out and buy it [end]
[start] I ordered something this week but went with the later shipment because I was going to be out of town and it was still delivered in 2 days.  [end]
[start] I'm far from an expert, but I learned differently from this video: https://youtu.be/5HOijUtExiM  [end]
[start] I've never had prime, but have been a customer for a long time. They sit on my orders too... [end]
[start] As multiple people have mentioned already, this is simply called competition. Those retailers did not originally offer 2 day free shipping, and some are doing it only during the holiday season.  A good example is Best Buy’s program called ‘Gamers Club Unlocked’ which was a paid membership that gave you 20% off all video games. Amazon eventually added it into their Prime benefits which stole a lot of Best Buy’s traffic. Best Buy eventually cancelled the program because it didn’t work out and then **Amazon quickly pulled theirs as well**. Literally only existed because of competition. [end]
[start] I honestly wouldn't have a membership if it wasn't half off. But it's $5 a month and I usually order 1-2 items from there, as well as watch prime tv. For that it's worth it to me.  [end]
[start] Prime video comes in handy sometimes.  [end]
[start] You are absolutely right. And at this point I would say anyone still using prime solely for two day shipping is wasting their money; however, Amazon prime offers so much more than two day shipping that it still is worth the price tag. I've found better deals on prime day than I did on Black Friday the last two years. Between Twitter Prime, Amazon Music, Amazon Video, Prime Exclusive Deals, etc. It is well worth the price. [end]
[start] i don't really care about the two day shipping but the FREE shipping is great. i order a lot and the shipping rates would add too much to the cost....and the videos are worth something. [end]
[start] Prime Video has all 6 seasons of the Sopranos  [end]
[start] 2 kids. Prime now is heaven. [end]
[start] Because Jeff Bezos is slightly less evil than the Waltons. [end]
[start] I respect your opinion, and I think that there are probably many people that would agree with you. I don't consider myself pro-Amazon, and I'm not particularly a fan of Jeff Bezos either. Instead, I'm a fan of getting the best product that I can afford as quickly as possible (In my location, it's either same-day or next-day delivery), delivered for free. I disagree with the notion that Amazon Prime is a 'shake down scheme' because that would imply that everyone is required to subscribe to Amazon Prime, and that subscribers are not getting any value for what they have paid for. I think many ISPs (e.g., Spectrum, formerly Time Warner Cable) fits into the shake down category because many consumers don't have any other viable options other than the major ISP in their area. For example, in many areas of Texas, while ATT and some smaller ISPs are options that consumers are free to choose, Spectrum is the only provider selling 100mb + packages at a reasonable price. All of the other providers, including ATT, are either completely blocked (by local bureaucrats, or regulations that they created) from entering consumers' service location, or the service these other providers offer is extremely inferior and sold at a much higher cost.   &nbsp;   I think that what you say you've experienced since cancelling your prime membership actually proves the opposite of what you claim.  I think it's fair to say that Amazon Prime members expect to receive a superior value-one in excess of that normally received-over those who don't subscribe. Why would anyone subscribe to Prime if they didn't want same-day or next-day service?  The thing that finally convinced me to get a Prime membership was the fast delivery service.   &nbsp;   As for competitors of Amazon that also offer free delivery without charging the buyer for a membership, have you already tried comparing the cost of products offered by these competitors against the cost of products that you see on Amazon? If you've already done this and found the same products at a lower cost being sold by an Amazon competitor, then buy from the competitor. The only way consumers get to cast their 'vote' for a company's products or services is by choosing/not choosing to spend their dollars there. Currently, many are voting for Amazon (myself included). That said, as soon as another competitor offers something better than Amazon Prime, I'll gladly spend my money there instead. I wouldn't hesitate one bit.  [end]
[start] > The market will choose, and I choose to shop elsewhere, Amazon.  I've done the same thing.  I removed my credit card info from Amazon.  The only reason I haven't deleted my account (can we do that?) is that I bought some TV show episodes years ago.    I avoid Walmart as well, but I haven't had too many issues with getting stuff I want. [end]
[start] And when you search for items on Amazon, only the prime shipping items are listed first. You have to keep going down through the pages to find the item with free shipping that ISN'T prime. Oh and you'll have to spend more to qualify for free shipping. [end]
[start] That hasn't been my experience at all. Perhaps it is the items ordered? I'm not saying you are crazy, just that I've ordered stuff for work where we don't have a Prime account and haven't noticed things just sitting like that. [end]
[start] I finally broke down and bought Prime for their video streaming, which I greatly enjoy. Sometimes faster delivery that they don't charge me for is an okay benefit. [end]
[start] You're kind of paying for the customer service as well. Anytime I've had even the smallest issue with an order it's been completely refunded or I've been given something of equal monetary value, with literally no hassle. Never had that experience with any other online retailer.  [end]
[start] Me and my wife both had prime, now we just have one prime.. she still gets the 2 day or I do, I forget who cancelled. So no punishment there at least. [end]
[start] r/unpopularopinion [end]
[start] AP is 60€ here in glorious Germany and it features free evening express for many items.  [end]
[start] It's going to turn into one of those old tv schemes where you can order a shitload of music cds for $1 or whatever but you have to sign up for a monthly subscription that's hard to cancel. Enough people just forget to and throw away a ton of money for it to be profitable without actually providing a product. [end]
[start] What about people like me that switched from buying physical games at GameStop to Amazon? Certain games that are brand new are like $60 or more. I can get a AAA game the day it's out sometimes for $50. I remember last time someone said prime is a scam here unless you're buying a certain amount of things. So like I still have a handful of games like KH3 and smash ultimate and bayo 3 along with spider Man that already came out. [end]
[start] It's called Prime for a reason. The regular service is as you describe. You order something anders it sits in a warehouse for a few days while the buyers who paid for fast shipping get sent out first. [end]

[start] This gave me the feels. [end]
[start] That very cool of him [end]
[start] This is soo sweet 😍 [end]
[start] that’s amazing and beautiful, hope she says yes and they have a wonderful marriage! [end]
[start] such a misogynist cultural tradition [end]
[start] Omg happy tears! How incredibly sweet!!! [end]
[start] Love it. [end]
[start] He is a stand up guy.  Love this. [end]
[start] Solid. It’s small stuff people consider trivial that hits closest to home. [end]
[start] Class act is right! Blessings on the couple and on your family! Inspiring. [end]
[start] I am not in a great mood today,but this helped brighten it! [end]
[start] Ahh that got me in the feels! Congratulations to them. [end]
[start] Good man. [end]
[start] I'm very glad for all of you guys, your sister probably has a great man by her side and you are about to acquire a great brother. I'm sorry for the loss of your father but wherever he is, I bet he's happy about this and giving his blessing for it too.  Congratulations and take care. :) [end]
[start] I read that your sister's boyfriend called to give you his blessing to marry her.  I understand now though, congratulations that must feel really nice. [end]
[start] That is absolutely amazing. This makes me tear up. (': [end]
[start] that is soo awesome. what a loving thing to do. [end]
[start] Gentleman [end]
[start] This made me teary eyed [end]
[start] Now all he needs is her to say yes.             Comments section wish the dude luck [end]
[start] Definitely what I would have done the same thing he is a keeper best wishes to all of u and a happy Easter [end]
[start] Good Dude. [end]
[start] So beautiful. Happiness and blessings to all of you! [end]
[start] What a class act this future brother in law is! [end]
[start] This is amazing ❤️ [end]
[start] That's so kind [end]
[start] Beautiful gesture. Best wishes to the fam :) [end]
[start] Hell. Yes. [end]
[start] I'm not crying, my eyes are just sweaty.   Seriously that's an incredible gesture, and I wish your family all the best. [end]
[start] That’s a solid dude [end]
[start] Awesome all around!!! [end]
[start] This didn’t melt my heart, it turned it straight to gas [end]
[start] Sounds like he will be a great asset to your family. [end]
[start] Perfect. A good move. Nicely done, my lad. [end]
[start] That is so sweet. God bless, and I hope your Easter was lovely. [end]
[start] Awesomeness all around. [end]
[start] [THIS](https://youtu.be/c1Ckte-hG44) is a true class act of brothers stepping in in the absence of the father of the bride. [end]
[start] Actual tears reading this. SO SWEET. [end]
[start] Why have a best man? God mother God parents? Captain of a team? Heck why even have a leader? That’s the point if all this. Someone stepping up and making it better for the couple. Idiots reading into all the stuff this say is stupid or archaic are morons. It’s a tradition and someone stood up to it. Those who have negative things to say about this have never had a leader in front  of them. [end]
[start] Oh shit this is awesome!!! It’s incredible how loss can change someone and sometimes bring people together. [end]
[start] Man, that’s strong. Good for him. Good for you. He recognized how important you are in your sisters life. Blessings to all. [end]
[start] So your sister is not a feminist. [end]
[start] Beautiful he has respect and manners [end]
[start] Is her mother in the picture? [end]
[start] Not your mom? [end]
[start] Creepy [end]
[start] ...okay? [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] This fucking rules. [end]
[start] Hmmm. [end]
[TITLE] I’m a Norwegian and I’ve been completely unaffected by Trump, yet I cry tears of happiness for America winning the election. Congratulations on winning your land, credibility and dignity back! [TITLE]
[start] I, too, not an American. But an Australian, got quite emotional and felt a huge relief and hope when I found out about Biden winning. I stopped myself from shedding tears of happiness as I was around people lol. But damn, this is great fucking news. I now see hope and major progress for the US [end]
[start] Thank you so much! I’ve been in tears the past few days & anxious over this election. Now, I’ve been crying tears of relief that Biden won. You are the second person from another country to congratulate us over this historic moment. Thank you for your support. ❤️ [end]
[start] I'm sure ppl all over the world are breathing a sigh of relief thinking that America came back to it's senses. It was a close race. There is still an overwhelming population of bigoted, backwards, gun-toting, climate change denying, science hating, misogynistic people here. That hasn't changed so please don't stop praying and sending positive thoughts. Trump isn't going to concede easily. [end]
[start] Thank you so much <3!!! I am an immigrant in this country who couldn't partake in the election but this country is my home and this election made me cry. It's so nice to hear people from other countries also feeling happy for us. Bless you <3. [end]
[start] I was just messaging with my cousin who’s in Oslo. He cried with me when we found out Biden won. I’m sending him a boat load of American candy and he’s going to send me chocolate [end]
[start] Thank you. There are still a bunch of Trumpists with rifles demonstrating here and there.  Trump could still be a factor after he leaves office, but he might have his hands full due to criminal indictments from the state of New York. They are getting his financial records and will undoubtedly find many instances of tax fraud and bank fraud.  He is done for, but it will take some time. [end]
[start] The fact of seeing other counties proud of a candidate winning the election over Trump should speak to those who voted for him. He wasn't in it for Americans but for himself and himself alone. His 4 years destroyed so many good world relationships America had worked for and I hope we can get back to joining in the good the world is working toward. Its not easy work at all, but together we are working toward progress. [end]
[start] Thank you we have much to gain back there are good people here yet [end]
[start] Denmark are with you on this as well! [end]
[start] Reading all the things trump and his crazy-driven cunts makes me happy, even as a russian. Oh, and also russia now has someone new to blame our problems [end]
[start] I'm not American, but I feel glad that Biden won. Also congrats to Kamala for becoming the first female vice-president! [end]
[start] Thanks,chum! I'm still deeply ashamed of how close it was. There is so much work to do. Cheers! [end]
[start] Irish here, I've always been disgusted by the trump administration, and was so so happy to hear he's out. I didn't know i'd end up sobbing during bidens speech. The heart feels a lot lighter knowing there's one less fascist psycho in the highest office. For the first time since 2016, with trump and Brexit, it feel like there's some hope, rather than anger, hate and bigotry.   I love you Americans and I'm so excited to see you heal [end]
[start] Thank you so much.  It means so much to so many of us to know that we still have friends all over the world.  No matter what we are all humans together. [end]
[start] I am not going to lie. This last year has been rough on me mentally.I retired, family illness, personal injury, basically staying home. Today was the first day l havent felt numb. I even cleaned house a little. Baby steps. [end]
[start] In Scotland I was relieved and elated because of the large role US has in climate change, and it has given me hope again. [end]
[start] Thank you. It means a lot.   We are working on it. I would like us to be part of a better world, not fighting with it. [end]
[start] Thank you! I hope our relationship with our friends across the globe can begin to heal a little. [end]
[start] Thank you Norwegian friend, I hope to visit your country someday [end]
[start] Thank you. As much as I hated voting between two white old christian men, we got the best option we could. As a human, I care deeply about my fellow people, my planet, and my future, and I am glad that we have someone who will look at the science and at least doesn't view people like me as nonpeople. I have some small shred of hope now for the future, both for my country and my world. It should always be world first, since we are all on this spinning blue dot together, alone so far amongst the stars. We need to be in it together. [end]
[start] Uk here. Wonderful news! [end]
[start] I am an American. A muslim, an immigrant, and a woman. This guy probably didn't want me having any rights. I cried tears of joy all morning. You should search "van jones reacts to biden win" on youtube. He is a CNN anchor and he really explains why it was so emotional. [end]
[start] FYI Some of my students (I teach high school English in Switzerland) have - in classroom discussions - expressed positive opinions on Trump, and I assume that will come from what they hear in their homes.  And just this week I was talking to a well-educated friend with a science degree, asking her what she thought of the election thriller playing out in the US, and I was shocked to hear she was on Trump‘s side, arguing that his economic policies are better than those of the democrats. I was gobsmacked. So I have unfortunately met people outside the US who find no fail with Trump... [end]
[start] You're not unaffected. Despite the mess the US is in, it's still the largest global superpower by quite a margin.  Many, many countries need to maintain international relations, investment, trade, import and export of goods and culture with the US. When they're a superpower, those things are important.  The US having a leader that isn't an infantile, narcissistic pseudofascist is in the interests of the planet, not just the US. We're only really separated by water, and that's easily traversed. [end]
[start] As an Israeli, Trump did affect my country, for the better. I'd even go as far as to say he was the best US President for Israel, ever. But looking at what has been happening in America under him, in the country that he is *actually* supposed to care about, made be root hard for Biden, and I was so releived and happy when he was finally called the winner. [end]
[start] I mean, I do get your sentiment, but considering the 70 million or so votes that Trump still got I'd say they have a long way to go to win back their country, credibility and dignity. [end]
[start] American. I'm not crying because in reality there's a lot of work to do, but at least i can take a deep breath, and know that we finally got our country back and were not hurtling full speed towards the edge of a cliff anymore [end]
[start] Yeah but the real problem is that half the country was willing to elect that fucking disaster (trump) and I don't think anyone knows how to deal with that. [end]
[start] That’s empathy and it’s what was missing in the US the last four years... [end]
[start] Tusen takk.  ❤️🤗🎉 [end]
[start] I can only say, jeg elsker deg, tusen tak” in Norwegian, but America needs support and positive energy right now. So many votes for him and those people are to be won by example and kindness. So a whole lot of tak lol [end]
[start] Uuhh who the POTUS is DOES affect other countries. USA has the largest economy in the world, of course its state affects the rest of the world. Not to mention it has the best militia. Put that in the wrong hands, and they can start invading even more countries for their oil. [end]
[start] Oh and we felt the love from afar yesterday!! All the outpouring of love from different countries for us who managed to get our America back was touching! We (or most of us) are over the moon with excitement and unbridled joy! Thank you for celebrating with us! [end]
[start] Thank you ❤️ [end]
[start] Thanks so much! Biden isnt perfect and I don't expect too much from him, but we have our foot in the door and thats very releiving to me.   Now we wait till January once he is inaugurated! :) again thank you! [end]
[start] Thank you. In 8 years the GOP will elect someone much worse.   It is what they do. [end]
[start] Knowing that decent people all around the globe were horrified by him helped me keep my sanity over the last 4 years. Thank you so much for caring about us. [end]
[start] thank you! it honestly still feels quite unreal. i’m 21 and have lived in ohio my entire life. everyone was on the edges of their seats for four days, and yesterday, when i finally got that text from my mom — “Victory!” — it’s like i was finally able to breathe normally again. i hope that my generation and the ones that come after us are able to maintain this energy we’ve found. i don’t want us to make the same mistakes as our grandparents. [end]
[start] It honestly feels like waking out of a depressive episode. I feel lighter, and hopeful, and happy. Like I can fucking breathe again. And it’s not just me! The nation! The world! We all get to fucking breathe! [end]
[start] I am Black, Queer, a Woman and American. To say that I broke down and sobbed large happy tears is an understatement. The thing is, it's not about Biden or Harris being squeaky clean and perfect human beings, this was about the driving force behind the resurgence of open and unabashed racism behind tamped back down. Without the fuel, I'm hoping that this hate fire will die back down some. [end]
[start] I was reading comments from Sky News Australia videos on YouTube before - it's always entertaining - there appears to be a lot of pro-Trump Aussies. That being said I find American politics overall somewhat entertaining, it's a devolution of what democracy is supposed to be. Hopefully you guys get some innovative people in the future, politics seems to be at a stagnation for many places. [end]
[start] I was at work when it was determined that Biden won. When i got home I have been nothing but tears. I’m so proud of the country I live in for making the choice for change. [end]
[start] From an American that ran away from Trump’s America to study in Bergen last year, I thank you so dearly 💕 Listen to Kamala Harris’ speech, made me cry [end]
[start] Thank you! You have no idea how good it feels. I’m a grown man and I cried during Harris’ and Biden’s victory speeches. [end]
[start] We thank you and apologize for the last four ridiculously awful, agonizing years!  Takk skal du ha [end]
[start] Thank you to the rest of the world for hanging in there with us.  We owe everyone an apology for what he put this planet through.  I don't know what the next 4 years will bring, but at least we will have a descent human being back in the Office of the President.  It saddens me that over 70 million people still voted for President Trump.  It became a matter of integrity and human decency and less about policy.  Shame on the 10's of millions of Americans that did not vote.  That is a bigger travisty than voting for President Trump.  Come January, we can proudly return to the world stage with our heads held high instead of cringing and apologizing. [end]
[start] Lmao [end]
[start] Thank you for saying this. Cheers [end]
[start] Social media is not america. Don't be fooled [end]
[start] Dignity at least. Credibility has to be re-earned. [end]
[start] So happy here!!! The massive relief and hope for the future felt everywhere was so much needed! [end]
[start] Thank you so very much! I hope that we can restore our country from being the laughing stock of the world back to a land of POSSIBILITIES!!! I just watched the speeches made by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and am happy to say...”That’s MY Presidential team”!! [end]
[start] I live in the Middle East and most people were pretty dissapointed he lost, he has actually done a lot of good and its sad so many people let the media manipulate them into thinking he is something he is not. [end]
[start] So a guy who the billionaires, wall street,big tech, Hollywood, mainstream media and career politicians support (Biden) is supposed to bring back dignity? It’s supposed to make us happy? Oh but the world likes him so he must be good huh? Smh [end]
[start] Thank you. It’s such a relief. [end]
[start] You mean MSM won lol. All politicians are crooked. [end]
[start] Thank you! Its nice to know other countries empathize with us. Trump was literally encouraging Nazi behavior.....glad he is out! [end]
[start] Thank you, this means a lot to me. This was the first election I’ve ever cared to vote for (in my late 20s) and it’s nice to see that my vote/voice was heard and counted. I got emotional as well listening to the speeches. It’s nice to see people from other countries care so much and understand. I feel relieved like a weight has been lifted. I feel less anxiety and more calm. Onward and upward from here, we did it. This presidency was turning into a dictatorship but we all made our voices HEARD even throughout the entire world, thank you [end]
[start] Thanks, but it's mostly only a cosmetic change.  We have problems far beyond Trump. [end]
[start] Another Norwegian crying tears of relief, hope, especially at the Madam Vice President's words to children all over America. [end]
[start] Thank you for your kind words, it’s much appreciated. I was watching news coverage of the election with my 81 year old grandmother the other day, and she told me that this is by far the most important election that’s happened in her lifetime, I believe it. If Trump was to have won and been in office another 4 years, I’d have been truly frightened for the future of this country in his hands, in the midst of this pandemic. Biden’s win has instilled much needed hope. [end]
[start] Me as a Palestinian don't really give a fuck about who wins. Both would fuck us over as usual. [end]
[start] Thank you. I really mean this. For many of us, it also feels like America won. [end]
[start] Considering the candidates, I'd say everyone lost. [end]
[start] Thank you! We are here in DC crying tears of joy too! [end]
[start] Thanks, but this is not us climbing back up the hill of betterment.  This is us finally succeeding in stopping our fall into the fiery pit of complete failure.  About 80% of the way down. [end]
[start] Thank you!!!! [end]
[start] Sadly, I personally know a Trump loving, covid denying moron in Norway. They exist here. [end]
[start] Why does any of that have to do with you. [end]
[start] Cringetopia [end]
[start] In before court litigation actually wins America back. [end]
[start] Thanks. It was a nerve wracking election for all of us. Gahhh the numbers. But now we have to worry about having a successful transfer of power which Trump is probably not capable of doing. [end]
[start] Funny that you forget the entirety of HongKong who look up to our government and PRAY that they’ll someday have a system like ours. America is full of people who took advantage of the first president in a long time who put the country first even if it meant getting BASHED by the media and half the population who buy into what’s spread about him. I have no hate for anyone I’m just sick of people spitting in Trump’s face for what he’s done for us. Which somehow people can actually say is “nothing” entirely. Crazy times [end]
[start] Biden hasn't won yet.  Just because the Lame Stream Media proclaims it doesn't make it so.   If Biden/Harris and tge globalist cabal is declared the winner they won't get much accomplished. The Senate is still republican and Republicans won 12 seats in the House. Democrats have a very slim hold on the house. [end]
[start] Thanks, but nothing will fundamentally change in our country because Biden is a corporate stooge. [end]
[start] I am proud to be an American again! Fuck Trump! [end]
[start] it's not their land, and they'll be back to bombing brown people like it's business as usual soon. [end]
[start] Serious question why are foreigners so infatuated with American politics and culture? [end]
[start] Takk!! (The only Norwegian I know) [end]
[start] OP: "congratulation on winning your land" Native Americans: 🤷🤦🙍 [end]
[start] Thank you thank you thank you!!!! We did it, we actually did it!! [end]
[start] Ugh we still need to boot the hateful brainwashed cult trolls. I would say help them but it is beyond that now. ‘They’ just won’t accept anything other than delusion and violence. [end]
[start] What credibility? This is but damage control. Let’s see what the future holds. [end]
[start] I assume from this you’re going to help me pay the increased taxes. But seriously, our media has been taken over by corporate interests. What you’ve been reading and seeing about us likely has little to do with reality. For example how many times has Trump denounced white supremacy?  Never?  It’s actually 19 times... and I think that’s in the last 4 years only. Don’t believe every thing you see on TV or the Internet. [end]
[start] Dude I promise you. It's only happy to people that only pay attention when things are bad. Bad things happened under Obama and everyone gave him a pass. Americans will continue to suffer from crippling medical and school debt. The rich will continue to commit crimes and get away with them. We'll continue to criminalize marijuana. The wars in the Middle east will continue.  [Nothing will fundamentally change](https://youtu.be/agizSs17J-U) [end]
[start] Lots of love and respect from America [end]
[start] I am very grateful people in other countries care about us. Thank you! [end]
[start] This post made my Amazing day even more amazzzzzzing..... Xo [end]
[start] The fact that we had 2 bottom of the barrel choices is sad.  I feel sorry for America bc we deserve better.  Also, how about every one worry about their own stuff. Better people & a better society & better world starts at home. The work gets better because good people raise good people. [end]
[start] As an Indian I find it refreshing and hilarious to see an American President not TWEET LIKE THIS ANYMORE!!!!   Hope Biden is the 1st step in the right direction to destroying the right wing polarization that has engulfed our planet! [end]
[start] >I haven’t yet encountered one person outside of USA to see much good in Trump.    I know there is a not insignificant amount if support for trump in india and africa [end]
[start] Er, this doesn’t change the fact that 60,000,000 people or thereabouts fully support trump, his party and their actions. A change in president (let’s not forget that the senate and the Supreme Court are Republican controlled) doesn’t change any of this. The country is very divided, and I see a new Republican president in 4 years because this tribalism isn’t going anywhere. [end]
[start] The author of the patriot act winning is nothing to celebrate.  edit: Reddit always hates this and downvotes.  >I drafted a terrorism bill after the Oklahoma City bombing,” Biden was quoted as saying by the New Republic in 2001.  >**“And the bill John Ashcroft sent up was my bill,”** Biden continued, referring to the Patriot Act. The act broadened the surveillance capabilities of U.S. law enforcement agencies as it relates to identifying potential terrorists, and many of its provisions have been opposed by liberal Democrats and civil libertarians.  https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/andrewkaczynski/surveillance-joe [end]
[start] [I don't think USA won. They just got the same thing in different box.](https://youtu.be/oihV9yrZRHg?t=406) 6:46 for example. [end]
[start] Could you tell us why ? I’m just so tired of people saying “trump bad” on the internet and immediately receiving likes and stuff, no evidence attached. I don’t really like Trump that much, but to see the man slandered without evidence over and over again, There’s people in government twice as corrupt and disgusting and you hear nothing about them edit : lol thanks for proving my point, you people are ridiculous [end]
[start] Holy shit this is the cringiest, most pathetic shit I've ever read. Why are liberals so fucking weird and ridiculous with everything? Lmao holy fucking hell I can't comprehend this crackheaded shit. [end]
[start] Thing is that we have Republican Senate. [end]
[start] Thank you very much.  &#x200B;  Now we need luck for the next year as Trump tries as hard as he can to get the election reversed. [end]
[start] Yeah we never lost our country under Trump. His only problem was he won an election over a career criminal Clinton. He was spied on by the Obama administration including Biden. And no one goes to jail. He was never allowed to be the president. It was as if he was a cancer. When in fact it is everyone in the ruleing parties in DC that are the cancer.  He managed to get three Arab nations to normalize relations with Isreal. A feat no president in my life time has ever even come close to. Not a single mainstream media outlet even reported on it. So I guess if world peace isn’t your bag wait to see what China does in the next few months. They have Biden dead to rights because they have the goods on how corrupt he is. There will be no stoping China now. You can kiss Hong Kong good bye. You can also do the same for Tiawane. North Korea will finally be allowed to nuke the US. All because China is holding all the cards against crooked sleepy joe. His family is being investigated by the FBI for money Laundering until January 1. Just a final thought about the criminal justice system in the USA. The only people who never go to jail are Politicians, Lawyers, and Judges. Can you guess who wanted to change that?  TRUMP. So rigging an election with unsubstantiated ballots isn’t to far from the truth to keep your ass out of a federal prison. [end]
[start] Thank you for recognizing this.  it’s not simply an issue Of being affected by him as an individual but really it’s about being affected by the hate that he stands for and spreads. With or without Trump It could happen anywhere in the world and we should all recognize what happened  is not just a win for American democracy but also a tip of the scale toward decency for the whole human race.    Proud American speaking, Forgive my intensity :) [end]
[start] Thank you so much.  I haven’t cried like this since the WNBA was on live TV. Never thought I’d see a female VP let alone have a reprieve from Trump. There is a lot of work ahead though. The next Trump won’t be such an obvious POS and we have to stay vigilant. [end]
[start] Thank you so much for keeping our country in your thoughts. Sending good vibes to Norway! [end]
[start] Thank you! I view it the same; we all won. I don’t remember the last time I felt so elated and peaceful. I actually felt pride for my country again after hearing tonight’s speeches [end]
[start] This is very thoughtful. We appreciate you [end]
[start] Thank you so much for this. As an American, I’m so excited to see how this improves & strengthens our relationships with the rest of the world ❤️ [end]
[start] We did not do any of what you say. The political divide is still here, and more rampant than ever. This election is a disaster no matter who would’ve won [end]
[start] America hasn’t won any of that back.   America are almost split exactly down the middle. There are two VERY different America’s living in complete dissonance with each other.  Trump may not be president, but everything he represented was supported (on aggregate) by his supporters. The same ideologies Trump promoted are the ideologies that live in the hearts of these people.   Until Democrats can understand where republicans are coming from and republicans can do the same for democrats, America is a powder keg.  Trump represented a nation, he didn’t define it. As I said, there are two completely ideologically divorced nation’s living on top of one another.  I think it’s appalling and not at all American that Democrat supporters can treat Republicans as though they aren’t Americans and vice versa. [end]
[start] If you are not amrican and do not know I should let you know, the peoples votes dont matter - they are a suggestion to the electiorial college and they are the ones who decide. [end]
[start] biden isnt good,but trump is worse [end]
[start] Thank you!! It has been a brutal uphill battle and if the facist sympathizers hold their seats, we are in for a rough 4 years. Like 2012-16 rough when we need 2008-12 smooth. [end]
[start] As an American I appreciate it but it’s been real hard for me and my family personally we’re big fans of trump and this felt like a huge stab in the heart [end]
[start] I abhor Trump and while celebrating I worry about Harris [end]
[start] One.  The US is as a whole a country.  We have not gained or lost any land as a result of this election. You weak minded snowflakes see trump as a stain but we will see how badly Biden and commiya skrew the country up and hope a republican gets the next one to un skrew Biden’s mistakes and Obama’s mistakes and trumps mistakes.   We need somebody qualified not an old man on deaths door nomatter the party, no young radicalist should either only a sound educated mind can rule the country and we just haven’t seen intelligence in a very long time as president that goes all the way back to Obama’s miserable quota hire career as president and now Biden the puppet will push all of the same failed policies where Americans have to fix again. [end]
[start] I don’t like trump at all but I don’t see how a racist who brags about voter fraud being our president is saving America. Just being honest 😣 [end]
[start] U all are stupid trump has done more for this country then any other president [end]
[start] The interesting part is losing D seats, how did this happen? Either actual fraud, or people stupid enough to vote out Trump, and leaving the rest of the ballot blank lmfao   Since it’s likely not a fraud issue, it was a bunch of OMB and didn’t bother to vote on anything else. [end]
[start]  I stay up to date with US politics even though I live in the UK. After looking at the policies of both candidates I was hoping for Trump to win despite me hating that guy. The Biden-Harris administration is a disaster in every way imaginable. [end]
[start] I am from Czech republic. We had commies here for a long  time and thus we are aware that what is going on in America right now is not good. America was like a pillar of free speech for us being under communist dictatorship, but now we see that there is lot od censorship in America aswell. Leftist ideology plagued United states and thats like the beginning of end. We lived through it and overcame after all, si its sad to see all that bullshit in America - MeToo, BLM, gender propaganda, universities being centres of leftism... [end]
[start] Oh fuck off. Trump deserved to lose, Biden is going to make a shitty president too. He just won't tweet as much stupidity. [end]
[start] You have been misinformed about President Trump. Unfortunately, the world knows about American through the mainstream news, which is dominated by the Democrat Party.  Please, go out of your way to find out more about the President.  For instance, the Democrats labeled him a racist, but it is absolutely NOT TRUE!  Not so surprisingly, he is beloved by at least 50% of the USA!!!!! [end]
[start] Half of Americans don’t agree with you tho [end]
[start] I don't really understand such a post or behavior. America is in a dark place and people's problems will not be solved by Biden or Trump. It's on them, but they are wrapped up in things that don't matter, wasting their time on reddit as an economic apocalypse looms.  Homelessness is out of control in America in cities were Biden's party has firm control. If the compassionate and socially liberal part isn't solving these problem, just wait until there is no choice but austerity. The US is up the creek now. Biden? Useless as Trump. They both want to spend money that doesn't exist. [end]
[start] Joe abiden may not be the best, or the youngest candidate. He may not be fit to be President, maybe he's gonna die off old age, or have Alzheimer's during his 4-8 years. But. He's not Trump i guess? [end]
[start] We didn’t reclaim our dignity. We elected Joe Biden. This is one baby step towards credibility. Check back in 5-7 elections to see if we elect a real human being and not neoliberal trash. [end]
[start] Lmao you watch too much CNN that’s why your brainwashed to not like trump [end]
[start] Trump didn’t lose, he won and there was in fact election fraud. [end]
[start] The whole of the US traditional allies are relieved.   From outside looking in you keep wondering what kind of mongs chose a clown like Trump as their poster boy? [end]
[start] Thank you! We still have a lot of work to do but it’s a fantastic start [end]
[start] Your country is beautiful and I loved visiting it, thanks for the kind support. We're elated though a lot of us are still delusional.   It's a small step in the fight for a safety net, childcare, healthcare, and living wages [end]
[start] Thank u so much..I know my palpitations have subsided a bit already. [end]
[start] I too celebrate Mama Harris on her rise to the white house. Not sure if she will keep jailing predominantly minority offenders over drugs, but she has to appease the establishment somehow. [end]
[start] Thank you!!! [end]
[start] > I’ve been completely unaffected by Trump, yet I cry tears of happiness for America winning the election  truly a reddit moment [end]
[start] Nearly half the american people voted for Donald Trump. It's not a win for both Republicans and Democrats. I honestly would've been equally apathetic to either candidate being elected. It'd be better if nobody cared about the election and neighbors could love each other, or at least not hate each other for such contrived conflicts as the election. [end]
[start] Well Biden supported Serbian bombing in the 90s. I'm from there and I kinda don't want bombs you know. If Biden doesn't bomb us then we cool. [end]
[start] Yay, we let a senile treasonous racist steal our election.  Yeah, we’re doing great. [end]
[start] imagine being this retarded [end]
[start] American here. Today really felt euphoric. A weight has been lifted off of so many of our shoulders. I feel like the clouds have parted. For the first time in four years, I want to go out and buy a flag to wave. My husband and I started singing God Bless the USA Today. And we’re atheists, lol. Was just a freakin glorious day :) [end]
[start] If I have to read another one of these lib ass posts I'm gonna fly into the sun >In my eyes, both republicans and democrats won the election this time.  Political instincts of an amoeba [end]
[start] Biden will be impeached. [end]
[start] Same here, Trump or not it will not affect me in slightest in my country, but I don't know.. it was entertaining to watch Trump, he was a prime asshole and actually looked like a average American. Well, maybe biden and kamala will have their own fuck ups to entertain the world haha, one can only hope. [end]
[start] All of you foreigners need to shut up about our election. You obviously aren't familiar with Biden's background. Obama/Biden being conservative corporatists with the "change" disguise was the leading cause of Trump's election. That's not even mentioning Biden's personal failures and corruption throughout his ridiculous career.  Nothing will fundamentally change, as Biden said. So much needs to happen in the US and it's laughable that anybody thinks Biden is an acceptable answer.  Edit: Yes, keep downvoting me for valid criticism of the shitty Democratic candidate that was forced upon us. I thought this was America, but criticism isn't allowed when the establishment is in control. [end]
[start] STFU sheep. We just elected a dementia ridden empty suit. Trump 2024!! [end]
[start] Something good Trump did?  &#x200B;  Ok. He's investing in Africa, and for the first time in decades there was an option other than China, who is CURRENTLY doing such things as exploitative mining, debt trap diplomacy and training our politicians in communist universities in China.  &#x200B;  "Democratic America" didn't give a fuck, and we're about to lose all the support we've gained and switch back to worshiping communists.  &#x200B;  I don't like Trump.   But trust me, I fucking hate having my country be sold off and sold out to China.  &#x200B;  "Orange man bad"; I realize that every special snowflake can't handle him, but just like the guy who drives the garbage truck, he's necessary. [end]
[start] Orang man still bad   I guess [end]
[start] As much as I appreciate the sentiment I’m baffled at how many people believe America is saved because Biden is president. He’s as crooked as they come. I’m in no means a Trump supporter but if Biden is our only hope...yikes. [end]
[start] Du er faktisk tilbakestående. Nordmenn kommer til å dø i en krig i midtøsten, sammen med hundretusenvis av uskyldige og du gråter gledestårer over det.   Heng deg. [end]
[TITLE] I’ve been with my partner for 8 years. Yesterday, someone caught him staring at me. [TITLE]
[start] That's incredibly sweet. People usually post about relationship problems, so it's nice to know there's real love out there. [end]
[start] This reminds me of a photo my mother-in-law snapped of my SO and i unbeknownst to us at thanksgiving last year.   I think i was looking back to talk to someone and SO is looking up at me while we’re cuddling on the couch with such love in his eyes. Warms my heart every time i see it. [end]
[start] These kinds of little moments are everything. All relationships have ups and downs and it’s stuff like this that remind you what is really important when things get a bit harder. And it’s beautiful for other people around you to see it so clearly. Lovely [end]
[start] It happens. I've been with my wife for 13 years and I still catch myself just staring at her sometimes, like, "Wow, I am *lucky*." [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing this. Happy to see genuine love out there like yours. Best of luck to you in the future! Reading this reminded of these things:        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCOisqFtszg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCOisqFtszg)   "All this gladness in life, all  honest pride in doing my work in the world, all this keen sense of  being, I owe to you. And it doubles the gladness, it makes the pride glow, it sharpens the sense of existence till I hardly know if it is pain or pleasure, to think that I owe it to one. To  one whom I love, as  I do not believe man ever loved woman before. It has made me better  loving you. It has made me wiser, and easier, and brighter. I used to  want a great many things before, and to be angry that I did not have them. Theoretically, I was satisfied. I flattered  myself that I had  limited my wants. But I was subject to irritation; I used to have morbid sterile hateful fits of hunger, of desire. Now I really am satisfied, because I can’t think of anything better.” – Henry  James [end]
[start] I know what you mean. That's such a special feeling. After all the routine and being used to each other, it's really sweet when stuff like that happens.   I remember feeling exactly the same thing once with my ex. We bumped into each other. It was so weird and sweet. Like, we weren't meeting or anything. We were just doing our own thing I think I was running some errands and she was doing groceries, and we knew we were doing these things but it was a coincidence that we were doing it near each other. And we just bumped into each other and started laughing our asses off. We didn't even understand why or what was funny about it.   In hindsight, when you're in a relationship, you never get to "bump into your loved one" by accident. You always have more or less an idea of where they are or what they're doing and you're never doing the same thing I guess? Idk. It's a beautiful memory that I have and your situation reminded me of it so thank you! [end]
[start] I love reading this kinda stuff. Makes me happy that there’s still genuine love still in the world [end]
[start] This is so beautiful I swear. [end]
[start] I always think of a line from an episode of Night Court: "Sounds like you had what the rest of us are looking for." [end]
[start] If you don’t mind answering, how is your personality vs his? How do you compliment each other? [end]
[start] The more I am in a relationship, the more attractive the person become to me. The problem is, the girlfriends I had in the past, did not have the same thing. They became "tired" and stop giving a shit in the end. [end]
[start] Lol, this reminds me of the time in college when I was at my boyfriend’s frat party, and apparently one of his brothers came up to him and was like “hey dude that girl is looking at you like she wants you” and he was like “who?” and the guy pointed at me, haha. Been together almost six years now! [end]
[start] See, now I'm just sitting here grinning stupidly at my phone. You guys are beautiful. [end]
[start] Okay...I’m just going to go and cry in my corner now... [end]
[start] Awww 🥺😭 so sweet!! Hold on to that. Going on 17 years here and I don’t think I’ve ever had that 💔 [end]
[start] Woah, that's lovely. Well, congrats! :) [end]
[start] I love this 🥺 [end]
[start] This is so sweet. It’s natural for relationships to lose some of that excitement over time but it’s great that the admiration, love, and respect are still there. You’re both very lucky! [end]
[start] I hope this is how my relationship is 8 years from now. [end]
[start] People in world longed to feel what you guys have. Hope you guys stay happy forever!! [end]
[start] This is so sweet! Made me smile [end]
[start] He was likely admiring your beauty and other attributes, or he was trapped in his own thoughts, which of course, were about you. What his thoughts were could've been a many things of course. But if you're curious as to why he looked at you in such a way I believe you should've or should ask him? Asking him could open up a conversation and in return his words could induce feelings of intimacy that could cause a spike or burst of passion that you stated has fizzled; likely due to the consistency of course. Sometimes we don't ask because we are afraid, but being afraid will hinder your growth. [end]
[start] Yea, I used to stare at my ex-wife like that......thinking about ways to kill her.  I jest, I jest, congratulations. [end]
[start] This is so wholesome omg :3. [end]
[start] That's amazing, thank you for sharing that. I wish you the best! [end]
[start] THIS IS HELLA CUTE [end]
[start] Awwwww! That’s so sweet. Goals. 🥰 [end]
[start] This absolutely melted my heart [end]
[start] ...  <3 [end]
[start] That’s really sweet! [end]
[start] Thank you for this post. I hope I find this one day. [end]
[start] This is the best thing I read all day ❤️ [end]
[start] I needed to read this. Thanks for posting such a lovely story. It felt so nice reading it. [end]
[start] Sounds like a movie 💕 beautiful ! [end]
[start] That’s adorable [end]
[start] I love this so much ❤ [end]
[start] Cute cute cute [end]
[start] That’s beautiful. I’m so happy you have that. My best friend said the same thing about my husband when he was my boyfriend and she was meeting him for the first time. After having gotten out of a bad 3 year relationship, it was eye opening to know someone wanted to look at me like that. [end]
[start] r/mirin [end]
[start] That's oh so lovely!! What a nice little story tfs [end]
[start] Awe... [end]
[start] r/GirlsMirin [end]
[start] Awwww 💛. [end]
[start] This is so genuinely heartwarming and sweet thank you for sharing. The way someone looks at someone else can describe things words can’t sometimes. Occasionally I can tell my partner is looking at me as we’re doing something, sometimes I purposely just wait to notice but when I do and say what? Like I don’t know I’m always met with the sweetest smile and “I just love looking at you” feels like we’re in our own happy world even if only for a moment. [end]
[start] Awww thats sweet af. Goals 😭 [end]
[start] Lucky you...............!!!!! [end]
[start] I envy you both for what you have together. This is great. [end]
[start] My wife and I have been together for 31 years. We have love in our eyes. People notice how in love we are and I was told people like to hang with us because of our energy together. [end]
[start] How wonderful. My husband and I have been together 45 years, married 41 this coming Dec. 24. Love is a wonderful thing. Thanks for sharing this moment. [end]
[start] AWWWWWW🥺🥺🥺 [end]
[start] Hooray! Love is great!   13 years in my wife and I discovered god together and now we are each others Adam and Eve. Just enjoying this garden of eden.   Much love and don’t ever let go of eachother. [end]
[start] I'm 4 days late to this party but I simply HAVE to chime in. A massive congrats from this Canadian Redditor on your amazing partnership.   My wife and I have been married 20 years.  I still get an electrical 'charge' when she sits beside me.  My stomach does little flips when we are kissing.  I love her so much it scares me.  We have two awesome teenagers and a great family life.  Finally, our sex life is still absolutely fantastic.  It was lovely to read your post and share our story. Congrats again on an amazing partnership. I'm so very happy for you. [end]
[start] LOVE [end]
[start] How cute omg [end]
[start] This is exactly how I want my future partner to look at me like. [end]
[start] this is beautiful <3 [end]
[start] Was he listening though? [end]
[start] Fuck! I stare at my wife while I don’t listen to her, and I get chewed out for it! [end]
[start] My heart!!!! [end]
[start] Ahhh that's so wholesome. [end]
[start] He was looking at you thinking about the BJ you'll be giving him later. [end]
[start] This is so cute and wholesome 🥺 [end]
[start] I voted for trump so fuck you [end]
[start] Welcome to my life. It’s nice here. I don’t know what I did to find love like this at the early age of 17... 14 years later it’s done nothing but increase which I did not think was possible. I feel sorry for people who go their whole lives without this feeling. [end]
[start] Get knee pads hes worth it [end]
[start] this is how i feel about the girl i started dating back in college. my heart feels like it stops every time i see her. she married some other guy about 5 years ago. got two kids. she still txts me every few years to tell me how much she misses me. i don't think its a bad marriage, its just not as good as what we had. [end]
[start] Thanks for reminding me that I’ll never find love [end]
[start] Lmao imagine being good looking 😌 [end]
[start] The whole excitement thing is funny. If ya can’t entertain a woman constantly, things get “boring”. No, you’ve just been with the same person for 8 fuckin years. Aside from the logic, this is a wholesome post. [end]
[start] #THERE IS A SPIDER ON YOUR SHOULDER   he is hoping for a web [end]
[start] Remember this one guys .  Girls like.... Wait for it.... Attention.   What a shocker.  And while they all will deny it. We have all heard a thousand times the exact opposite of this...  "my SO doesn't look at me the same, then I met this guy and the way he looked at me was just...."  It's really that simple. Girls want attention. [end]
[start] "damn she getting a little chonky" [end]
[start] New way to make my side feel I am in love with her 🙏😭 [end]
[start] Hell stop doing that in a few years you’ll see [end]
[TITLE] For fuck's sake Google, I do NOT want to use my real name on Youtube, you do NOT have to ask me again later, since I will answer NO, just like the last fifty times. [TITLE]
[start] Remember when Youtube specifically told you not to give your personal information to *anyone*? [end]
[start] > ||s.ytimg.com/yts/jsbin/www-linkgplusdialog*  Throw that in your filters on AdBlock. Haven't seen it since. [end]
[start] And while we're at it: fuck you Facebook, I want to sort by 'most recent' *every fucking time* please. [end]
[start] Facebook wants my phone number, YouTube your real name and Xbox wants 2 emails and a credit card.  But whenever I say these things are unnecessary for these services (especially because they all used to exist and function without all this information) people just call me an old man.  [end]
[start] Maybe we can just keep submitting bug reports:  "Youtube won't remember my preference about SAYING NO when it asks me to change to my name" [end]
[start] Also YouTube can you start buffering the fucking video? [end]
[start] What is going on with google.. they were supposed to be a benevolent company but they are doing really creepy invasive things.. [end]
[start] Remember when total privacy was one of the best features of the internet? You could discuss if Captian Kirk or Captian Picard was better without everyone knowing you down to your fucking DNA.  [end]
[start] It asks me over and over. Also the top charts for most viewed by day, week, month is missing or moved where I can't find it.   It's like Google wants me to use less YouTube  [end]
[start] As someone who uses pseudonyms but tries to be kind and polite on the Internet (OK; maybe I sometimes post lay speculation in science threads or go off a bit on tangents, but my intentions are good): I'm sick to death of a related phenomenon, which is the push to get people to use their real names all the time on the Web.   College kids, people with government jobs, retirees and people who only post about gardening can use their real names.   People who have real jobs and volunteer jobs with respectable soccer moms at the charter school and want to burble on about UFOs, or what exactly makes the Adventures of Merlin seem way more amazing than it deserved to be, or to create weird attempts at animation humor, need to use pseudonyms. Not because we're starting flamewars, but because our fan interests and our efforts to construct conventional lives don't mix.  EDIT: typo fix.  [end]
[start] Youtube is one of the first sites to drive me away with redesigns and bullshit like this. I put up with the ads, but it got to the point where it was no longer easy to use. I used to subscribe and watch a bunch of channels but it wasn't worth it anymore  [end]
[start] How about the fact that videos don't buffer when you pause them? I have the fastest internet speed available and can't watch a 1080p video. Things are going backwards for youtube.   Vimeo HD video quality is way better and it NEVER buffers.  [end]
[start] "We'll try again later /smugface" - Google [end]
[start] They know that. They're hoping you eventually give in or misclick. [end]
[start] Give it the 'F5 fuckoff' every time I see that shit.  [end]
[start] Youtube: Only popular because of inertia at this point... [end]
[start] FUCK YOUTUBE IN GENERAL!  You've got to click like three fucking times now to turn of annotations, or increase the video size! Also, the loading bar does not mean SHIT any more!! You have a full video loaded and want to rewatch/rewind? Well, fuck you, we'll make you reload the whole thing.    I also used the site without adblock for the first time in months the other day.. holy shit. there is a fucking 15-30 ad before nearly every single video. Heinous.  [end]
[start] Lucky you, you can turn them down. I closed my Google accounts and created a new one, and now I have no choice. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Google is supposed to be amazing web designers or some shit, but I swear, since they've bought Youtube they have done absolutely nothing that I like and a lot of things I don't. [end]
[start] Neither Youtube nor Google have ever offered me their number.  Youtube and Google are rude.   [end]
[start] God this is infuriating. Someone needs to make a browser script that automatically clicks no. [end]
[start] The bigger this behemoth grows, the more Google has forced me to pull back support. [end]
[start] It's nice to have a monopoly. [end]
[start] Seriously. Fuck that shit. [end]
[start] Google can kindly suck my knob.  [end]
[start] Seriously google. Stop trying to make this shit happen. My anonymity protects me from all the shady fuckers out there. You and the government trying to turn the internet into some family friendly bullshit version of internet tv isn't going to fly. Just fucking stop it. [end]
[start] The last update for merging your google+ and youtube accounts actually broke my youtube account. I can see it and view its videos, but can't log in to it. [end]
[start] Mine name somehow switched over automatically.  I absolutely never said it could switch.  I always declined, and yet somehow my actual name is there. [end]
[start] One day Google will die just like almost every other successful business.  When it will happen is up to them. [end]
[start] Delete your google plus account and it will stop.   Fuck google, they are evil now, went to the dark side. Sergei, Eric. And Larry are too busy building their own airport to give a fuck.  http://mashable.com/2013/02/09/google-private-jets-airport/  Just rip the bandaid off and stop using their products. I just did and set up own hosting and mail that is deleted off of the cloud every week.   Any mail on gmail(or any cloud) can be read by any law enforcement without a warrant after 6 months.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_Communications_Act  Yeah so fuck 'em, now we just need a viable competitor that let's their users/content providers participate in profits. That's the one cool thing about YouTube. Until they disable your YouTube account and keep all your ad earnings without any explanation.  Yeah Fuck Google, evil dicks... [end]
[start] And NO, I don't want to use fucking Chrome or that other shit you are advertising on the home page. I've closed the ad once, LEAVE IT CLOSED, you fucking dickheads. The more you advertise, the less I will take notice and the more I'll refuse on principle.   Also, STOP tying my email accounts to other sites and stop fucking asking me to give personal details and phone numbers. If I wanted to give you more info, I'd write you a fucking letter. Stop it. [end]
[start] seriously google get your fucking head in the game, also change that shitty youtube not always doing hd bullshit  [end]
[start] I caved and now I have my old channel and a channel with my G+ name. It reads them as two separate accounts so I have to switch to my main every time I want to see my subs. Bluh. [end]
[start] OK, we'll ask again later. [end]
[start] Could be worse. reddit could be prompting you to change to your real name every other day... a single errant click revealing all the scuzzy secrets you've shared about yourself on here with your friends, family and prospective employers. [end]
[start] Xbox wants two e-mails, live/hotmail want two e-mails and a phone number. Fuck you. The only reason I have a windows e-mail account is so I can use it as a spam mule. I don't give a shit if some leet haxX0r gets into my e-mail and finds my old Maplestory password and offers from a watch company. [end]
[start] Anyone work in Google, or know somebody that does? Get the fuckers responsible for this shit to read this thread will you? [end]
[start] I gave in, and then after I commented on something someone was like "Oh yeah well listen here SmokeyUnicycle, you're mad gay" and I felt sad :( [end]
[start] The shitty thing is that if Google hadn't bowed down and let the NSA fuck all of us, I wouldn't have a problem, but Google has proven that IT CAN NOT BE TRUSTED WITH OUR DATA, so no, I am not going to let it juxtapose my browsing, social, and viewing habits. [end]
[start] They are not asking [end]
[start] Yeah and their regard to our privacy is just getting worse.  Just today they updated their policy to allow themselves to use you and your friends (Google+)  in personalized advertisements. [end]
[start] It felt like virtual bullying, i had to  create fake gmail id and give in to that bullying. i felt very sad that day. [end]
[start] And now they just removed the 480p resolution in all their videos. I have to choose the shitty 360p and watch pixelated videos or wait for the 720p to buffer since I don't have a good connection in the city I study. [end]
[start] And stop trying to make Google+ a thing, it's not going to happen [end]
[start] I hope you all realize that the easiest way to stop this from happening is to just click a reason other than "I don't want to". One of the options is "My username is a personality/more well known" or something. I just clicked that and I haven't been bothered by Youtube since. [end]
[start] And i do NOT want to create a google plus account. All I asked for was to create a youtube account, and nothing else. [end]
[start] I agree, so f***** annoying, good to know that I'm not they only one that is pissed off by this bullshit. [end]
[start] Any day now they will just flip a switch and we will all be forced to use our real names. [end]
[start] [YouTube has hit it's peak](http://imgur.com/GRZHVPW) and now some product manger is trying to monitise the shit out of it.  I had a whine about the in video ads afew days back and got downvoted for it by people saying you have to expect ads on a free service. IMO you could add a pay to avoid ads and you dont have to be that intrusive for the freemium model. It's a bit of a shame as YouTube could be another Netflix but they seem to be reverting back to the TV model. Personally I use it less and less and it will be interesting to see how it goes over the next 5/10 years. My feeling it this is ripe for another disruption over the medium term.  [end]
[start] If you say no to it often enough, eventually it caves in and lets you use your youtube username on G+. After that it stops asking. [end]
[start] I just used a fake name. So...do that and calm down. [end]
[start] My thought on it is. If they are so worried about holding people accountable for their comments why not just ban accounts like Reddit does. As is i can make a google account with the name filled in as Cock Knobinton with an email of john.smith@yada. Yes i would like to use my real name youtube thanks.  [end]
[start] Could someone make an addon to shut it up? [end]
[start] I finally broke down and run two browsers to separate my google stuff from non-google stuff, this is actually a big reason I finally did it. I'll post youtube stuff from chrome, but whenever I just visit I use firefox.  I am quite pro-google (android, google drive, youtube, gmail,...), but for fucks sake stop trying to force me to link something I don't want to. I already have linked my phone, does google want my blood next? [end]
[start] They stopped asking me many months ago, why are they still bugging everyone else? [end]
[start] /r/self ?  TIL. [end]
[start] What really pisses me off is that, after I said no multiple times, one day I checked and they went ahead and did it anyway.  So I specifically had to go into my settings and un-link my G+ and YouTube accounts. [end]
[start] It is really unfortunate they won't change this.  Nothing like having another data point they can link to your name.  I am getting pretty tired of youtube/google at this point. [end]
[start] also I want to see related videos on the right of a video i am watching I don't care what you recommend. sometimes I can't even find the next episode of something because the list is 3/4 recommended videos. [end]
[start] I say this in every thread about this topic.   Step one.  Make a fake account with a semi real name.   Step two.  Get a fun picture.  Step three.  Start your new google life as Mr/Mrs Alias and never get harassed about your real name again.  [end]
[start] Why stay logged in? I only log in for gmail, and I always log out after. No questions. [end]
[start] Seriously, who else remembers in the late 90s and early 00s when the number one tip people gave for using the internet was NEVER to reveal your real name, location or any other personal information online?  [end]
[start] The android app is pissing me off, I get it youtube, slide to close you don't have to remind me on every video I watch....  [end]
[start] is that how Google dies? asking too many questions.  [end]
[start] I really miss the old YouTube. Google has completely destroyed it. I can't even check my inbox anymore. The button is completely gone. Also, it's impossible to use the service easily anymore with all of these interface changes. Do they not see that everyone hates what they're doing? Why keep making more of what everyone says they don't like when your service is supposed to be about the users?  [end]
[start] Google is clearly determined to have anyone who even touches a Google product sign up to Google+. The more Google+ has failed, the more forceful Google has become. They're basically abusing their position of power to get their way. [end]
[start] There is an option to make a google page with your old youtube username, I've done this and never been asked again: [my page](http://youtube.com/user/wongsmokesbong) [end]
[start] I accidentally clicked 'yes' on that thing and now I have [this](http://i.imgur.com/i0KJnwz.png?1) every time I log on.  I have never, not once, selected to use my google account.  I'm slowly moving my youtube subscriptions to RSS feeds in Feedly and then I will never need to visit youtube proper. [end]
[start] And that is why i left for Microsoft's ecosystem, Youtube is the only service left.  Compared to this shit they are saints of privacy. Google became more vile then Facebook. Worse is that tech media can't stop sucking their cyber-cock, they literally can do no wrong in their eyes.  I'm still waiting for the day theUS/ EU steps in and breaks their anti-trust hammer on Google like they did with MS in the '90.  I knew they were bad news then TOS started changing every 6 months in their favor and the fact that **USERS are currency to them**.  All this freemium shit is cancer to the software ecosystem. I want to pay and own a software not the other way around. [end]
[start] They actually created a second YouTube channel for my Google Plus page after I repeated refused this. I have to switch between the channels when I log in, and it's difficult to switch if I've chosen the wrong one. Makes me worried my 2006 account is going to vanish one day, along with all my my old videos.  [end]
[TITLE] I work in Law Enforcement. Here's what I'm seeing from the inside. [TITLE]
[start] I'd love you to do an AMA in the proper sub and submit proof etc. I think people would love to ask you some questions because there's so much fear and uncertainty out there. [end]
[start] Please gather evidence as safely as you can before you leave. They need to be exposed so its harder for them to go back to the status quo.  Be safe OP. [end]
[start] My husband's in the same boat. He's looking into a medical retirement. [end]
[start] Gather evidence [end]
[start] I was arrested in New York Monday night for peacefully protesting. You are right, the police are going after the peaceful protesters because they are less likely to get violent. I was cuffed for seven hours and then in the holding cell for twelve. We were cornered and then arrested, nobody was looting, burning, or being violent. Got charged with obstructing government movement or some shit, which makes absolutely no sense. I was never read my rights and they never told me what I was actually charged with until I looked it up. There was a black man in the cell whose leg was badly bleeding and they wouldn’t call an ambulance for three hours. They didn’t want to give us water. I tried talking to some of them and they just wouldn’t engage in meaningful conversation. They beat the shit out of a black guy and then started joking with him afterwards. Good for you for quitting. I told one cop that he seemed like a decent guy but he needed to stand up to the bad cops and he said that’s not how it worked. They don’t care. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] expose em  edit: this is actually asking a lot. youd be directly putting yourself in harms way. stay safe op, respect [end]
[start] Former LEO here - I am SO glad I retired early. [end]
[start] I understand why you would want to quit, I do. But take a step back, take a deep breath and consider this again: we are not yet through the covid crisis and the economy is gonna get worse before it gets better. It might not be as easy for you to find other employment right now as you would hope. Hang in there, stay safe and just keep your head down. You are one of the good ones! [end]
[start] So, I'm not surprised by this. But, are there any cops who are questioning what's happening? [end]
[start] This jives with my experience as well, frankly. I am related to or related by marriage to 4 police officers. All are white males between the ages of 28-38.   Two are on a big cities police force. One is:  -a die hard Trumpian/anti-BLM/anti-Muslim/anti-immigration/MAGA/Blame Soros/conspiracy theorist/Russian hashtag spewing/Fox news talking point/I’m sure he’s taking every moment to rejoice in this/seeing ANTIFA behind every camera gun-toting jackass.  This guy volunteers for all the hardcore shit. Kick the Super Terror Cell XTreme Squad?  Sign me up!  -the other is a Trump fan, yes. He doesn’t go around posting crazy nut-bag shit on FB, because he’s not stupid. He’s more level-headed.  He’ll actually have a conversation and not just spew hatred and parrot idiocy at you.  I think he’s a cop’s cop. Just one of the boys.   -third guy worked in the big city for a while but hated being the little fish in the big pond with shitty hours and horrible locations. He moved to a smaller town and a smaller force. Still a trump fan but more like #2 & highly HIGHLY unlikely to see a protest with more than 25 people so moot point.   -Fourth guy is the youngest and is a state trooper in a neighboring state.  Not a Trump guy. Very by the book. I can’t say I’ve spent much time around him since he’s become a trooper, since he’s a couple hours away.  Unless something has drastically changed and he’s completely than he was a couple of years ago, he’s a person with high integrity, a good moral compass, and (fwiw) an interracial marriage.  This is just my take.  I’m a criminal justice student and have taken classes with professors that are lawyers, prison wardens, and cops. They love to tell stories about their experiences. I’m not surprised with what I’m hearing based on what they’ve said. [end]
[start] In 2016 there was a wild police chase in my state, and when the police finally caught the guy, he peacefully got out of his vehicle and laid down on the ground. Then about 5 cops beat the shit out of him. All of it was caught on live TV from a news helicopter.  The next day while chatting with one of my clients who works in law enforcement I expressed my surprise to how the officers acted. He just laughed and said "We do that shit all the time, it's just not usually caught on camera."  I don't know if people go into the job because they're hungry for violence, or if doing the job turns them into what we are now seeing, but either way, it needs to change, and it needs to change now. [end]
[start] this is exactly what you get when you recruit your police from the military, two organizations that should have opposite goals. [end]
[start] I'd say Minneapolis has 4 openings for sure. But there's talk of disbanding the MPD by city council. [end]
[start] Thank you for this, this is so important to hear from someone on the inside.  And much respect for quiting, that is honorable and nothing but supportive for the American people.  Solidarity ✊ [end]
[start] Cross post this in /r/protectandserve please! [end]
[start] You should talk to your best local newspaper of even a national outlet about this anonymously off the record and give them the insight into how to break this open. This is the kind of bullshit we have investigative journalism for. Thank you for recognizing that the cops work for the people. You are being a part of the solution by speaking up here. [end]
[start] Don't quit!!! we need the good ones on the inside. Thanks for letting us know how it is, though. Sending love. [end]
[start] Thanks for posting this interesting perspective. Can't help but feel sick knowing that there are people in this world that rejoice in the suffering of others as much as some of the people you describe have. [end]
[start] Record them next time, then quit. Give that recording to the press, then run for your life. [end]
[start] please go to the press about this. [end]
[start] Before you leave, Leak some of their racist shit. Let your city see the racist things their police force say about them. [end]
[start] Don’t quit! We need actual good police officers!! [end]
[start] This type of exposure is exactly what is needed to facilitate a change. Thank you for your sacrifice of your job. Police standing up against police is going to be  critical for this country moving forward. You're doing the right thing. [end]
[start] >It is almost like they are living out their paramilitary fantasy on US citizens  That's exactly what this is. They are LARPing as billy badasses. It's easy acting tough when the other guy is unarmed. [end]
[start] > I am going to quit.   All I needed to read. [end]
[start] Thank you for your compassion and thank you for quitting. Ever since this shit started, i cannot even begin to understand how "the good eggs" are just silently sitting there, while the bad eggs lead the way. [end]
[start] Thanks for this post.  I've shared on my personal Facebook cuz I work in the same industry, only in Insurance.  The industry I work in is also evil and I'm looking to find another job soon.  Good luck on the job hunt. [end]

[start] You are one of the good cops. Respect. [end]
[start] You say you may leave for private sector. From what you see do you think the actions would be different if this security came from a private organization? As either private or public, where do you think tech could improve and help solve the problems you see? [end]

[start] Gather evidence and try to help expose exactly what the people of America are trying to fight against. When good people do nothing; bad people thrive. [end]
[start] They're LARPers unfit for real military. [end]
[start] This whole police brutality in the US reminds me of that asshole character in the Kite Runner who sodomised the protagonist's best friend as a kid, and he grew up to become a mullah, and he is wanting to sex up the same man's son twenty-five years later.  Just because of this stupid Pashtun power trip over Uzbeks. [end]
[start] How about you resign and join the protesters [end]
[start] Pro tip: If you wanna stop being hated by the general public, find a different career path [end]
[start] I am so happy you are going to quit. You are doing the right thing. You can  be a fire fighter [end]
[start] Seems fake. Link as proof bad link. Phone would be susceptible to id. [end]
[start] Please don’t quit.  We need the good people to stay.  Blow the whistle and call them out (while keeping yourself safe from retaliation). [end]
[start] I hope you don't quit. It is people like you that we need in police force. I HATE the police, but we have to have them. We just have to have people that are not psychologically unfit. Please stay for us. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Honestly, if you and your fellow officers are not making recordings, gathering evidence, and pushing for the prosecution and arrest of fellow officers you are one of the bad guys. You can be brave and serve and protect the public from the internal rot of your department, or if you are sure you can make no difference you can resign in protest. If you stay you may be swinging the nightstick or pulling the trigger. [end]
[start] More people need to see this.  Thank you for posting. [end]
[start] Stay safe! Take care of yourself. [end]
[start] Thank you for telling your story and what you are seeing within your department. Thank you for protecting and serving your community and I'm sorry that things have gotten that bad from the inside to the point you quit. There needs to be more officers like you. [end]
[start] You're the role model we all needed! [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing this. Idk if I can give you any hope, but my small city was successful in peaceful protest over the past few days. Almost no police presence and the police commissioner and mayor were involved in the rally last night. The only officer I saw was later in a photo kneeling but I didn’t see any while I attended. I’m in Pennsylvania. No arrests, no looting, no tear gas, no rubber bullets, no interference at all. I know the police department here has had plenty of issues and we had full on race riots in the past, but they are standing with citizens now. Things are crazy in many cities across the US but some of us (including the police) are doing a good job so far! We need good officers. Maybe you could continue being a good officer somewhere that values you and doesn’t drive you to feel this way. [end]
[start] Damn this needs to get more traction so more people can see this [end]
[start] Before you quite - speak out against your officers who are "\[peltin\]  innocent protestors with rubber bullets and \[firing\] tear gas into the groups." while "not once did the protestors get violent or out of control; they were just standing in the street and officers decided it was time for them to leave." If you are fired you've got a whistleblower suit and unemployment coming your way.     Not speaking out is supporting their terrible behavior and confirming the notion that there are no good cops. Be a good cop - Hold your coworkers accountable. [end]
[start] I respect you. No one deserves such a toxic work environment. Stay safe and healthy, thank you for your service. [end]
[start] Thank you for speaking out. I do not stand with them in any shape of form. [end]
[start] Have some courage and take them down from the inside! If what you say is true, you have the chance to expose the inner workings of an unjust department. [end]
[start] You need to not quit.  The problem with the urge for good officers to quit is that it simply leaves departments with an even higher concentration of bad cops.  Be vocal, be brave, and communication openly with city leaders.  Lead the change. [end]
[start] Thank you for doing this! You’re the type of hero we need right now. Hopefully this inspires others to finally speak up against these ‘people’ (sociopaths in my opinion) in law enforcement. This is real life, not a call of duty game! Everybody should do what they CAN do. Speak up! Hold everybody around you accountable for their actions. That’s the only way to finally start making this a better world for all of us. [end]
[start] Good sir, if you have not left your position yet, I hope that you stay. I feel that you have a greater chance of affecting change from within. We need more people like you helping protect the citizens. I have to believe you have a better chance of promoting the mindset from within that if you were to leave. To echo your closing sentiment, you stay strong. Keep us safe. [end]
[start] >~~It is almost like~~ they are living out their paramilitary fantasy on US citizens. [end]
[start] If you are really looking to move out of state, and it sounds like you have a fairly technical background, there are tons of tech jobs in the pacific northwest (Seattle and Portland), and many of these companies are always hiring. [end]
[start] Thank you for speaking up.  Thank you for not just standing idly by. [end]
[start] Very honest. You’re doing the right thing 100%. A very brave move. [end]
[start] Wish you luck my dude [end]
[start] do remember...there is no profession so infiltrated by white supremacists as the police of America.  http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/402521/doc-26-white-supremacist-infiltration.pdf [end]
[start] If you haven’t quit yet, have you considered using a hidden camera and recording police talking like that? Your city deserves to have solid proof of how your cops are talking about them. [end]
[start] The best thing you can do for the future of our nation is to stay in your role and sabotage from the inside. [end]
[start] Contact the press. Try to get any fellow officers (even non-patrol / non-field offers) to back you up and submit their stories. [end]
[start] Please report what you are seeing to a news outlet, not just here on Reddit.  These protests are happening because people stand by while what you are describing is happening.  Stay safe out there. [end]
[start] Please document whatever you can and share your story with people more important and influential than Reddit. We need more cops willing to break ranks and stand up for what's right. [end]
[start] So take some shit with you. [end]
[start] Did you report any of them for the stories about assaulting people? Take notes on who the officers were so if and when people are held accountable that you can turn it over to the appropriate people? [end]
[start] What kind of respectable technical person uses an 07 G2? Do you try to obfuscate your work with overlapping lines, smeared and muddled text? Get out of here....05 at the most if not the 38!  Be safe, hopefully you can find a department/job that respects you and your work and that you feel comfortable supporting. [end]
[start] Tape that shit [end]
[start] Thank you so much for posting. This means so much. I wish you the very best of luck on finding a new job. If you are stuck in the south, Austin is a great place to live and has lots of tech jobs, so its worth having a look here. The community is so amazing. [end]
[start] This makes me so proud of the police in my area NOT turning our peaceful protest on monday into a shitshow. They did a good job hanging back and letting people protest without making things worse or using force. [end]
[start] People need proof?? How about if you don’t believe it you just move on with your day? [end]
[start] it's more effective if you work from the inside, and subvert their goals by malicious incompetence.  apply fixes that look like they solve problems, but introduce other, more nefarious bugs. set cup limits so applications slow down. create hidden backups of incriminating data. leak data to the press.   you are for more effective if you stay in your position.  they're is a CIA manual for civilian sabotage they published in WW2 for German citizens who wanted to resist, but couldn't resist overtly . find a copy and read it. [end]
[start] We should send them to a real warzone where there is return fire and they see their buddies die right next to them. [end]

[start] A person I know has a disability that makes it hard for him to recognize intent and emotions of others yet he's still an active duty officer. That type of disability can result in various misconduct. US, come on. [end]

[start] Look at the bright side. Both the police and the protesters will be largely sick with covid-19 in a few weeks. [end]
[start] Thank you [end]
[start] Would you say your feelings of wanting to quit are a common reason that people leave the force? Because they feel they are on the wrong side, as you say? What are common reasons people quit?  Any thoughts about how to keep people like you from quitting? I hate to say it like this....but we need cops that see the problems, to serve and protect. How can we keep the good guys on board? Is it leadership issues? Pay and benefits? More training? We need cops...but not the cops I'm seeing lately. [end]
[start] youre going to get doxxed to shit bro lol you dont understand the reach some people can get [end]
[start] Good luck, bud [end]
[start] I'm assuming tech support, you don't need to confirm or deny to protect your identity.   Change their passwords. Move desktop icons. Break their outlook profiles. Peaceful resistance.   If I'm wrong in my assumption, my advice still stands. I just can't give specific ideas lol. [end]

[start] What city is it or at least what state? i believe not all police departments are alike. For example, police departments in the northeast or with diverse minority populations are not as racist as down south (where the ku klux klan and related organizations took advantage of the culture there). It appears that messed up way of thinking is stronger in some areas than others. You can also try federal jobs or something, wish I could give you a job, you're a good person for quitting. [end]

[start] You sound like a very decent person [end]

[start] Nothing but respect for law enforcement I feel there is blame on all sides here it's just a tragedy that so much hate is over flowing right now. [end]
[start] Followed [end]
[start] You work in IT in a government office.    Unless you are doing forensics on disk drives as evidence in crime cases I wouldn't really say you are in law enforcement.    Naturally, you hate your job.     I dunno that I trust your interpretation that the cops associated with your department are feeling joy about shooting rubber bullets into crowds, sorry. [end]
[start] I wish you would stick around for another month or so,simply to see if the tides can't be turned and thus we can keep a good officer employed. We need all the good ones we can find right now because there is a very real chance we will be starting over with who the frontline officers are. Having good people in the backend to help heal the inside culture in that transition could be extremely beneficial. [end]
[start] Huh. Why would want to quit? Don't you want to make the world a better place. How does a good police officer leaving help the situation. I feel like I'm missing something here [end]
[start] Why do you even care? It's bound to happen. The protests won't stop until shit gets ugly, and then police will be the one to blame, again. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Please dont quit. I understand the urge, I've been watching officers resign all weekend. If all the moral cops quit.... Who's left to TRY to fix things? [end]
[start] I do not believe you.   Got several cops in my family and they are torn up over all of this. Sad, feeling angry at the guy who started this because all it takes is 1 bad cop to tarnish the good ones.   If you are telling the truth, expose them. They should not be cops to begin with! [end]
[start] Don’t quit!!! We need people like you on the inside!! [end]
[start] I don’t believe anything written after reading all the crap fake news on twitter recently [end]
[start] You should do an AMA with proper proof and everything [end]
[start] I've been down voting all the posts here about how "not all" cops are the problem. Good on you for being a singular voice of honesty in an echo chamber of gas lighting. Cops and police culture are the problem. [end]
[start] Prove it larp [end]
[start] Yea, I’d like to see any proof that you are in fact who you say you are. For all I know this is totally made up. [end]
[start] Resign. Any involvement in being a cop is supporting the oppressive system that cops enforce. The system cannot be changed on the inside, it must be dismantled and completely remade. [end]
[start] I am in a similar position as you, data and project management. Working for the state our group is responsible for the repositories and working closely with the local SOs, municipalities, etc.   I have to completely object to your generalization of this and tell you that it only goes to reinforce the rhetoric and diatribe that the mass media wants everyone to believe... That cops are nothing more than those that peaked in HS and are plain douche bags.   While this may be the constant in your neighborhood, area, region or whatever... IT IS NOT what all cops are like and so you spreading this "bad information" is only going to help the incorrect vision of Law Enforcement. Not all cops are bad, and GOOD COPS hate BAD COPS just as much as everyone else.   If you feel that what you stated is actually happening, it is time for you to go to the station chief, under sheriff, or commander and inform them of what their officers are doing because THEY are the responsible authority. IF You believe that this will fall on deaf ears then you need to take it to the local Internal Affairs lead and inform them. THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING. Just like everyone says that "if you are quiet you are part of the problem" with regards to not speaking out on the racism, you are just as much a part of the problem if you are hearing/seeing the officers doing this.   The south is known for racism... plain and simple, so the generalization that this is how ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT are throughout the US only goes to show your lack of understanding and experience. [end]

[start] > Please, be careful out there when protesting, if you are unarmed and peaceful - you are almost MORE likely to be the target of police violence. The police are being bullies and are taking joy out of this - do not let yourselves be an easy target.   Are you saying the protesters should be armed and not peaceful?  I think this guy is a troll. [end]
[start] Riots can break out in seconds and police that are actually in the field know that these protestors could light like a dry forrest in and instant.  If the police have set up barriers and these protestors do something like run those barriers more are going to follow and the only reason they do is so everyone else thinks they care that much.  If someone decided to assault a cop two more are going to follow suit and within a minute the police could be overrun.  The tear gas and rubber bullets are preventative measures. [end]
[start] I don't see how that pic is proof. I don't like cops but it seems just as likely you are a lonely person who wants attention. Go to AMA and prove yourself, otherwise you are just trying to stoke the fire, you might even be an alt right. I'm highly skeptical of this. [end]
[start] You looking for praise?  It took *this* for you to see how fucked up your people are?  Too little too late.  You're a part of the system.  You've enabled this kind of shit with your silence up to now.  Make up for it or go to hell. [end]

[TITLE] I just saved a lady in my bar from potential sex predators [TITLE]
[start] You’re a real hero [end]
[start] You are a hero. You saved this woman's life. I was drugged and raped twice from going to the bars. I wish I had someone like you there. I don't drink at the bars anymore. [end]
[start] Check her breathing! These drugs can cause people to stop breathing properly and kill them!  After what I'm almost certain was a drugging, I had to carry a female friend of mine to the hospital, and when I got there, she was intubated for days. She nearly died, and my friend jumping in to do a sternum rub and try to wake her is what saved her life.  This is no joke. She likely needs medical attention. [end]
[start] That is a really good de-escalation line. [end]
[start] thank god you went out to look for her, i hope everythings okay [end]
[start] Good move!  Thank you for your quick thinking! [end]
[start] You are a good person. [end]
[start] You are amazing. Thank you. [end]
[start] If only rapists like this ever suffered any real consequences [end]
[start] That's  wonderful what you did but I can guarantee she is not their first victim. Make sure the police is called and you need to do do your best to describe them. Do you have any security footage that can help identify them? In 48 hours they'll be off to new pastures and druging and raping in a different bar. [end]
[start] Thank God for your intuition and quick thinking. My sibling died outside of winter weather exposure. Drugs were put in their alcoholic drink at a rural house party. Numerous people were present and noted the unusual behavior and the sudden absence but did nothing. Toxicology report from the autopsy confirmed the horrible truth.   One concerned person can be the difference between life and death. [end]
[start] Locally, a young woman went to a bar on Dec 20th with coworkers. She was seen leaving the bar "willingly" with two men whom she didn't know. Her last text to her family and friends, late that night, said she didn't know where she was and she was scared. Today she was uncovered in a shallow grave.   Do not doubt for one second that you saved that young woman's life in your bar. Thank you for seeing her as a person, and acting so quickly to get her to safety. [end]

We think that's when he dropped something in the drinks. Luckily this big biker guy walked over after seeing the look in my eyes and acted as my boyfriend and told him to get his hands off his Ol lady. The guy took off thankfully. But we started feeling weird and decided to go back to the hotel. But we lost 9 hours. No memories. I threw up for 48 hours (and I never ever threw up while drinking, even shitfaced, never) I was so sick for days. [end]
[start] OP, thank you for doing the right thing and being smart about it. If you'd said anything else to those degenerates, they could have gotten violent. Making them think it isn't about them at all was clever. [end]
[start] You could have possibly also saved her from Human sex trafficking [end]
[start] Thank you for saving this woman. You saved her from being hurt by men who wanted to hurt her. Thank you for listening to your instincts. Thank you from every woman out there. [end]
[start] I’m too poor to give you Reddit gold, but here’s my poor person’s gold 🥇 [end]
[start] Way to look out for others in need.  Wish there were more people like you out there.  I hope your kindness is repaid to you tenfold! [end]
[start] thank you. you are amazing. we need more women like you. [end]
[start] Good job.  Brave too.  Any chance your bar has cameras?  Even if you don't have footage of them doctoring her drink (which the police would be interested in), your bar and every other bar you can talk to could just ban them for life.  It won't stop them from doing it again somewhere else, but it at least it would protect some girls. [end]
[start] You are a great person. Thank you for being so involved in the care of your customers. Love it. You are a hero. [end]
[start] Very happy you saved her. Next time call the police too. Get those predators arrested to save some other woman [end]
[start] If you ever see those two men again, keep a very close eye on them and call the police if they attempt another kidnapping [end]
[start] thats a good line! [end]
[start] r/tidtrt [end]
[start] You saved this woman from a horrible situation. Thank you. You are a great person and this world needs more people like you. [end]
[start] Thank you for this. I hope this isn't uncommon. But I worry it is. [end]
[start] I just got goosebumps. You are a hero and thank you so much for that. [end]
[start] Bravo [end]
[start] Way to go!  Thank you OP! [end]
[start] A true HUMAN BEAN!!! You potentially saved someone’s life girl! Kudos to you doing the right thing and following your gut! It goes to show how women do have. Six sense and you should NEVET IGNORE IT! It’s saved MY life a couple times! [end]
[start] > I went up to them, tap them at the back and say “she is suspected of stealing, i have called the cops and i need her back in to wait for the cops arrival” and the guys bolted off.    Did you just think of that off the top of your head or is that a known bartender trick? [end]
[start] Awesome! Good job! Thank you for watching out for her. [end]
[start] Thank you for your quick actions and damn always trust your gut feeling since it seems to be spot on!! You're truly an amazing person and I hope wherever you work it's gets known that you are a ally and that women can know they are safe there!! I was once drugged at a party and a man saw, swapped out my beer, informed the host who called the police and managed to keep the guy busy long enough til the got there actually asking him about drugging ladies drinks!! You truly saved her life by your actions!! [end]
[start] You did well. Just curious what is her drink of choice? [end]
[start] You did great [end]
[start] Whoa...way to go! You totally saved her [end]
[start] Good job. Nice save. I’m sure her night would have had a different outcome had you not intervened. [end]
[start] Wow, follow up is wonderful. [end]
[start] You are the bartender we all need but not the one we all deserve. Good job. [end]
[start] hero [end]
[start] You are a Hero!! [end]
[start] You should also post this on r/TwoXChromosomes. You're a legend. 💖  May I ask, are these men on camera? [end]
[start] This is amazing. [end]
[start] You are a hero.  This is the way. [end]
[start] You are a great human! [end]
[start] Way to go OP, a hero and clever too :) Hell yeah! [end]
[start] Thank God you listened to your gut and checked up on her.  I shudder to think what could have happened.  Your customers are lucky to have you as their bartender.  God bless! [end]
[start] YOU ARE AWESOME!!!  You have no way of knowing but you may have saved a life. [end]
[start] Humanity was a mistake. [end]
[start] Good for you. One of the unknown side benefits of being a regular. [end]
[start] Where were you when this happened to me. The hospital staff didn’t believe me and none of the taxis would take me from what I was told. The main bouncer (a close friend) had to take me in his managers own personal vehicle.  I don’t even remember leaving my drink [end]
[start] We need more people like you [end]
[start] Can't thank you enough for your diligence.  We live in a time of fucking lazy ass weirdo rapists and people who want all the luxury of someone who works hard without having to work hard. So thanks. [end]
[start] Everyone needs a bartender like you. You probably saved this young ladies life. When I think of what could have happened to her without you knowing your customers...You are a hero! [end]
[start] Wow that is awesome quick thinking on your part claiming that she was accused of stealing and the cops were on their way *hi-5* [end]
[start] A good bartender knows how to make drinks and knows the regulars.  A great bartender (like OP) also looks out for their regulars like this.  I'm also sure she looks out for shady assholes as well. [end]
[start] Vh TGi [end]
[start] Thank you for looking out for fellow humans, not many people have the courage to do what you did. [end]
[start] Great job!!! You are a hero. [end]
[start] A real hero. Glad to hear such great deed. Made my morning [end]
[start] Thank you for being the smart, attentive, & caring bartender! I know her & her loved ones are appreciative! [end]
[start] Thank you! 💖 [end]
[start] Best bartender ever [end]
[start] Hey thanks for being a decent human being. [end]
[start] You are a sweetheart and a hero. Such a sweet and special person. Thank you for being you. Your husband is or will be lucky to have such a witty, caring person is his life [end]
[start] always listen to you’re gut. [end]
[start] Thank you so much for going to check on her! You are amazing. [end]
[start] You are amazing. Well done. I don’t know if I could have been so quick in the moment. [end]
[start] Real genius hero 🦸‍♀️ [end]
[start] Great work friend, you have gone above and beyond here. Your initiative and quick thinking may have saved your regulars life. As a bar manager myself, you are exactly the sort of person I want on my team. Stay awesome! [end]
[start] Literal hero [end]
[start] tbh if I were you, i would’ve taken one look at those guys dragging her off and kicked each of them in the balls. [end]
[start] You did an incredible thing for that woman!  Those guys definitely were not her friends if they bolted when you told them you had called the cops on her. Real friends would have stayed and defended her/been moral support.  You undoubtedly saved her from being raped. Thank you! [end]
[start] Did you get cctv of the guys? Well done on your observations [end]
[start] r/humansbeingbros [end]
[start] Just another thank you from a random person scanning through posts and comments out of boredom. We all need to look out for each other or keep looking out for each other like this. [end]
[start] Thank you for being awesome. [end]
[start] it's a good thing you were there or when she woke up this morning her asshole would have looked like a pickle jar [end]
[start] You helped your guest/friend. Thank you. [end]
[start] I hope she will be ok! You are amazing!!! [end]
[start] This makes me so happy, I wish all bartenders were this caring. On NYE a bartender kicked me out of a bar because I would not kiss his friend :( [end]
[start] Everyone should be more like you.  Peace. [end]
[start] So, you let them get away?! They’re only going to try this again with some other woman. Hell, they may have already done it and gotten away with assaulting/raping another. Are there security cameras in your bar? [end]
[start] Was she roofied? [Date rape drug] [end]
[start] Certainly they can, but the two guys she scared off, that I was suggesting be banned, were targeting a female patron.  I suppose there must be troves bisexual rapists out there drugging every drink they can get close to.  Thanks for pointing out the facts, despite the lack of relevance to OPs post or my comment.  Perhaps you could dedicate some of your apparently vast knowledge to solving other problems that plague society, like the lack of dedicated private healthcare for billionaires or the wide spread wave of clown on clown crime. [end]
[start] Lo she called an ambulance for nothing. [end]
[start] Fantastic awareness! You saved her for sure. [end]
[start] You're so good person I can't even imagine :) [end]
[start] Honestly the way you got rid of them was really clever [end]
[start] I aspire to be this clever in life [end]
[start] Way to go! Beautiful! [end]
[start] Herrrroooo!! [end]
[start] Thank you for being so perceptive and acting on your suspicion. Thats very admirable. [end]
[start] God damn, awesome work! [end]
[start] You are an angel and you did exactly the right thing. Kudos to you for taking care of this young lady so well. [end]
[start] You are beyond amazing [end]
[start] Males are so gross [end]
[start] God bless you man [end]
[start] Fucking worthless pieces of slime fucking shit.   Fuck [end]
[start] It’s funny that people are like “call the ambulance”. She clearly wrote this long after this was resolved your suggestions only help you feel like a hero. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Fake [end]
[start] Kudos to you, very good, human being.  Watching out for others.  But obviously the lady drinks too much. [end]
[start] cock blocker [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] It just sounds like she had a drink or two (or some pills) before she came in and then your paranoid anti-male gender bias made you lie to some random guys. Great story. A true hero. [end]
[start] Maybe just maybe it’s possible that she wanted to have sex with 2 guys... and you ruined  her fantasy. Iv been so shitfaced plenty of times and despite being incoherent and completley zombie  I still want to get laid in that moment believe it or not [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[TITLE] Update! [TITLE]
[start] Things come full circle! So excited to have you join the WeWork family. Welcome Victoria! [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I foresee some awkward elevator rides. [end]
[start] YouWork at WeWork now? ThatWorks for MeWorks. [end]
[start] Congratulations!  Although you're essentially a stranger on the internet, it has felt like we have a vested interest in your success. You're like a cousin that I really don't know that well that I am still concerned for when things aren't going well for them.  You're under no obligation to keep us updated, but I appreciate the update. Your updates are the Christmas letter from that cousin. :)  I'm happy to update your RES tag removing "former reddit..." from the descriptor. :) [end]
[start] CONGRATS! So happy that you found something that utilizes your talents and passions. You're going to do a fantastic job there. [end]
[start] How exciting! We could really use a WeWork in Houston. *hint hint* [end]
[start] http://i.imgur.com/hwTRTFp.gif [end]
[start] Moving in [like a boss](http://i.imgur.com/JRzrXR6.gifv). [end]
[start] Dear Victoria,    your work on the AMA's has meant so much to me.  As someone who's somewhat disabled, I don't get out as much as I'd like, and AMA's were a way for me to occupy my brain.  I just wanted to say thank you.  The way you could make me hear people's voices in my head as I'm reading answers was due to your skills.    Thank you ever so much and good luck on this next season in your life! [end]
[start] Good work. Well done and congrats. :) [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Oh so THAT'S what WeWork is! I work right down the block on Hudson street and pass that huge, open floor space every day, and have never been able to figure out what the hell goes on down there. One day it's a book fair, the next it's some kind of movie screening venue, or a lecture hall. I'd love to stop in one day and see it for myself. Best of luck! [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Congrats! So what will you be doing as director of digital community? What kind of things are you thinking will help strengthen the culture of their online platform? [end]
[start] Is this thread about things in general or ~~Rampa~~ WeWork in particular?  Congrats :) [end]
[start] Congrats! As a small entrepreneur from a small city too far away to participate in the main WeWork locations, would you guys ever consider sort of "outpost" type affiliations with maker spaces in smaller cities so we can join in the community you are building? Bloomington-Normal, IL here :)  [end]
[start] Go to their website. Top right.  "I am a"  TIS FATE!  Congrats Victoria!    [end]
[start] I will be on my deathbed and i'm still going to wonder why were you fired... [end]
[start] *Is* WeWork like a startup incubator, like from Silicon Valley?  *e:* [end]
[start] Congratulations!  [end]
[start] Hey Victoria, I'm going to miss working with you on AMAs but I'm STOKED that you ended up at such a cool spot. Onwards! [end]
[start] So... what's the status of WeWork  AMA's?   [end]
[start] Congratulations!  I'm very excited for you! [end]
[start] Congratulations. Best of luck in the new position!  [end]
[start] Congratulations! I know we all hope you get all the awesomeness that you deserve. :) [end]
[start] Congratulations! [end]
[start] Good to see you landed in a familiar place, with the same commute! [end]
[start] I worked at a Wework location in Seattle for a bit. It was an excellent office environment. Your personality will suit them well!  [end]
[start] C O N G R A T S  O  N  G  R  A  T  S [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Congrat on your new job! You're awesome. [end]
[start] I'm so glad you updated all of us who have been wondering and worried about you after that debacle that happened.  Not like we didn't know you'd land on your feet, haha.  Congratulations! [end]
[start] Victoria! I want to say congrats here too along with the other place I've said congrats!  [end]
[start] This is awesome. I'm so happy for both you and WeWork. Great fit! [end]
[start] I know this isn't an AMA, but I'm about to go to NYC for the first time. Where should I get pizza? [end]
[start] Congratulations! I'm actually going to NYC this September, maybe I should visit WeWork? [end]
[start] Congrats! How cool is all of that?   As someone in the Seattle market who's had some brief experience with WeWork spaces, do you have any suggestions on joining WW in the community or expansion departments? I've always been fairly customer and community driven in my roles, and the culture of WeWork seems pretty awesome. [end]
[start] Congratulations!, ¡Felicidades! I have to say, yours is one of the most contagious smiles I've ever seen. Keep on being amazing, Victoria!  [end]
[start] Well, this will certainly make it easier to bug you if I find myself in NYC again.  There's a hotel right across the street from that building :)  (Congrats!) [end]
[start] So, you'll still get to see your friends (not being sarcastic) from the Reddit offices around? That's neat! [end]
[start] I was lucky enough to write the Game of Thrones post when we said goodbye as your watch ended.  I am so glad to see that a new watch has begun for you! Please accept every wish for meaningful and satisfying labor. [end]
[start] Still interested in the bookclub? We have exciting news. :)  [end]
[start] Great to see you back on your feet, you'll surely be an excellent Director of Digital Community there, good luck! [end]
[start] Is there any way your dedicated followers here can show support via your new employer? You earned all this street cred... might as well use it! [end]
[start] You did an AMAZING job with AMAs and you've been an absolutely integral component in building reddit into what it is today.    Please keep some notes for all the AMAs you worked on!  You could easily write a collection of stories about all the fascinating people you interacted with (Robbin Williams being a favorite of mine).  I'd love to read it.   I can't wait to see what you do with your new job and we wish you the best of luck. [end]
[start] I wish you the best, friend. [end]
[start] Don't forget us when you're rich and famous! [end]
[start] Congratulations, wish you all the best. [end]
[start] I'm happy to hear you're excited for the new job! Can't wait to see how you help the company grow! [end]
[start] I noticed on the website that they have pictures of a lot of different workspaces, but the only bathroom related thing I saw was showers. Am I understanding that wework does not provide toilets, only showers?  [end]
[start] Welcome Victoria! You'll love it at WeWork! [end]
[start] Congratulations! Hope this new direction takes you amazing places :) [end]
[start] Congrats and Best of Luck!  [end]
[start] Congratulations :D Best of luck with this exciting new phase of your life.  [end]
[start] As sad as I am to see you leave Reddit, I'm happy you're moving on to bigger and better things!  I know you'll do an absolutely fantastic job at WeWork and I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to work with you :) [end]
[start] wow the rent prices are pretty damn reasonable.  [end]
[start] Fantastic news! Congratulations on your new gig :) [end]
[start] Congratulations hope everything goes well for you! [end]
[start] Congrats Victoria!!! [end]
[start] Congrats! I wish you well, and I'm glad everything is turning out positively for you :) [end]
[start] Glad to see that everything worked out for you. You deserve it, honestly.  [end]
[start] Congrats! Co-worker of mine met you during a Friday reddit lunch (we work at a newspaper in Westchester). She'll be glad to hear you're still going to be in NYC! [end]
[start] I read "Lisa Kudrow" but clicked on Weird Al.  Was distressed.  "Oh man, she's aging badly :(" [end]
[start] Yay! Congratulations! [end]
[start] I worked out of a WeWork building in NYC last summer and it was great, and it will get even better now that you're working there.  [end]
[start] Best of luck to you! [end]
[start] I'm glad you found out what you wanted to do, congratulations ! [end]
[start] Gratz!!!! [end]
[start] I like chimichangas.   [end]
[start] Many many congratulations. I hope you are happy in your new position and wish you nothing but success in your future. Many thanks again for everything you done for Reddit/ors. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Awesome!  Congrats!    &nbsp;  EDIT: Edited to add that Chattanooga would be a good place for a WeWork location.  Gigabyte fiber optic internet, a city that is openly trying to lure tech startups, VW, Amazon, possibly Google within spitting distance soon... Also, beautiful mountains, rivers and lakes. :D [end]
[start] Thank you very much for updating us.  I'm delighted but not surprised that you've been snapped up so quickly.  WeWork is lucky to have you!  Best wishes in all aspects of life.  :) [end]
[start] So you're not even changing buildings? Kick ass!  [end]
[start] Wonderful news! Congrats to you. While your great work will be missed here, I wish you all the best in your new endeavor. I really admire how you handled yourself during what must have been a very stressful time for you. Thanks for the update, it's really nice to witness the cream rising to the top. You are a Choo-Choo Charlie and a class act, Chooter! [end]
[start] Hurrey!  [end]
[start] Congratulations, it sounds like WeWork is the perfect home for you. Thanks for your time here, the AMAs you worked on were on another level and you'll be always missed. [end]
[start] Awesome! Good luck! Now if only we can turn that WeWork visit into a possible WeWork internship.. Hint hint :P  [end]
[start] >From Jerry Seinfeld   to Lisa Kudrow, Weird Al  to Lily Allen, Ron Perlman to Ludacris  Psst, your age is showing. I recommend editing your post to namedrop Bernie Sanders and Elon Musk. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Can you get me a job there? [end]
[start] Congratulations and best of luck to you! [end]
[start] Today is Lisa Kudrow's birthday.  You should reach out to her. [end]
[start] BEST NEWS EVER!!! Congrats!!! [end]
[start] love, love, love this. [end]
[start] Congratulations!  [end]
[start] grats  [end]
[start] Good luck, Victoria! You're awesome!  And you're awesome for responding to everyone here congratulating you! [end]
[start] Victoria, we've only communicated one time, and you obvious communicate with A LOT of people, so no problem if you don't remember me. I messaged you to see about getting info for setting a world record via Reddit for most cars fixed for free before, and you took the time to point me in the right direction, and for that, thank you! Good luck on all your adventures! :D [end]
[start] You sound so kind and friendly that I am actually impressed.  [end]
[start] There was no doubt in any of our minds how easy it would be for you to find another job.  Congrats and I sincerely hope WeWork know the caliber of person they have just been blessed with!  Later Gator! [end]
[start] Congratulations Victoria! Good things happening to good people makes me happy :> [end]
[start] Should have quoted Rob Ryan in your firing: "I'll be out of work for about 5 minutes" [end]
[start] Congrats! I find myself in an NYC WeWork pretty much every other week, nice to see the name up in bright lights here on reddit. [end]
[start] Congratulations, Chooter. You absolutely deserve the title, and we all know you'll be the BEST director anyone could ask for. [end]
[start] why is there *never* beer in any of the 4 taps in wework bryant park? [end]
[start] This message is to We work top brass:  The entirety of the Reddit community thinks /u/chooter deserves a raise.  And maybe an extra week of vacation. We look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.   Warmest regards,  Everyone  [end]
[start] I wish co-working hubs like this had been around when I ran a small business. It sucked doing everything from our bedrooms or client offices.  This is a great fit for you. If you have plans to visit the space in DC, I'll treat you to something at one of our many cool places in town! :) You really made Reddit extra special with your awesome talents. Congratulations to you and wish you the best. And thank you for the update. Much appreciated. [end]
[start] Great to hear you landed on your feet!  Well done all around and they're lucky to have ya.   [end]
[start] Aw, I used to work at a restaurant around the corner! You ever been to the Mae Mae Cafe for lunch? [end]
[start] Very cool! My startup was looking for a coworking space last year. WeWork has a great reputation but unfortunately it was all booked up (at least the one on Park Ave) so we had chose another. Best of luck! [end]
[start] Let's try and keep this about RAMPART. [end]
[start] Congratulations Victoria :)  [end]
[start] You answered like every post.... You're amazing!  Oh and congratulations and all the best. [end]
[start] Congratulations, we are happy for you Vic <3  [end]
[start] Weird Al looks baked [end]
[start] Open a WeWork space in Denver!  Galvanize could use a little competition in the city. [end]
[start] So glad to see you're doing well! Do you think it will be awkward running into former coworkers or higher-ups from Reddit in the elevators? [end]
[start] I am so excited for you! Congrats Victoria! [end]
[start] Excellent!  Best of success to you in your new career! [end]
[start] It took me a bit to understand what WeWork was about.   It looks nice! And of course it had to have offices in Tel Aviv and Amsterdam. Any plans to expand to other cities in the Netherlands or in Germany?  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Is there a reason it's "not deserve" rather than "don't deserve"? [end]
[start] congrats victoria! [end]
[start] Did we loose /u/chooter or did we win more than we lost?  /confused and afraid.  Congratulations on finding a great new job! You're going to fit right in. [end]
[start] There's no WeWork in Budapest : ((( [end]
[start] http://www.fastcompany.com/3049261/fast-feed/ex-reddit-figure-victoria-taylor-joins-wework [end]
[start] I am surprised you don't have any offices in San Jose, Palo Alto or mountain view. But sf. To me the trendier startups are in sf while the ones which last longer are further down to the South Bay.  [end]
[start] Congratulations! [end]
[start] Congrats! [end]
[start] I really dig the concept. Cheap rent in central locations + networking possibilities, really interesting.  Hopefully you'll open something in Paris too! First *apéro* on me. [end]
[start] Hell yeah! I hope you have many more awesome things happen in your future! Congratulations! [end]
[start] I'm pretty sure my brother rents office space for his indie game collective from you guys! Seems like a great company, congrats! [end]
[start] Congrats Victoria! AMA with your assistance was always awesome. I'm sure that you will also do awesome things in your new position!  cheers... [end]
[start] /r/uplifting [end]
[start] You should do an AMA! [end]
[start] The website needs a way to subscribe to a WeWork opening within X miles of you.  Please add this feature, so I can use it. [end]
[start] Congrats on the new gig! Is that the same WeWork office that has the model of Springfield form The Simpsons? [end]
[start] This makes me so happy. [end]
[start] If you're still looking at comments what is WeWork exactly? I've looked at the website and I can sort-of think it's office spaces? [end]
[start] Congrats!!!! [end]
[start] Always wanted to know, what's your typing speed? [end]
[start] So how quickly does Reddit crash the wework website by visiting it ;) [end]
[start] This is awesome.  The company I am on-board onto next week is in the china town DC office. [end]
[start] (Only 22 hours late)  Congrats! Best of luck and lots of happiness at your new job! [end]
[start] Victoria was THE reason for me to visit Reddit. AMAs were a great experience thanks to you. Also, was surreal to see you linking to my question. :) [end]
[start] All the best for your future :) [end]
[start] Good luck and thanks for everything you contributed to Reddit.  [end]
[start] Cool, my company is based out of WeWorks in SF. Pretty awesome place. [end]
[start] Congratulations! Glad you landed on your feet. [end]
[start] I appreciate how you replied to so many people even tho you didn't have to it makes me happy. :)  [end]
[start] Congrats V! Sounds like a great gig. WeWork is lucky to have you :) [end]
[start] Congrats!  Hope you enjoy your new job :-) [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Like any good technology worker. You work for three companies in 5 years without changing desks.  [end]
[start] Sorry if I might sound dumb, but i'm quite interested in this maybe later on in the years,because I'm only in 15 right now so can you explain what wework is, I did check the website but I'm still kinda confused as to what it does and also the discounts and stuff does it mean its partnered with other companies too? [end]
[start] Brooklyn in the house! I believe, based on my internet skills that it is not a surprise that you are rocking this in NYC and, i expect asap that your new place will be in Bushwick!!! [end]
[start] lol RIP ATF. congrats victoria  >Admin posts  >Reddit administrators, we would appreciate if you send us a message a little bit before you post (if we don't reply, no big deal). We won't get mad if you don't, but cmon, be a bro. [end]
[start] Congratulations on the new job, at which I have no doubt you will excel. Maybe I'll stop by someday, just to give you a hug and tell you how awesome you are. [end]
[start] Congratulations on the new job! [end]
[start] So glad you found something so quickly. This sounds like a great fit for you Victoria. Best of luck! [end]
[start] Glad you landed on your feet, so to speak.  [end]
[start] Tossing another "congrats" on the pile.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] That's fantastic!  Sounds like a great fit - WeWork is amazing and so are you.  Totally stopping by. [end]
[start] Great news, good for you. But that I don't see myself using WeWork anytime soon. [end]
[start] Awesome! Congratulations, Victoria! [end]
[start] Congratulations!  I hope you have a great time working there!  [end]
[start] Congrats! Stay in touch with us :) [end]
[start] Awesome. Congratulations on the new job! [end]
[start] Congrats Victoria! Glad to hear it [end]
[start] Congrats! I'll definitely drop by next time I'm in NYC :D [end]
[start] You met Lily Allen?  What was her third nipple like?     And congratulations!! [end]
[start] I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

[start] Glad you found something that you will let you use your full talents :) Read hundreds of AMA thank you for helping open a window into so many interesting people, that we would have never had without you. [end]
[start] Congrats. Glad you landed on your feet. [end]
[start] Good luck! I hope it works out. I'd just be careful about the culture of the company instead. I've heard that WeWork doesn't respect its employees and works people 12+ hour days until they quit and that management sets unreasonable goals and timeframes. [end]
[TITLE] I'm a police officer and I'd like to make a comment about George Floyd [TITLE]
[start] The fact that 4 officers were there, George was already on the ground, handcuffed, and that officer still wanted to have his knee on George’s neck for so many minutes shows something wasn’t right.   Why they made no effort to place him in the car is baffling. And the fact that he kept his knee on George’s neck even after he passed out is disgusting. [end]
[start] Guy needs to be charged with murder. That's how this gets solved. [end]
[start] It’s not police brutality anymore, it’s MURDER. [end]
[start] George and the officer who killed him worked together as security for the same restaurant for 7 years. (Just saying, this is personal, which makes it worse.) Source: interview with Andrea Jenkins, MN City Council VP. [end]
[start] All over a $20 dollar check...   This man lost his life over $20 dollars. [end]
[start] I’ve been dying to ask this. Can you tell us a little bit about what your department is doing to ensure its officers aren’t the next Derek Chauvin? What training does one receive regarding the handling of suspects after they are handcuffed? What sort of conversations are being held about the incident amongst the police department (both internally, cop between cop, and externally, city’s police department and other law enforcement divisions)?   I am truly curious to hear from a police officer regarding the situation. Thanks in advance for the effort [end]
[start] Police are for apprehending.  *Courts* are for punishing. [end]
[start] Unfortunately most police departments have an attitude of "we protect our own"  which is why we need an outside agency to investigate things like this. [end]
[start] I'm not an "ACAB" type, but my question is do you say this in public, to other cops, to reporters? Or just here anonymously online? [end]
[start] When I see the cop with his knee on that poor mans throat I’m totally it’s clear the cops a monster but I’m baffled by Tao the other cop standing watching tbh , this makes it normality that they probably work this way with anyone not just people of colour and maybe that’s why they have so many complaints against them .  Question - does anyone look through bodycam footage from police or is it just if the cop flags something up ??? [end]
[start] The other three officers deserved to be tried as accessories. Ask yourself, and think hard about this, if you were on the job and a colleague of yours was acting with reckless abandon for human life, would you intervene to stop them? Would you have been willing to pull your weapon to stop Derek chauvin from murdering George floyd? [end]
[start] i could see a smile as he was killing him. i think he wanted him dead.. [end]
[start] Just to explain further: the so-called forgery here was the use of a **suspected** fake $20 note at a deli Floyd had frequented regularly and the owner noted he was always pleasant and may not have even known the $20 note was a counterfeit.  He was murdered for a suspected counterfeit $20. Fucking disgusting. [end]
[start] If you are in fact a police officer, thank you for this. [end]
[start] More cops need to speak the fuck up.  Even if this wasn’t your unit, the world is lumping you all together.  Like you all need to speak up and become a vocal majority that leads this fight against these fucking stupid cops.  The amount of silence from police officers makes it look like you’re on this racist douche bags side it’s amazing how little I’ve seen of y’all on social media [end]
[start] Would you have prevented that cop from killing that man with his knee if you were one of the four officers just standing around? [end]
[start] Listen up. MANY people do not realize they have a counterfeit bill. He could have gotten that bill anywhere and the convenience store happened to realize it. I used to be a teller and had plenty of folks of all walks of life bring in counterfeit bills of various denominations without realizing it.   It is a fucking shame that a man lost his life over of counterfeit bill. [end]
[start] If you have 10 bad cops and 100 good cops, but the 100 good cops turn the other cheek to the 10 bad cops injustice, you have 110 bad cops. [end]
[start] Lol we wouldnt put up with an officer like that... what one that murders? I HOPE NOT. Your department isn't better than any other. Until your group as whole chooses to stand behind justice, instead of eachother in every situation, you personally and your department look equally culpable in my eyes. The biggest gang in the country is you and your coworkers. [end]
[start] As a outsider living in the US now for over 20 years I hear this argument all the time.  The punishment rarely fits the crime and a lot of people I talk to are OK with that.    They tell me he/she should have complied, shouldn't have broken the law.      It's an insane argument.   Nothing justifies police brutality. Breaking the law doesn't mean they get to kill you.    The police in this country almost always gets away with murder and one of the reasons why I no longer think the US is a civilized country. [end]
[start] How many of these “I’m a police officer and here’s my two cents” posts do we have to endure before they realize that we don’t give a shit what they have to say? Their actions are loud enough. Get out of the comments and into streets, SHOWING how your “well-run department” protects and serves its community [end]
[start] Thanks hero, now say it publicly [end]
[start] I don't understand haw Chauvin is not just in prison awaiting trial right now.  Or at least in custody.  I know there's bodycam footage but I just don't see any way that seeing the situation from a different angle could possibly exonerate the guy.  It's not like what was in the original video was obscured behind the car, or behind people. [end]
[start] I agree with your words here, now write a statement and go around state by state getting people to fucking sign it.  Do something tangible or your words are meaningless. You cops have a LOT of bad faith to make up for. [end]
[start] “The crime he was accused of doing wasn’t that serious”  Even if it was police officers are not part of the punishment process. [end]
[start] I appreciate this sentiment from a cop. And I agree with you.   However, you reinforced the accusation that he forged money. And I have deep issues with that.   I’ll speak from personal experience. There’s a massive difference between using forged funds and forging money.   I have a high school friend serving 20+ in prison for forging money and then getting caught telling people how to forge money on a prison phone.   He gave the fake cash to people and they spent it.  The police response was absolutely different between the two. Cops just questioned the people in a non confrontational manner when they got caught using forged notes. It was a conversation, force wasn’t used and Secret Service was called after they all got back to the station.   My ex-buddy got raided by federal agents. Definitely deserved.   I’m not an ACAB person, but the state of policing I’ve seen deeply saddens me. I’m a white dude and I’ve been treated like I was automatically a criminal by American police during the encounters I’ve had with them.   Then it comes out I’m military and suddenly we’re buddy-buddy. I get spoken to like we’re a higher tier level of people than everyone else. It’s us against the plebs. This has happened in a couple different states and is not isolated to a singular organization. That mentality and any similar race/occupational prejudice needs to go. I am no better than the average dude. Cops are no better than the average dude. We are doing jobs. That’s it.   I expect you to **NEVER** exceed the speed limit if you pull people over for it. If you break that law but enforce it, you’re a hypocrite. Doing the same thing you penalize people for deepens the divide of “us against them,” even if you don’t realize it.   I can’t yell at my troop for breaking the same rules I break. They’ll lose trust in me and rightly form the opinion that I am only there to enforce rules, not follow them.   I understand that you work in what you believe to be a decent department, but if you don’t police your peers’ actions and they don’t police yours, every one of your are part of the problem.   Back to the actual event that spurred your post, imagine that you got a forged $10/$20 bill as cash back/change from a gas station attendant that didn’t give a fuck and you didn’t notice it was potentially fake. What would you do if you encountered the same deadly treatment as this man? Would you say something along the lines of “I promise I didn’t do it! I’m a cop!”  Until I see country-wide changes in how cops treat people, I won’t trust you. Or your coworkers. Or any cop. I’ll be honest. It’s been proven time and time again that you fuck us non-cops and the system protects you. The Supreme Court has even ruled that you aren’t here to protect and serve, even if it’s on your car.  I honestly look forward to hearing what you have to say. I’d love to know if you follow every law that you enforce. I want to know if you turn a blind eye to small infractions that other officers commit that would be a ticket for a regular person. You break the speed limit in that cruiser when not on a call? Even if you don’t reply, think deeply about it. And if your honest answer is rainbows and butterflies, you might be part of the one and only perfect police departments in the nation. [end]
[start] I read a lot of comments that if good cops know about bad cops and do nothing about them, they're ALL bad cops. You guys do either know, or at least strongly suspect, who the bad cops are (IMO). They make your job FAR more dangerous as well as put the lives of citizens in jeopardy. What should be done to purge them from your ranks? [end]
[start] But this keeps happening, and will continue to happen. What are you guys going to do to stop this from happening again? Because as far as the rest of us are concerned, it looks like you guys are just sitting around with your thumbs up your asses waiting for this to blow over, just like the last time it happened, and the time it happened before that. When are you "good cops" going to band together to publicly condemn these murders? When are you "good cops" going to band together to purge yourselves of these bad cops? Because right now, you guys are taking ZERO action about this. [end]
[start] For whatever reason, this post made me think of that Mike Tyson quote: "Everyone's got a plan until they get punched in the mouth". I bet most police officers in this country think they work for well-run departments and wouldn't put up with this kind of thing. [end]
[start] Saying this anonymously like this means you're still part of the blue wall of silence. Just once I'd like to see some cops in uniform protesting on camera when one of their own commits murder. [end]
[start] Please stand up as an ally every time you get. Minorities need to see police officers defending them in front of other police officers. Silence is complicity. Thank you for acknowledging something that many officers don’t. [end]
[start] Your words mean nothing unless you take action. So, what are you going to DO about it? Anything? [end]
[start] You really want to convince us that this sort of behavior isn't tolerated? You really want to show us that not all cops are crooked murders?  Start by not protecting the assholes that do this. Treat them as the pieces of shit they are, but publicly, visibly, audibly. Don't protect comrades that become the criminals they are sworn to enforce the law against.   Behavior like Derek Chauvin's didn't exist in a vacuum. His behavior was not only allowed, it was encouraged by the police culture in this country. It needs to stop, today. And change needs to come from within.   You really want to convince us you're one of the "good ones" and not all cops are corrupt? Stop masturbating the hivemind on reddit. Instead, go public. Sing it from the hills, at the top of your lungs, that this is not the job you were sworn to do, and that police culture needs to change. It means a lot more coming from one of you, than one of us faceless civilians.  Put your money where your mouth is. And encourage your colleagues to do the same.   Words are wind. Actions speak louder. [end]
[start] Thanks for protecting and serving your community if you are a police officer and your department is well run. Use your position to help the situation the best you can. Thank you [end]
[start] The president just threatened to use the military to shoot and kill protesters on twitter [end]
[start] What a fucking shitpost. It doesn't take a detective to know that what they did was murder, anyone with even half a brain would know that. Your comment as a "police officer" means absolutely nothing in this situation, you're offering no new insight into this. [end]
[start] Fuck you and your job. You are all bad cops. [end]
[start] My dad is a retired police detective. He worked for a very well trained department. He always makes a point of telling anyone who will listen that police officers are not trained to act in this horrible manner, and that it is not necessary.   The man loves being able to demonstrate taking down a perp, and never seems to understand why deadly force is necessary.   Thank you for speaking out, on behalf of all of us who support “good cops”. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I don't understand why any crime committed by a black person is treated like it's the worst crime on the planet, and that white people make comments like "he shouldn't have committed that crime" or "he shouldn't have resisted arrest" when those same people ALLOW CEOs and politicians to commit whatever crime they want and chalk it up to "that's just how it works". [end]
[start] I want to believe you are a good cop but I can't believe there are any good cops anymore. How do I know you wouldn't have been one of the 80 cops in MPD that are currently protecting the murderer? There are no good cops. Quit the force, pig. [end]

[start] It doesn’t make you a good person because you wouldn’t tolerate a murder. That just makes you a human. You shouldn’t pat yourself on the back for that [end]
[start] Do you think the cop will die? [end]
[start] Also, the crime he was arrested for, is a non-violent / non-contact crime. That in itself should govern what the "threat level" is, or is not. [end]
[start] I hope you're right - the world needs more police not being thugs.   But Lets say you had a colleague -  another police officer you've been working with for 10 years.  He's a good guy and 'one of the boys'.  You watch football games in living rooms at department parties and go to BBQ's and maybe play on the same pickup basketball or softball team. SO one day you get called you're maybe the 3rd car to arrive. Your colleague was in a bit of a skirmish (it happens) with a black guy in a prking lot at a plaza. The black guy tried to bolt and your colleague gets pulled down in the tussle but he's ok and is on top of the guy.    Maybe your pall in the skirmish bumped himself a bit and he's fucking mad at this black guy. SO maybe he pins him down roughly.   People in the parking lot start yelling.  The black guy's not resisting but he's yelling back "Fuck you I didn't do anything!" but all your colleague does is lean on his back or neck or twist his arms up to his shoulder blades causing the black guy to scream and writhe in pain.   The Crowd gathering is getting more vocal and so you have half an eye on your colleague and the pinned-and-immobilized black guy, and half an eye on the screaming people with a cell phone.   You know the black guy is now safely immobilized. He's been frisked on the ground and has no weapons.  A couple cops help cuff him and lean on him too.    Now you have 3 colleagues putting their weight on the black guy he starts saying "I can't breathe!" .  They keep yelling back "stop resisting!"  and then good guy cop #1 aggressively squishes black guy's face into the pavement so he can't speak anymore.     You're helping the situation by monitoring the bystanders along with 3 other police officers who showed up and have now formed a perimeter of the scene.  Now it's been a good 45 seconds since the 3 big athletic cops who 'know how to handle themselves' have immobilized the guy - a skinny 18 year old black kid.  I wrestled in school I know some great dirty shit you can do to a guy when you're laying on him that can't be seen by any ref. Colleague #1 has done a few of these things because he's pissed he scraped up his elbow or something during the takedown.  So it's a scene where it's been a bit rough, a bit edgy, certainly the cops got a few good licks in, in very subtle ways while on the black guy. But no cops on the scene are 'bad guys' per se - they are in an escalating situation and they've roughed him up a bit as the group of cops got bigger.    Do you turn to those police officers - the 3 on the black guy and the other few around doing perimeter control and say "OK guys he's had enough and he's obviously no threat so how about you pick him up off the ground and put him into the back of the car".    Do you do that?  Do you seriously step up and resist the group thug action that is spontaneously forming - that extremely tight group of pals, knowing they'll be fucking pissed at you for questioning them? Knowing the boss is going to be asking "WTF Happened here it's all over Twitter" and there's 5 or 6 cops not stepping up to de-escalate... just you?   Maybe you do - maybe you're that one cop in a thousand who figures he'll risk being labeled as 'not a team player' by the pals.  But I doubt it.  Because the camaraderie is too high.  So you don't say a fucking thing.    When there's a review of what happened - you take the line that you've all discussed and rehearsed the few days following as you sit in your squad cars pulled up beside each other head-to-tail in the parking lot next shift. [end]
[start] It's always "This would never happen in my precinct.  We have a well-run department."  Their division is always perfect and the problem is always somewhere else.  Yet, given enough time and shit hits the fan, they circle the wagons and protect themselves before anyone else since we know now that they have no obligation to protect anyone else. [end]
[start] Okay, now get the other good cops to speak out against it then. [end]
[start] Plus he’s killed other suspects, and has had almost 20 complaints against him.  You’d think after 5, 10, or 15 complaints the department would say “maybe this guy isn’t fit to be a cop.” But no, let’s wait until he murders someone. [end]
[start] it's psychotic behavior to be that nonchalant and smiley while killing someone. he needs to be put in a psych ward asap. if he doesn't face consequences he'll just do it again [end]
[start] Then get on the other side of the picket line. [end]
[start] Yep, still just allegations of a crime. It is not the officers duty to decide guilt or inflict punishment. [end]
[start] Fuhk yew copo [end]
[start] That asshole cop was showboating for the cameras with his hand in his pocket. [end]
[start] Literally no one wants to hear anything from cops rn. Stop trying to play image control. Every cop thinks their station is “well ran” also when in reality all police forces have the same type of mentality in the US. [end]
[start] It's nothing to fuss about.Its seen on both sides of the law.You expect to see such sadistic humans breaking the law but you also expect them not to be enforcing the law.As their are good humans who happens to be  criminals their are vile trash who happens to be police officers as well.It ain't a matter of law but the persons morality and values. [end]
[start] Isn't what he was accused of only a crime if he knowingly tried to pass a counterfeit bill? Just because someone uses/ has one, doesn't mean they are committing a crime.  There has to be criminal intent behind the usage. [end]
[start] Yeah, officer's aren't "judge, jury, and executioner", this completely defeats the purpose of the legal system which is anarchic. [end]
[start] How blind we are.  Violence and murder has become corporatized and reserved only for the people who are granted immunity from what is considered an illegal crime to us lowly servants to the empire.  The police. [end]
[start] what do you think of that officer and the department he works for. more particularly how do you feel with them being the face of police in America? what do you and your colleagues think when you see the amount of hate, fear and revulsion your profession is gathering now....all because of the actions of those individuals and their respective departments.  you say you work for one of the good departments....have you worked for some not so good ones? how did that work out? [end]
[start] But would you have stopped him, and arrested him on the spot for murder? That's literally your job. I want to know if you would have. [end]
[start] Yo bro, it wasn't forgery. It was a counterfeit 20$, which there's a chance, didn't know he had, like most of us wouldn't, as by him not leaving the scene but was found sitting in his car parked right outside on the corner.  So this whole lynching was jumped off by a bogus arrest.  Said iy before and I'll say it again... looked more like the slave patrol was out rounding up negroes that evening [end]
[start] You know, I completely ignore what people (and institutions) say and evaluate them only on their actions.  You may be a part of a "well run department" but you gotta see how we all think that sounds laughable and completely full of shit given history and current events [end]
[start] Thank you for acknowledging it as police brutality, it’s disgusting that people would even think to make excuses for the officers actions. If you see your fellow officers displaying racist or corrupt characteristics, please do not let that slide. If you say you work in a well-run department make sure it stays that way. [end]
[start] What really set me off was the fact that the PO had his hands in his pockets [end]
[start] >I work for a really well-run department, and we would not put up with an officer like that.  sounds like someone is getting kicked out of the union [end]
[start] It doesn't help the situation when the media start to dig into the past of the victim to try to somehow justify what happened and it doesn't help either when these officers higher ups defend their actions, even though they have been fired or placed on leave.   &#x200B;  It certainly doesn't help when they are finally arrested, charged and then found not guilty. [end]
[start] ACAB [end]
[start] I mean yea, I agree with you and all but:  1. There were 3 other police officers present at the scene. None of them stepped in even when other people were begging them too.  2.  This police officer had already been involved in at least 3 shootings.  While the shootings to "appear" to be justified, that's a lot of deadly force to be using against citizens.   3.  This police officer had a number of complaints (10) against him previously.  After seeing the video and the photos of this incident, its kind of hard for me to believe he was completely innocent in all those complaints.  In short, you guys have got to do a better job of policing yourselves.  Police rely on brute force against citizens FAR too often.  Its crazy how many times police escalate a situation vs. resolving issues in a peaceful, nonthreatening way.  Violence should always be a LAST resort for police.  In almost every situation you are the better trained person, better armed, better protected, usually the most sober and have backup on the way.  There is no reason to have to touch most people you come in contact with, much less cuff them and certainly not throw or wrestle them to the ground.  It happens far too often. [end]
[start] Good. Now go tell your superiors and everyone in your fuckin department and actually do something instead of putting in minimal effort to make a reddit post and then patting yourself on the fucking back for being "one of the good ones". Fuck off with this fake bullshit. [end]
[start] Cool OP, but telling us is only stroking your ego, and phishing for justification for doing nothing about it.   Make a statement right now to your local news, with the precinct you work in, behind you. Show America, the media, the world, that all of America is not represented by these events. [end]
[start] Were there witnesses? (Apologies I can’t watch or read it it’s too distressing for me). Wasn’t someone filming? I don’t understand why they didn’t throw themselves at the police office to save George? There is no way I would stand by. I know that cos I step in whenever I see shit. I am a short woman. I guess I have a veil of feeling safe because of that? Why didn’t someone do that? I’m just so confused. And not American so not trying to judge only understand. [end]
[start] Dumbest comment ever and you realize after this what the actual problem is ! Police Vs Society  They aren’t here to protect anyone but themselves ! [end]
[start] As a police officer how many of the bad cops that you worked with are still on the force? [end]
[start] Don't be a cop if you actually care. Your entire job is to enforce racist laws and the will of the elite. How many lives have you ruined over a gram of weed? [end]
[start] Police officers have too much power and not enough training. When one fails this badly it reflects badly on all of you. Do better. ACAB [end]
[start] FTP, Go out and protest your comment in the streets if you really believe that shit. [end]
[start] ACAB [end]
[start] Stop jerking off on reddit about how you’re a good cop and join the protests then.  Do something. [end]
[start] If counterfeiting is a crime, I would like to report a serious and compulsory offender. I have posted the address info below for ease of access:   Federal Reserve System  2001 C St. NW,   Washington, D.C. 20001  &#x200B;  God speed in ridding our society of such corrupt and dangerous criminals. [end]
[start] Acab [end]
[start] Need more cops like you sir. [end]
[start] May I ask what state your department is in and if it's in a larger well known city?  I've noticed that cops are more reasonable in smaller towns, and sometimes more reasonable up North. Obviously there's something in the water in MN, but here in Florida you can almost expect the cops to shoot you for something simple. [end]
[start] Well obviously. [end]
[start] 10 FUCKING DOLLARS! [end]
[start] You take his name, write down his license plate, and do an investigation. [end]
[start] Can you guys just collectively get together and take out all the "bad apples"?  If there's just a few of them couldn't you all refuse to work with them at the same time  in protest , or make their lives so miserable that they'll quit?  I'm surprised the PBA hasn't tried to conduct a protest to scrub Departments nationally of officers like this given the huge liability in cash and community relations that are being endured by these types of situations. [end]
[start] Do you have any insight on why the "arresting" officers were switched out and why the one killing George isn't originally on the scene?   Alot of people are saying this is a cop. https://youtu.be/qv-O4rnUToU  Do you have any insight on his demeanor or the equipment he is using? The mask in particular is in question as people are under the impression that it is special issue.   Thank you [end]
[start] no shit [end]
[start] I have an honest question: why are police in the US called 12? is that their radio code o something a urban call? like when people say “12” what does 12 mean? [end]
[start] This is a good first step. Consider doing the right thing, organize and use your voice publicly to help create a positive change in this world. [end]
[start] How long would it take your really well-run department to charge their officer with murder? [end]
[start] the 10% ruin it for the 90% [end]
[start] I appreciate your thoughts here. But I wonder if you, and your fellow officers that feel likewise have shared something similar in a public forum, without the anonymity that Reddit provides. One of my best friends is a police officer, one of "the good ones", but even he has stayed silent on social media regarding George Floyd's murder. I know there are good police, but they are currently far too quiet. [end]
[start] Even if the person was being arrested for a more serious crime, killing them after they submitted to arrest is a blatant disregard for their constitutional right to a trial.  Not only is it murder, but it’s a murder that violates a constitutional right.  Let’s see all those “defenders of the constitution” mental gymnastics as to why he shouldn’t have “resisted arrest” [end]
[start] Do you think there’s a culture in many departments where officers do not feel safe or able to speak out against lesser events that perhaps lead to events like this? I have no experience in this area, so I’m genuinely asking. [end]
[start] Guess what? Even in Southeast Asian societies they looked down on black people like some sex-crazed, incorrigible damned people that cannot be saved because their circumstances circled this violent and vicious cycle. As if putting one black man down is one less sexual predator in the streets.  Source: my family. [end]
[start] Thank you for saying this. I work in law enforcement (admin) in a very well-run dept. We had two very serious officer-involved scenarios within the last month. Both incidents ended with everyone alive, thanks in part to the very excellent standards, training and accountability. As an African American (woman), this job has taught me the difference between police brutality and effective law enforcement. I'm proud. [end]
[start] Thank you. It's needed in this time to know that there is support from officers like you and police departments all over the country who are speaking out about this. Hopefully, this can start the healing in the nation. I know we have a way to go but this is a start. [end]
[start] OP, as a police offer, I want to know why the other cops  did nothing to stop it? is it normal for other cops to just keep hush? [end]
[start] You're right, it's murder. Those four men are disgusting excuses for human beings. [end]
[start] ACAB   NEVER FORGET THAT [end]
[start] How are minorities like myself supposed to trust the people we call for help if this keeps happening? 😔 [end]
[start] Are those murder cops allready arrested? [end]
[start] I'm not wanting to argue about anything - just as appalled at this tragic killing, but according to the ME, he did not die of asphyxiation.  FROM THE COMPLAINT (the charging document):  The Hennepin County Medical Examiner (ME) conducted Mr. Floyd’s autopsy on May 26, 2020. The full report of the ME is pending but the ME has made the following preliminary findings. The autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation. Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.   The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive. Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous.    Defendant is in custody on charges of 3rd degree murder, 2nd degree manslaughter. [end]
[start] Definitely second degree murder on the surface.   Maybe even first but that needs a deeper investigation.  But this should definitely NOT be classed as a third degree murder. I cannot think of any way to justify branding this as an accident. [end]
[start] I hope justice is finally served. Seems like it never is when excessive force/police brutality is involved and it's so disheartening and disgusting [end]
[start] Though it’s inevitable all cops / forces aren’t racist and unfair, it’s nice to hear stuff like this. My heart absolutely breaks for society - how is racism still a thing in 2020? I cannot fathom it - hatred and murder because of someone’s skin colour? I’m always one for a fair trial etc but I would love to see the officer that killed George executed. I wouldn’t blame black people for retaliating in any way now - riots, murder, etc. Though I don’t believe it’s the way, it’s getting to the point where anything done in retaliation is understandable at this point. [end]
[start] I heard he for charged with murder? I hope that true. And yeah so true, it doesn't matter what the crime is that is not how you handle it. [end]
[start] @whatsrightwhatslegal I want to applaud you on your comments. This is a time where everyone is divided, choosing a side and comments like that help reassure the public that the police are responsible people. Keep fighting the good fight!!! [end]
[start] you should resign in protest [end]
[start] He was charged with third degree murder. In my non-professional opinion, what I saw was first degree murder with a side order of depraved indifference.  I didn't read the whole article, but apparently they knew each other from being security at the same place. [end]
[start] Sounds like shitty police culture that enables extreme behaviour from the police. [end]
[start] Premeditated intent to kill can occur in an instant. If the cop had his knee on the guy's neck, thought about letting him up, but then thought, "Aw fuck it" and decided to keep his knee where it was, that is first degree murder.  This is from a former county sheriff, state cabinet member, and lawyer, all in the person of a woman of color who now is a radio guest often enough for me to know that she knows her shit cold. [end]
[start] Officers that demonstrate any behaviors that would lead to this unjustified death cause prejudices against good officers. [end]
[start] Thanks for responding to my previous comment.   Do you have any insight on the video footage of the ambulance that picked up Floyd?  It appears to show police coming out of an ambulance to retrieve mr. Floyd.   Do you know why there would be no life saving measures given or why there were no other emergency personnel besides police? [end]
[start] Fuck 12 [end]
[start] I agree. The worst part of it all is that if it wasn’t filmed I 100% believe nothing would’ve been done and his death would’ve just been swept under the rug like many others [end]
[start] All cops are bastards. Yes that means you. Don't just come out and type this one off BS that probably took you 30 seconds to type just to morally license yourself to continue your racist profession. Fuck off, nobody wants the polices input on this [end]
[start] So tell me, Mr. GOOD COP... what is it about your job that attracts and defends people who are capable of committing murders like this without remorse? Sounds to me like there's a psychological profile for a person wanting to be a police officer that is inconsistent with the nature of the job. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Quit your job and start protesting.   This post is just empty bullshit otherwise. [end]
[start] We should be seeing mass protests all over the country from all those "good cops" every time anyone is murdered like this. Even mass murderers get treated better than this especially if they're cute young white boys who "have their whole lives ahead of them don't ruin it".  Not saying all cops are bad but quite a few of them are for letting their bigoted, unethical, violent colleagues go about their business because of "brotherhood" and not wanting to screw up their own careers by ratting each other out. If the vast majority are good they should be cracking down and harshly treating those bad cops. They have so much power and responsibility. They can kill people and get away with it, some will seek out the job because they want that power. They should be held responsible. [end]
[start] I have a question for a police officer that I would like to know is true. Is it true that under training police officers are taught that if someone says “I can’t breathe” that by speaking it means they can breathe and they should ignore it?    If so then it’s not just the officers that are trash, it’s the system confirmed. People say “I can’t breathe” because they are having trouble breathing. Everyone knows if all air supply is cut off you can’t speak but no one is going to say “I’m having trouble getting the correct amount of air”. If you are being kneeled on, you’d say “I can’t breathe”. [end]
[start] So? Do you want a cookie? Do more, pig. [end]
[start] HEY MR POLICE OFFICER. FUCK YOU. FUCK AL OF YOU. THERE ARE ZERO GOOD COPS. FUCK OFF. [end]
[start] The only good cops are the ones that quit and find a better calling. Downvote me if you must. I grew up wanting to be a police officer.  I spent seven years in the police explorers program. When I heard an officer at the station say “Don’t worry, he’s just a N word, if you’d killed him no one would care.” I was done. I quit right there. This was in 1995. Nothings changed. Police are MURDERING black folk because they’re black folk. Think about that. The police force in the United States is a fucking lynch mob. It is not possible to be a “good” cop bc you’d eventually encounter racism,sexism,homophobia and every other phobia on the job and I’d like all the “good” cops to tell me they squash that shit as soon as it happens. They don’t squash it bc they’d be singled out, harassed, demoted, fired, etc so no, there’s no good cops...except the ones that quit. So fucking tired of hearing but but not all cops. YES ALL COPS. It’s a gang, y’all. They protect their own, lie for them, cover up for them.  If you’re a “good “cop, then I expect you’ll quit and join forces with the citizens you pledged to “protect” to end police MURDER. You can all downvote me but I’m actually right about this.  Justice for George, May those cops have a wonderful time in prison, I hear cops do really well inside. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] From the U.K - thank you for saying this. It’s heartening to know that there are still police officers out there who believe in ‘protect and serve’. [end]
[start] Thank you for this. In all seriousness.  Thank you. [end]
[start] Thank you for telling it as it is!  We need more like you on the streets. [end]
[start] Do something honourable: quit your job.  Working with the organisations that perpetrate these crimes *and* protect the criminals makes you an accomplice.  Just like a drug dealer in New York selling crack from Mexico is an accomplice to the murdering the Cartels do.  If you stay a cop, you're an enabler of the murdering cops. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Thanks for your perspective.  I wish more officers would speak out about the conduct of other officers that abuse their power. Thanks for being honest. [end]
[start] There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd, but if he had been a white man nobody would have given a thought about what happened to him.  There are people who sit on the sidelines biding their time waiting for anything like this to happen. Their purpose isn't to protest the event but to cause as much trouble and destroy as much property as possible. If one of them were stopped in the middle of looting or burning a building and asked who George Floyd was, odds are that they wouldn't have the slightest idea. [end]
[TITLE] Corona lost me all my work that I was grinding for years for. I’ve picked myself up, gotten a night job at a supermarket doing 12 hour shifts and damn it I’m proud of myself for not letting this whole thing overwhelm me! [TITLE]
[start] That is definitely something to be proud of!! It’s not always about what you do, but how you do it. Congratulations friend! [end]
[start] Yo guy/gal - anyone willing to go out and get a night shift job to keep making progress in life has nothing to worry about. You're a hard worker and that's more than lots of people can say. Keep living a life to be proud of. [end]
[start] What were you doing before?  What did you lose?    Congrats on the job, but be fucking careful. [end]
[start] this shit is going to get dark. its starting to look like we are heading into another depression type era in history. but it doesn't have to be all bad. once we get over this things are going to be a lot better than what they were before. it might take a long long time to get this all sorted out but when it does things are going to be better. [end]
[start] Sleeping and eating on a schedule will be your best friends. Been doing this for years. Some people adjust but it can still be tough, especially now. Good luck and thank you. [end]
[start] I’m in the exact same situation. Started my first shift at the grocery store yesterday. Honestly, great people and was funner than I thought. People were treating us like war vets. [end]
[start] Thank you for putting yourself out there! [end]
[start] Those are long hard hours at an awkward time of day, respect man. [end]
[start] Good for you!! That's the mentality of a true warrior! Keep it up, youre bound to achieve whatever you want with an Outlook like that. :) [end]
[start] You're a frickin AAANIMAAAAALLL!!! [end]
[start] I've been here a while. People saying reddit is bad or not welcoming forget one thing: you get what you give.  Downvote the negative mentality, upvote the positive ones. That's really what reddit is to me, though it may not be part of the reddiquette.  You are amazing, and an inspiration. Upvote the positive people! [end]
[start] I’m proud of you too. [end]
[start] I am proud of you too! It’s not about losing the work you did have it’s that life gave you a shit hand and you flipped it the bird and said “you can’t keep me down” that’s what it’s all about dude! [end]
[start] That's resilience, my friend! [end]
[start] THANK YOU!!!! A for being their for your community!  Awesome job! [end]
[start] I respect you big time. [end]
[start] Nice. All the markets around me have over 5000 applicants. [end]
[start] Proud of you! Thanks for helping out [end]
[start] That's my Plan Z if my job goes tits up.  In 2001 I was laid off from my dream job at the peak of the Dotcom bust – just 10 months after landing it. Jobs at my level in that industry were gone for years so I went back to waiting tables and started grad school for my MSBA.  In 2010 I was laid off again but I resisted "going backward" into food service or retail…and I was unemployed for nearly two years before I landed a job selling cars (which suuuuucked…but it got me working again and eventually led to my current WFH dream sales job). Lesson: Getting a job—almost any job—ASAP is better than waiting for something like what you were doing before.  tl;dr – if I get laid off I'll be speaking with the GMs at all my local Trader Joes stores the same day. [end]
[start] I wish I could give you a hug or pat on the back. Good for you! It's hard to stay positive when things work against you.  You got resilience in spades [end]
[start] So cool! You've used the catalyst for change in a positive way! [end]
[start] Probably the first post I’ve seen of someone not letting the situation get the best of them, and instead making the best of the situation. Your resilience is inspiring!!! [end]
[start] Great job man! I’m not too good with sudden change so if I was in your position I more than likely wouldn’t handle it nearly as well as you have. I hope things go well for you and you have the chance to find your footing back at your dream job 🙏 [end]
[start] I keep hearing negative comments about how corona is ruining people's business, potentially leaving people homeless, etc. But I think a lot of those people aren't looking at the bigger picture.   COVID-19 is an act of God. It's not here to be fair to us. It could be so much worse than it is. Some people aren't just losing their livelihoods over this, some people are losing their lives. We should be happy that most of us will still be around to repair the damage after this is done. This could have been just as likely to be a virus that killed 50% of infected. Instead, we got one that kills between 0.5 and 4%. We lucked out in that regard.  Corona has fucked up my life in a lot of ways, but I'm going to persevere. I'm probably going to be one of the lucky many who survive. That's a gift as far as I'm concerned. [end]
[start] You don't lose it's in you. Let's get through this motherfucker!!! [end]
[start] Thank you. I appreciate what you are doing. [end]
[start] you beautiful soul are an amazing example! thankyou for sharing [end]
[start] Thanks man! I appreciate your efforts and attitude towards the situation! [end]
[start] I love that spirit. Isn't that what life is all about? Keep rockin'. [end]
[start] Yes! Go you..... [end]
[start] I work retail and we're hiring so many ppl rn, and the thought of some of these people being those who had to quit their current passion, career, or dreams because of the virus crossed my mind just yesterday. And here you are, I am really proud of you and mad respects to you. Hopefully this virus dies down soon so everyone can resume their life again! [end]
[start] What a coincidence, I'm very proud of you too, OP :) [end]
[start] I'm proud of you too man. [end]
[start] Congrats and good outlook! Personally if I wasn't able to work from home I think I'd prefer a night job. Less people to interact with I'd assume. [end]
[start] Congrats on your unbreakable spirit and unwavering tenacity!!! Nothing but massive admiration from my end! You're the kind of person who would make a great manager/boss, because of your personality/attitude. [end]
[start] So so proud of you! At the end of all this, share your old work (or maybe now if your allowed!) I’d love to be apart of making your “lost” work a reality again! This post really uplifted my spirit ❤️ [end]
[start] Good for you bruh, rn I'm in the psych ward after an attempt. Glad to know some of us are strong enough! [end]
[start] People will always need food. [end]
[start] Wow, you should be really proud of yourself for the way you’ve rolled with the punches. You could have just sat around and felt sorry for yourself and made excuses, but you took action and refused to go under. Reminds me of this quote I saw yesterday that said, “The difference between an ordinary man and a warrior is that a warrior takes everything as a challenge, while the ordinary man sees everything as a blessing or curse.” -Carlos Castaneda [end]
[start] That's impressive\~! Kudos for the fast response and readjustment. [end]
[start] Thanks so much everyone! [end]
[start] My job counted as essential, and a second job I just got hired for is retail and also essential, so I'll be grinding through this and hopefully dodging the economic fallout. [end]
[start] Congrats man very humble! ✊🏼 [end]
[start] Good for you! Super proud of you and I hope your new job goes well! [end]
[start] Fuck yes! [end]
[start] Good work, man :)  I'm pretty much in the same boat. I was in management training after working up the ranks for years and then out of work in a day. Supermarket overnights it is! [end]
[start] As someone who just got out of an interview for a nighttime gig at a supermarket... HELLS YES 👊 [end]
[start] You did it before. You'll do it again. You also now know you have what it takes to fucking survive. Play on playa, in all meanings. [end]
[start] Shit, I’m proud of you too! [end]
[start] I thank you for doing a retail grocery gig (I do too, and know how important it is to so many others). But I sure hope to hear your music online or on the airwaves soon. Much love to you for your attitude! [end]
[start] Reddit is awesome [end]
[start] You go. We are going to come out of this and people like you will take off. Hard work and good attitude will get 90% of the way through life. [end]
[start] You guys are really good.  Congrats on picking up the pieces.  Adversity gives life a whole new perspective. You are going to come even back stronger [end]
[start] I'm proud of you for not falling victim to unfortunate circumstances! Please be safe 😊 [end]
[start] Much respect. Not easy to stay motivated for me. But I feel you. Appreciate your drive. And wish you well. Stay strong. Stay healthy. [end]
[start] It’s a setback, nothing more. You’ve got this. Thank you for keeping people fed. Stay safe! [end]
[start] Glad to hear that you found something out there! I am trying to scramble and get something done myself. It's a rough time for me, but I have to possible outcomes. 1.) I have three jobs waiting for me when Quarantine is lifted so I have to choose which one I want to work with. ( Also I don't know how long quarantine is going to last) 2.)  I am applying for more jobs online that I can do from home which I am waiting to hear back from to start more work.   I applied for unemployment and getting my first check from them soon, which is odd. I have always worked hard for what I need. And I just applied to an Aldi as a Manager Trainee which I would love to take, it's local near me. I hate the wait, and at the same time I need to stay busy I don't like/dig this situation I am in.   &#x200B;  Power to you for getting that going so quick! I hope that my situation can follow and get me back to the work force! I got goals to achieve right now. [end]
[start] That is the way to keep up the spirit. Kudos to you. I am sure everything will get better. 😀 [end]
[start] i’m so happy that you managed to stay on top of this dude. literally makes my day to see you fighting back instead of giving up❤️❤️❤️❤️ [end]
[start] You're a fucking champion. This post made me cry for like the 3rd time tonight goddamnit. [end]
[TITLE] I'm fucking addicted to dark mode. I want all my devices, every screen, every app dark. Fuck light, forever. [TITLE]
[start] YES. [end]
[start] *yesssss*  Light mode hurts my eyes, even during the day. [end]
[start] Preach! [end]
[start] Feel this. But I feel wrong for being addicted to dark mode. Like.. I know everything was made to be in light mode, so I feel I’m doing something wrong. [end]
[start] I feel you. I was so happy when I could turn IG into dark mode too. [end]
[start] Only a Sith deals in absolutes... [end]
[start] My phones been on dark mode ever since I updated it. I can’t even remember what it looks like when it’s not in dark mode [end]
[start] Same. It's so refined. [end]
[start] Correct. [end]
[start] If you're on Firefox, the Stylus addon lets you download dark themes for various websites. I can browse Facebook and Github in dark mode now. [end]
[start] My android is just black, my Linux pc has dark wallpaper and black toolbar and on the windows pc it's all dark as well. Youtube and most everything I can use in dark mode I do. [end]
[start] My bf makes fun of me for having all my apps black. I say it’s just because my phone is goth. But of course I also tell him it is better for your eyes, but he doesn’t want to switch it for some reason. [end]
[start] Felt this. [end]
[start] this post inspired me to figure out how to dark mode my reddit app finally [end]
[start] It's ok, you do you. [end]
[start] Then you are lost!  Anikin!  You were the chosen one! [end]
[start] Welcome to the Dark Side. [end]
[start] Find me in controversial [end]
[start] I really like both, if you have any apple products; they have an auto change feature; based on the sunrise and sunset, which is pretty cool [end]
[start] Does anyone else see spots/tracers when going in dark mode? I love how it looks but it fucks with my vision bad! [end]
[start] I um  I think I'll be out then [end]
[start] SAME! First reddit now my iphone! I have horrible vision and I am squinting CONSTANTLY and dark mode fucking helps a shit ton! My husband always asks why my background on my phone is so low BECAUSE I CANT SEE!!   Welcome to the dark side! [end]
[start] me too [end]
[start] I have to use dark mode because light mode actually hurts my eyes even during the day. [end]
[start] Lol a coworker of mine is going through this phase too. He installed a Chrome extension to make all pages dark a few days ago, I find it funny because it's giving him more trouble than peace. He's a front end developer so he enables and disables the extension every 5 minutes to check what the app looks like in actuality. [end]
[start] I used to have everything on dark mode but the LCD is going on my phone and the dark mode makes it freak out, flashing bright and look like it will blow up. I had to change back to light mode, screen is still a bit dodgy but dark mode just escalated the problem a lot faster [end]
[start] I turned my pixel to battery saver, now everything is dark mode [end]
[start] hahahah i love this, light mode can suck my.... [end]
[start] If u are on ios , option smart invert is avalaible in setting . Since my iphone 6 doesn’t get ios 13 update and can’t get instagram dark mode , I use smart invert option . This applies to everything except photos/media . It works on doc too iirc [end]
[start] I'm fucking addicted to penises. [end]
[start] It's our eyes, trust me nothing out of the ordinary. I've had this for years even my entire home is low lighting and my family hates it but my eyes hate light like literally I used to work night shift because I hated being out in the day too much. But all of my devices must be dark mode to the darkest, themes and all [end]
[start] Thank you. [end]
[start] YYYYAAAAAASSSSSS [end]
[start] Same dude. [end]
[start] Hell yes. [end]
[start] yup. [end]
[start] I keep it that way too. [end]
[start] PREACH LAD, PREACH FOR US!!! [end]
[start] Hollllla! [end]
[start] Have you heard of the “dark sucker theory”? [end]
[start] I’m the exact opposite... [end]
[start] Now you're talkin [end]
[start] Same! [end]
[start] dark mode matches my soul. [end]
[start] Ditto [end]
[start] I’ll never understand the obsession with dark mode [end]
[start] When will they release a dank mode though? [end]
[start] Join the dark side, we have cookies. [end]
[start] I just got Android Pie on my ASUS ROG and it's got a system wide dark mode and it's so awesome. [end]
[start] Same I use the twilight app by 7pm (8 during the summer/fall) and my computer is constantly on a dark screen. Anything brighter just destroys my eyes [end]
[start] What is this all about? Drugs? [end]
[start] I was terribly upset when IOS 7 came out. Flat and white and I hated it so much I no longer liked my phone.  I just couldn’t understand WHY And dear god, so many bugs back then.   It’s been five years and there’s finally a dark mode. And iOS is stable. I’ve regained my trust in Apple because they came up with workable solutions to things people complained about. [end]
[start] Once you go black you never come back [end]
[start] \*maximizes command line window\*   Well, it's a start. [end]
[start] Agreed. [end]
[start] Agreed, if everything on my phone could be dark mode it would be [end]
[start] You should also look into [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/news/pages/v4/welcome/) on PC. It will tone down blue light from your monitor and makes screens much more manageable for extended periods of time. [end]
[start] I’m going into dark mode now [end]
[start] Welcome to the dark side. [end]
[start] I do it as well.  Quite honestly, I'm not sure why because during bright days it can be a bit of struggle to read what's on the screen but god forbid I leave dark mode [end]
[start] It makes sense to use the eye straining light as little as possible. We are just adapting faster than the rest of the world. [end]
[start] So much better than light mode! Sleek af 😏 [end]
[start] Easier to keep focused on the content you're interested in, reduces headache triggers, and looks metal. What's not to love? I recently discovered a search engine I use has it, too. My YT, Reddit, search, bookmark page, and streaming sites are all in DM. [end]
[start] One of us one of us [end]
[start] Uh yeah, obviously. Every program should be dark mode by default. [end]
[start] If you saw a red door, would you want it painted black? [end]
[start] forever waiting for snapchat dark mode 🥺 [end]
[start] Blackened is the end!   Night mode ftw [end]
[start] Linus Tech Tips made a video on Dark Mode [end]
[start] Fuck screen light is good. Fuck all light is ... lonely. [end]
[start] Just give your eyes to a blind person. You can have what you want and give someone else what he wants.     *PUT THE EYES IN THE FUCKIN BAG* [end]
[start] Omg yes I love dark mode. But there is one app that has dark mode that just fucking hurts on the eyes, because it's pure black. Fuck, the contrast is awful. Give me some dark grey like on discord dark mode. [end]
[start] The dark is strong in this one. [end]
[start] I have everything in dark mode that has dark mode. I think Facebook is the only one. Even fucking Messenger has it. I got a dark theme on Chrome and even in windows. I hate white or bright webpages. [end]
[start] Agreed. Everything dark [end]
[start] Move to Sweden then.. [end]
[start] It's more pleasant to the eye. [end]
[start] Good. Me too. [end]
[start] ME TOOOO! Literary dark mode everything! [end]
[start] Correct. [end]
[start] Fuck light forever.  Watchin the old broke and cant make me lose control. I hold on to the flesh, the warmth and the shape, always, right?  I know that it isn't enough.  I hold on, I have to hold on, you're here, you're close to me.  I know that, when I reach for you, you've gone.  I can't forget.  Can't let myself think that it will never happen again, but I know it's the only thing I can do. [end]
[start] Same. [end]
[start] Everything I have is in dark mode. I have joined the dark side. Sorry a little bit of a Star Wars nerd here [end]
[start] When I use reddit at work I tend to use the regular white mode because it is less of a difference to the other programs that are running on the pc. [end]
[start] Join the dark side. [end]
[start] Do you wish sun has dark mode too? [end]
[start] Amen [end]
[start] I also am a fan of dark mode. I find it easier on my eyes (especially as a data analyst who stares at a computer screen for more than 8 hours a day, every day) [end]
[start] *Hisses is a dark corner* [end]
[start] agree!! everything bright hurts my eyes now ;-; [end]
[start] If you use discord, there is a way to make the app even darker than dark mode: amoled mode. Just tap a bunch on the "dark mode" option in settings and the amoled option will unhide [end]
[start] Except Instagram. [end]
[start] You know what they say... “Once you go black... “ [end]
[start] Amen!  Being someone who is visually impaired and sensitive to certain amounts of light exposure, dark mode is so much easier on the eyes.  It’s easier for me to see white on black instead of black on white so I have windows, ipad, phone, TVs everything I can set to dark mode. So far FB is the only app I use so far that doesn’t have a dark mode [end]
[start] Dark mode rulz forever and ever. I wish that was a trend when I was a teen too. Lol. Love it [end]
[start] faxxx [end]
[start] They put in new lights in our break room at work and they are the equivalent of light mode and I hate my life.  We keep them off luckily.  Still they are basically giant blocks of LED.  Sucks ass. [end]
[start] Seriously, I've been so fucking annoyed ever since Samsung decided on their own to remove dark mode from their Music app  especially since I use it at night before going to bed and nothing says bedtime like an App shining in the dark like the goddamn fucking sun. [end]
[start] Light mode is better [end]
[start] I wish we get darkmode on whatsapp soon. [end]
[start] I cant use dark mode because the white text on black hurts my eyes :( [end]
[start] I just did the same thing yesterday turned my whole phone in dark mode, its so cool. Although i worry that it is related to depression or not? 😬 [end]
[start] I just joined the dark side after years in the light [end]
[start] #TeamDark 4 life. [end]
[start] I really wish dark mode was the default for everything. [end]
[start] Fucking sammee!!! [end]
[start] I'm sick the opposite!! I put my phone on dark mode because it's better for my eyes, but I don't enjoy it. I also miss my iPhone after switching to Android. I didn't like dark on iPhone though either. Ugh. I care be so shit at change. [end]
[start] I even put my job on dark mode   [nightshifts]  (: [end]
[start] Me too! Darkness makes me happy. [end]
[start] Chill out, Anakin [end]
[start] Let me roughly explain some level of my addiction.  Basically, when you adjust brightness on your laptop, you use scale out of 10 or something similar. But some (at lease all of those I've seen!) brightness controllers internally use another scale, like, thousand or even more (my current is 5000-ish). So, when you see your brightness level 5/10, internally it's something like 500/1000. If you're geek-ish enough, and use correct operating system (I found such opportunity only on Linux, but who knows...), you're able to adjust brightness using internal controller scaling. You got what I mean? Yes, right, sometimes I use brightness 1/1000. Or, correctly, darkness 1/1000.  Though, it's almost unusable. If you're in light-isolated environment without windows, holes and whatever could be source of light - you can use such brightness. But at least something, at least traffic lights outside the window in midnight make your screen unreadable. So, usually at night I use 30/1000, it's still dark as fuck, but totally readable. [end]
[start] *Hello, darkness my old friend...* [end]
[start] *hisses* the lightly, it burns.   Yeah, me too. [end]
[start] My migraines have gone down significantly. Thank you, dark mode [end]
[start] Yes [end]
[start] Tell it to what’s app. They didn’t make it till now [end]
[start] Yup [end]
[start] :( [end]
[start] I get that, I really do, especially in the dev circles the preference for dark theme is almost a rule.  Personally, I love dark mode if I'm working in the evening, but light mode otherwise during the day. My light theme is so invigorating, motivates me to write good code.  But again, I totally get the dark mode appeal ;) [end]
[start] FACTS [end]
[start] I am addicted to light mode. I get shivers when I accidentally have dark mode on an app [end]
[start] So.... I we know the color of your soul now... [end]
[start] Join the Dark Side, yet you are. [end]
[start] Relatable [end]
[start] I like hehe lol haha [end]
[start] I am also a fan of having all my devices on dark mode! [end]
[start] Agreed....I was just thinking the same thing. [end]
[start] But there is fuck ghis im tired [end]
[start] the only thing that should ever be in light mode is “print preview” and it should give enough notice for the average person to put on their sunglasses in time [end]
[start]  The darkers are pleased to hear from you great lord; long live the master of darkness who brings wreck and suffer to the non believers of the true. [end]
[start] I agree. I darked out my i3 window manager in Linux years ago. My emacs & term are white (and syntax highlighting) on black. The raster burn on my eyes isn't so bad since I switched. [end]
[start] Hi [end]
[start] 11oh8l9 [end]
[start] i agree [end]
[start] Y E S [end]
[start] Not only is this much, much better it also saves battery in my OLED screen [end]
[start] When i first switched to dark mode i hated it. Now i dig it aswell [end]
[start] Me too! [end]
[start] How do I make dark mode happen for me? I want to experience the awesomeness too!! [end]
[start] As a light eyed, large pupiled person... yes. I already have my screen almost as dim as it can go and dark mode is even more soothing on my eyes. [end]
[start] This is racist [end]
[start] As someone dealing with eye strain from staring at a computer screen for 60 hours last week, I completely agree [end]
[start] Hate Dark Mode.  Feels like Web Design circa 1997 all over again. [end]
[start] Fuck dark. [end]
[start] I just went dark not sure what I'm typei y will my sweets adjust soon might need braille [end]
[TITLE] Parents, always trust your gut. SO shaken up. [TITLE]
[start] Holy shit...have you talked to the friends parents about this yet? [end]
[start] Oh my. My heart was pounding reading this I'm so glad that your baby girl is ok and safe. Good call. [end]
[start] I am so proud of this community  Edit: I am proud of the mother ofc, not the weirdo [end]
[start] ~~You did well, but you're not done protecting the kids. There are too many questions that need answers and people who need to be clear on how events went down. This person \*could\* be innocent, yes, but he could also be a creep who will do this again and be successful.~~ Edit: I think /u/cmck40913 makes important points. I do agree with OPs actions, though. Her instincts told her something was off and it's too risky to ignore something that strong. [end]
[start] Wait was this a play date she had never been to or was it one that she always goes to? [end]
[start] This entire post is why I don’t feel comfortable being around kids, by myself as a man, when there is no one else around. I think you WAAAYYY overreacted. I definitely understand why you did what you did, but if it was a random “aunty” you wouldn’t have reacted the same way. Double standards. [end]
[start] Was her friend and the friend,s family OK? [end]
[start] OMG that is terrifying!  When my kids were little I would stay the whole time during birthday parties until they were about 7 and I had gotten to know the parents.  Good job Mama. [end]
[start] You were right to turn around, I'd be humiliated if I let my kid with a stranger like some kind of moron. But Jesus Christ lady you have GOT to stop acting like you pulled your kid out Dahmer's hands, it was a fucking babysitter that the parents knew. [end]
[start] Jesus, I feel bad for guys these days. I could play dress up and watch kids that aren’t mine and no one will automatically assume I’m a pedophile. I’m glad she went back to see who was actually watching her kid and yes the kids parents should have told her an uncle was watching his niece but Jesus. I don’t think anything was actually wrong. [end]
[start] So... how exactly was your gut feeling "correct?" The parents asked the uncle to look after the kids and he literally didn't do anything wrong [end]
[start] So this is not in fact an example of your gut being right, your bad parenting prevented him from being able to introduce himself to you in the first place, you last minute decided to not actually fuck up, and you accused a guy of being a pedophile pretty much? Huh... [end]
[start] Wow, I cannot even believe the neurotisicm and sexism that underpins this entire post.   First of all - what exactly is the issue here? Really reflect on everything from start to finish and ask yourself what your 'gut feeling' was telling you because I do not understand what the problem is?  Yeah it would have been nice if the parents gave you a heads up about the uncle being there. But you dropped your 7 year old off at someone's house then sped off, so you too lacked the basics of communication in this scenario. You obviously trust this family enough to let your daughter enter their house alone so maybe you should trust their parental judgement when it comes to who they allow to look after their daughter and your own.  Why are you freaking out over the uncle suggesting dress ups? Maybe he knew that his niece was really interested in dressing up as a superhero or as Elsa so had prepared a bunch of toys so she would have something to do with her friend when she wakes up. He was probably really excited about hanging out with her cause that's how a lot of aunties and uncles feel about their nieces and nephews.   I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm attacking you because that's not what I'm trying to do here. I just find it so disappointing that we live in a society that distrusts men so much when it comes to children. Cause, let's be real... most of this wouldn't have been a drama if Aunty Jess was the one playing with your daughter.   Edit: I also want to add that you have the right to feel uncomfortable and say no to a stranger babysitting your kid. But you should have at least done a handover at the door ("Hey guys, thanks for watching her, here's her drink bottle and some snacks and I'll see you at 6") and alot of this drama could have been avoided. You and the other parents have gotta learn to trust each and/or communicate better. [end]
[start] Did you contact the family and ask about the uncle? [end]
[start] So... you didn't confirm there was a problem, and you later confirmed that there wasn't a problem.   Why exactly should you trust your gut? [end]
[start] Let's embarrass some probably-kind hearted uncle watching the kids for the day because you're paranoid and sexist af. Cool [end]
[start] God I was watching my sisters kid when some lady showed up and dropped her kid off then got mad at me for not knowing what was going on, AITA? [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Good for you for going back even if the child was perfectly safe. If you give the people the benefit of the doubt, they do not have the same values as you do. The play date people put no consideration that the child might be scared when a stranger was there rather than the people she knew. They really didn't think of your feelings either. They might be nice people but it doesn't sound like they put kids, any kid's not just their own safety and happiness as a top priority. [end]
[start] The one piece of advice I always give new parents is - always trust your instincts [end]
[start] People in the thread telling this mom she overreacted are horrible. As a childhood sexual assault survivor often family friends are the most dangerous people to leave your kid alone with. Don’t listen to these trash comments you did the right thing. Always go with your gut as a parent and air on the side of caution. There’s no reason an adult man should be suggesting they play dress up together alone. [end]
[start] Honestly, I don't think it was "nothing", I think you averted tragedy. The not introducing himself as someone that doesn't know you or your child, the not opening the door all the way, the not mentioning anything any of the changes to the play date, the dress-up "game" with a FULL-GROWN MAN.  Nah bro, if it was like a duck...  Dad senses on point, even though you were temporarily focused on other stuff. [end]
[start] I'm really happy that your girl is okay, this post made me fuc\*\*\*\* anxious. [end]
[start] The point is about a stranger, not a family relative, playing dress up with my daughter. But you do as you please. [end]
[start] It’s so weird that the friends parents didn’t even say anything to you that the uncle would be “the one watching them”. That’s super strange [end]
[start] This is sort of a cautionary tale from my own childhood, which is somewhat related.  My parents had full trust in letting their friends watch me as a child while they went out on a date. Those friends trusted that their son could look after me for a bit while they worked in the yard. Their son was pretty sure he could trust his friend to look after me while he played a video game. And that's how I ended up being pretty viciously sexually abused at age 4. To be honest, I wouldn't trust anyone else with my child before they were 10, and I'd do my best to teach them that authority is given, not granted. Ultimately, though, my childhood is the exact reason I would rather be a eunuch than have a child. [end]
[start] I had an incident when my son was in grade 2. He went for a play date somewhere where he had been before. Dad answered we talked about the plans, I had already checked him out. All should have been good. What I didn’t know what that another child was invited over that day as well.  2 months later my son told me the other friend wanted to play naked wrestling and asked about  touching privates.  Nothing happened my son was educated on how to handle that from ADULTS but I failed to prep him for other children. That is why there was a delay in him telling.   I wrestled with whether or not to report the incident to CAS. Nothing really happened, kids stuff, I could have talked myself out of it.  But my gut said call. So I did and it turned out the child had a long history of this type of behaviour and was well known to the school and CAS. Because I made them aware of another incident he was finally able to get the help he needed.  The Dad had no clue what his son was being exposed to and felt terrible.  Always report. It’s to HELP children. [end]
[start] You're making it sounds like your gut saved your child when... your post history shows everything actually was alright and he was the uncle. So why should I trust my gut if it lies like this? [end]
[start] Woah that is crazy. Good job trusting your gut! Are you going to talk to the child’s parents at all about it? [end]
[start] That is so scary! I always think worst case scenario so I would never let my kids (even though I don’t have any yet) go somewhere unless I was very close with the parents. I don’t trust anyone ! [end]
[start] You agreed to a play date with the child, not a random uncle. I see nothing wrong with the post. [end]
[start] People who "Always trust their gut" are generally idiots, though. [end]
[start] Well I'm glad your daughter is safe. Communication is key [end]
[start] OP how are you following up with this? Have you talked to the parents? Was that really the uncle? Was the kid home? [end]
[start] My mom had all sorts of warnings including being preyed on by an uncle she would later send me on camping trips with even though I told her the things that went on, this made my heart pound but I just want to say how deeply grateful that there is a parent like you for that child. I go with my gut now and it’s prevented all sorts of bad things happening had I not listened to that familiar twist. [end]
[start] Tl;Dr  Mom of the year kicks daughter out of car and speeds off with goal of spending as little time as possible handing her child off to someone else.  Mom suddenly realizes she doesn’t know adult at handoff who she never bothered to identify (because of aforementioned goal to spend as little time in handoff as possible) and therefore adult *must* be a pedophile.  Mom speeds back and takes daughter back while presumably making wild accusations.   The friends entire story later checks out and no foul play was present.  Mom of the Year makes reddit post about how she saved her child by trusting her “gut” anyway, because it’s good karma. [end]
[start] I had a similar experience. A trusted individual was supposed to be watching my daughter for a few days. When we checked up on her everything felt wrong. My husband and I got her out immediately.    Turns out the guardian was very drunk. We cancelled a work meeting and took her straight home. The guardian got help for alcohol abuse and is now much better off.    Never, ever let fear of causing a scene or stepping on toes stop you from protecting your children. Your gut is right. Be safe out there. [end]
[start] Did you confirm later that this was actually the right address?! Glad she is safe. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] What about her friend? [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing and thanks god your daughter is ok [end]
[start] Hi [end]
[start] Youre a bad mother. Some dudes trying to help out his sister, you leave your kid with him then accuse him of being a pedo. Your kid deserves better than you. [end]
[start] Even if it's just paranoia, keeping your kids safe is priority and unknown elements popping up during a period of time pressure is red flags.  Security has no room for missing information yo. [end]
[start] Jesus Christ my heart was pounding reading that. Imagine you hadn’t turned around god that is so creepy. Have you contacted the parents to ask wtf was going on? [end]
[start] A bit dramatic af 😭 [end]
[start] Dude holy shit. It’s better to look paranoid even if it’s embarrassing especially if you have an off feeling than to just say whatever and ignore what you feel. [end]
[start] They just decided to bring in a random uncle to fill in? Fucking idiots. You at least mention this in a phone call or something. [end]
[start] Intuition. You have it for a reason. Good on you. [end]
[start] /r/LetsNotMeet  Glad you came to your senses. Good listening to your inner senses about this. [end]
[start] Yeah, agreed. She was emotional and scared. Agree with you. [end]
[start] Definitely call the family and tell them/ask them about what happened [end]
[start] I'm an uncle with a niece and a nephew.  I would never ever think of playing dress up with a child alone. That just screams weird and inappropriate.  Also, that family should of told you that someone else was going to watch them and let you decide.  All around I think you did the right thing and I would call that family. [end]
[start] Wow. I envy your pedophile detecting superpower. I wish you could raise my kids! [end]
[start] You are a good parent. All that matters is that you went back because of your parental instinct told you too. Most parents would probably be "oh its fine, im just overthinking" or That would be rude to go back and check on them" But you didn't do that, and i commend you greatly. [end]
[start] Oh wow! So glad you trusted your gut and went back for her [end]
[start] Holy sh*t!! This is terrifying!! You’re a super mom for trusting your gut and turning around. I mean, it could of been nothing, but it sounds like something. Dress-up? No other play date? Holy crap. Soooooo weird. Glad your little one is safe. [end]
[start] the hair on the back of your neck has no brain to talk it out of truly sensing danger...trust it. pit of stomach too. [end]
[start] This has me almost shaking [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] omg is there anyway you could report this guy?!?! [end]
[start] I would like to genuinely congratulate you on learning the best method of dealing with life - “fuck politeness.” Your gut is what kept you alive when you were running from predators 2000 years ago, and it tells you when there’s a predator in your face now. Good job listening to it.   You can be a cordial and pleasant person in society and still not let people mess with you. Teach both of your kids to be vocal about their safety, unfortunately in this world it’s necessary.   Turning that car around was a great move. You’re a good mom. [end]
[start] Good instincts. [end]
[start] "For having some sort of internalized bias against men watching kids" As a single father, I see a lot bias towards mothers in parenting (mostly by companies and assistance programs) and it gets me upset.  HOWEVER. As a single father, I assume the answer to somebody's child coming to my house, (other than family of course. I watch family members all the time) is no. And if a parent of my daughter's friend doesn't also assume that, I let them know that my child's mother does not live with me and therefore there will be no non-related children at the house.  I don't creep on kids or any of that shit, but it doesn't matter, still always a no.  If one of my daughter's friends has a dad who is comfortable watching the kids at the house, without his wife also home, then I have the "you guys can play at the park together, but don't go near their house and stay out of their yard" with my kid.  Y'all can hate if you want, but there's a principle engrained in me about this that's existed before I even had a kid and I'll be the downright villian before I put my child at that risk.  Ladies, if a man has a problem with you not wanting him alone with your child, he has a problem regardless, fuck what he thinks. [end]
[start] I live in a state that’s very culturally different than where I grew up. My friend who grew up here told me she never ever got to spend the night at anyone’s house when she was a kid. I always thought that was strange, because my parents let me spend the night with friends all the time. Now that I’m a parent, I get why her mom and all the moms here don’t allow sleepovers. I won’t either. Is it fair that you just kind of don’t trust people? Not really. Is it necessary? Absolutely. [end]
[start] Always go with your gut instincts! Proud of you mama bear! [end]
[start] If I'm a parent and my gut says "Shake the baby" I guess that's what I will do!  &#x200B;  Edit:  \-25? really guys I'm fuckin joking, calm down.  &#x200B;  edit edit:     Also, finally read the entire thing, yeah I read the fuckin title and that was it. Yeah, that's a bit creepy of the uncle to suggest dress up. I get watching TV or anything else, but no. That's a bit wrong. [end]
[start] Bless you. I'm sorry this happened to you and well done for turning around [end]
[start] Thank God for parents' instinct! [end]
[start] Good job mom. I'm literally crying I'm so grateful you did that for your baby [end]
[start] Oh my god !! So scary [end]
[start] Kudos to you. I always thought there is something to be said about our "gut feelings" [end]
[start] Hats off to you. [end]
[start] Holy fuck are you from USA?? [end]
[start] I feel scared for the little girl she was suppose to have a play date with...I’d be calling dcf to make a report for sure [end]
[start] I’m so glad you followed your instincts! God bless you and your family! [end]
[start] You’re instincts were spot on! Nicely done [end]
[start] That is frightening and I would definitely call the non emergency police number and talk it over with them. Maybe they need to make a visit to ensure all is well. [end]
[start] So incredible, an inspiring story. Congratulations on humaning so well.  Edit: WTF Reddit? Someone just accused me of being a child predator sympathizer because of this comment. I have children, sometimes gut feelings feel like you’re just being paranoid. So for this person to stop the routine and go back for the kid is incredible and inspirational, being  a great human is humaning so well. I don’t see how this could be misunderstood, and I’m a bad communicator, so if someone could explain how what I wrote could be interpreted as sympathizing with predators please enlighten me. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] It definitely wasn’t nothing [end]
[start] All kinds of suspect, holy moley good call [end]
[start] Everytime I ignored my gut feeling,  I've always regretted it. There might be nothing to it but then again there might. I would rather be safe than sorry. Glad your lil one is ok [end]
[start] Sick, you're a hell of a parent, nice job. Mothers instinct [end]
[start] I would still send your kid to therapy, I was sexually abused as a child by my dad's best friend and when my mom asked me if anything happened I told her nothing because I was ashamed and didn't want to talk about it. [end]
[start] As parents seems like we always have something going on.So glad you went with your gut & got your daughter before anything happened to her.You are so right there is nothing more important then your child.Thanks for sharing,keep up the good work. [end]
[start] Did you ever check in with the parents about uncle Chester the molester? [end]
[start] Notify the police. Even if nothing comes of it, they'll have a report if someone else is ever a victim of this guy. They'll have precedent and be more inclined to believe it when it inevitably happens to some other poor girl.  This isn't nothing. "Playing dress up" is literally what pedophiles do. I think it's part of the grooming process. If I had to guess it's something like making them comfortable getting undressed around them so when the time comes that they just want them naked, it'll be easier. There are some seriously disturbed people in the world. Report this.  Edit: lmfao, what could these idiots possibly be downvoting me for? For giving her good advice? Mad that I'm telling them their pedophile tactics? Fucking disgusting some of you people are. Sickening, truly. [end]
[start] Call the cops [end]
[start] This sums up one of my favorite sayings. Be weird. Be rude. Stay alive. If something inside tells you something is *wrong*, LISTEN. [end]
[start] Wow this post gave me chills. I can never leave my kid to someone's place till he is over 10 [end]
[start] Never feel like it’s awkward to go back and check in on your kids, because other parents would understand the need to know your daughter is safe.   The fact the guy took in the kid is really dodge, Id report that to the police immediately because most normal people don’t take custody of kids like that when they know not to! The whole dress up thing is really weird too! [end]
[start] A stranger wants to play dress up with your daughter alone the first time he meets her and you didn't call the cops? [end]
[start] I’m glad you turned back too. Thankful for you child to be safe. But pleas do not leave children with men to babysit them. Unless its her father or grandfather I don’t understand leaving a child with a man in this day. [end]
[start] First of all, wtf is a playdate and when did this ever become a thing? Second, why would you send your child to a stranger's house for a so called "play date"? I'm so confused right now. [end]
[start] OP you need to tell the friend's mom about this ASAP.  It's great that you followed your gut and got your daughter out but you have an obligation now to warn her friend's mom, because she clearly leaves him alone with her daughter and she's potentially a victim.    As someone who was sexually abused by family as a child, I wish an impartial adult had seen the red flags and told my parents.  My life would be drastically different. [end]
[start] So you called CPS right? [end]
[start] Great job!! I was shaking just reading....I hope you're feeling better now.  I also want to thank you for posting this story. I'm always amazed by certain comments even though I shouldn't be.  That's life...Some people will say "not all men", while some men will go out of their way to make women feel safe and comfortable when they're out and about.   Thank you for posting. Indeed trust your gut, and protect and advocate for your kids! Posts like these are of value to us parents, especially those of us who are new or young or simply less confident. [end]
[start] Good on that gut!!!!!!   ❤️ I mean it and I’m grateful you listened !!!  You should have called 911.  Note Didn’t have time to read other posters.  Don’t let the shit go!!!!  Edit:  again, haven’t read all, but also, notify mother immediately & child sex abuse authorities.  This is why these people get away with shit. We aare all so fucking eagerto protect everyone and sweep it under the rug. And pretend it doesn’t happen to 2 outa 3 girls before age 18. [end]
[TITLE] I'm 18. Just found out that I'm pregnant [TITLE]
[start] No advice, just sending much strength. Go fix this, go be an awesome nurse, and if/when you're ready, get a child born in a loving and stable family. [end]
[start] You should also check out birth control implants. They’re easier and more reliable.   Be brave. Know what you want and follow through. Never allow yourself to be made to feel guilty or otherwise bad about yourself by others.   All the best with uni! :) [end]
[start] Do what's best for you, trust your gut. There's always a way. [end]
[start] Just some info for the future, antibiotics and charcoal products decrease the efficacy of birth control pills [end]
[start] Allow yourself to feel whatever you feel afterwards. You have your reasons and it's nobody else's business - but you might feel somehow different to what you expect, and that's ok! Just allow yourself to process it and move on, don't try bury unwanted emotions or belittle yourself if your emotions don't go according to plan. Either way. Negative or positive.   A friend went through simular. Beat herself up for deciding to abort, felt nothing but relief afterwards then beat herself up about feeling relieved.   All the best x [end]
[start] You may not have taken the pill wrong. It’s not 100% effective so there’s always a chance for pregnancy even if it’s small.   Be kind to yourself. While you are thinking logically and realistically, the hormones will be crazy after the abortion. Take time to yourself and allow yourself to heal physically and emotionally. If you want your mom’s support, tell her you’re pregnant and how you’d like her to support you (going with you, emotionally, etc.). [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Since I’m a boy I can’t help you with advices but I wish you all the best and send you all my support. Whatever you decide there’s no bad choice. [end]
[start] I'm in my 50s.  In a recent conversation with my aunt who is in her late 70s she told me 3 members of our family had abortions.  One I knew about.  The other 2 were my grandmother (her mother) and my great grandmother (her grandmother.)  I am grateful that you have access to a safe medical procedure and that you have the right to choose what's right for you.  I'll be thinking about you. [end]
[start] Good luck.  You will be fine. The abortion isn’t as traumatic as you think. The staff in clinics are sensitive and kind and you will move on with your life knowing you did what was right for you.   I would get an IUD when you are done.  Mine has been amazing and you don’t have to worry about missing any doses. [end]
[start] Have an abortion and continue with your life. You are too young and you have plans.  Remember that some guys may not take the abortion solution so nicely. Some want to become Daddies and mess up with legal consequences using legal resources to stop women from having an abortion.  Good luck [end]
[start] If you can’t tell your mom please tell a friend and have them go with you or pick you up after. You are not doing anything wrong. This is YOUR life. And you deserve the best. And your future children, should you want them, also deserve the best. At 18 you cannot give them the best. Go to school, start your career, and have a family when it’s best for you.   I had one at 22. I had no remorse or regret, but pregnancy hormones are NO JOKE. You will probably be emotional, but don’t take that to mean you are doing the wrong thing. You aren’t. It will hurt, but not for super long. Take the next day off and go home and watch movies curled up in a blanket. When they say no sex for 3 weeks, believe them. If you can do the pill form of abortion, do it. I wish I had ponied up the extra money to avoid the more painful procedure.   BREATHE! This is hard but not the end of the world. You will make it through this. And don’t let anyone say you are irresponsible. You are making such a big, difficult, responsible choice right now. [end]
[start] Ultimately, your current line of thinking sounds very logical and mature for your age. You have a lot of potential if you're about to enter a pretty difficult degree to get into.   Whatever you decide to do, I'd recommend getting counselling once you make the decision. This stuff is pretty intense to go through at any age, so it's best to make sure that your mental health is running at a good level.   Best of luck. [end]
[start] My mom would NEVER be okay with an abortion (Mexican), therefore i would never tell her about my decision. I think it would hurt her more than anything. I would definitely just keep it discreet and just keep it to myself, its ok to keep things to yourself sometimes:) glad theres this sub so you can at least grt it off your chest. Good luck! [end]
[start] There are plenty of people who will tell you negative things. Let me be one person who tells you that it's probably a good idea. It's probably a good decision. You very well may look back years later and still consider this a good decision. I've been through it, it's rough, but I do not regret it and it was the best decision for myself and my girlfriend at the time and even fifteen years later I still acknowledge that it was the right decision. [end]
[start] Wait, you were sick?  Did you take antibiotics?  Because antibiotics will make the pill ineffective while you're taking them, and for a little while after also. [end]
[start] Good move. If you have doubts read about philosophy of antinatalism. Being born into family that isn't ready for kids is not fun, orphanage isn't either. [end]
[start] Not much advice but sending you all the love. Sounds like you’re making the best decision for yourself! [end]
[start] Sending love support and positivity your way. [end]
[start] Congratulations on learning to prioritize yourself at 18! That is a lesson I learned much later. Sending you strength and luck for your procedure. Be an awesome nurse, embrace your future, and enjoy your life! [end]
[start] You got this girl. Everything is going to be okay. [end]
[start] I didn't tell my mum. She didn't need to know. Good luck to you. :-) [end]
[start] Be brave but tell you’re mom. You will want her there. It will also crush her when she finds out later that her daughter had to go through something like this at such a young age alone. (No judgement I had an abortion at 18 as well and I wish I told my mom.)  I remember being so sick I was crying and calling out for her. I’m now 30 and I just told her last year that this happened when I was 18 and she looked so sad. Her expression was so sad I hope no other mother ever will have to feel how I made her feel.   You are making the right choice, I can guarantee you that. Try nuva ring! It’s super cheap and you literally put it in and forget it for a few weeks. Hello two day periods and goodbye stupid tiny pills that only work under specific rules!!!!!! [end]
[start] Big hugs. Do what is best for you. There are people that will tell you they made a different choice, and that’s ok for them. You are not them. Make your own choice. If you believe that your mom will be supportive, then tell her if you want to. Otherwise, tell someone you trust so you can have some support. I wish you all the best at university and your future career. [end]
[start] My grandmother was 18 when she found out she is pregnant with my aunt. As far as I know, she, too, didn’t know what to do. She decided to keep it and she actually was really happy with her choice. But, of course, if you feel like you aren’t ready to be a parent, then don’t. Do whatever is best for you. I’m sending you much love and strength and good luck on whatever choice you make! [end]
[start] just take care of yourself op [end]
[start] Sending you positive vibes and praying for strength. Keep your head up. [end]
[start] I’m getting way too mad reading the dumbass pro life comments on this post but based on your rational and mature responses to them you obviously have a good head on your shoulders. Good for you for doing what’s right for you ❤️ you’re extremely strong! Sending you love and support ❤️ [end]
[start] I had an abortion at 18. It was the best decision I've ever made for myself.  Sounds like you have a good support system. My boyfriend was also totally on board and went with me and helped with my aftercare. I couldn't tell my parents. You've got this. [end]
[start] I terminated a pregnancy at 18 as well. Sending you all of my love. It's hard but without making that choice I wouldnt have met my husband and had our amazing little boy and have my bun in the oven. We all have to make our choices and im proud of how strong you are to make yours. [end]
[start] I'm happy you have access to services that allow you to make mature choices for you and your body! If you hear any annoying buzzing sounds, that's the people who have no say in what you should be doing trying to tell you what to do. Just ignore them, they're pests. [end]
[start] I fell pregnant with my son when I was 17. I was also on the pill for 2 years before this. It never really crossed my mind to have an abortion and he was born a healthy baby.   I love my son. With all my heart. But I was a young mum and While I did the best I could, I really feel I didn’t do him justice. That makes me feel sad and ashamed. I have four kids now (after a 10 year break) and I can honestly say that I am a much better mother now than I was with my son. And boy do I get depressed sometimes when I think of the life experiences and opportunities I missed out on. It may feel hard, making this decision, but my advice is to go ahead with it. A child changes your life in more ways than you can truly understand until you have kids. If you know you’re not ready, then you’re absolutely doing the right thing. If you’re worried about telling family, then don’t. They don’t really need to know unless you’d like them as someone to share your feelings about everything. Also don’t let anyone guilt you about not considering adoption. That’s all very noble and all but there are hundreds of thousands kids in the foster care system already.   Love your life. LIVE your life. Bless [end]
[start] I had someone close to me in a very similar situation and also went for an abortion. She’s got a full time job now and probably never regretted her choices, and why would she?   Hope everything works out for you and your mom is supportive. [end]
[start] I was made to consider this choice in my life, and I was married and working full time at the time.  I want to encourage you to not allow any comment here influence your choice.  Your life is just beginning, and is more valuable than anything that *could* exist 9 months from now. Your body, your choice. Don't let anyone take that choice away from you.   You will get through this. [end]
[start] I'm a nurse and still had one because sometimes it's just not the right time. You did all you could to prevent it. I am currently pregnant with my pill baby - apparently IBS and GI tract problems can make pills less effective, which I learned the hard way. Good luck and good luck in your studies! [end]
[start] Hello, similar age. Currently over half way through my pregnancy. Just came to say *I support you* and please don’t let others change your mind! Do what is best for you. I have seen many people say “well it’s just a few months! It’s no big deal!” But it most certainly is. I am happily pregnant, absolutely over the moon, yet I can tell you I would **NEVER** stay pregnant if it was not wanted. Pregnancy is absolute hell and it’s not worth it if you’re not actually for it. These past almost 7 months have been extremely hard and have taken such a toll on me mentally and physically. I couldn’t imagine being able to put up with this if I didn’t actually want the baby once born.   You know yourself best and you know what is best for you. Stick to that. Screw what anyone else says. [end]
[start] You sound mature and sensible, far beyond your years. You’ll get through this. [end]
[start] Do what you feel is best for your life.  I tend to agree with your decision to terminate, if that matters at all.  It is your body, and if my teen daughter was in your position, I would tell her the same. [end]
[start] Peace to you friend. This doesn't have to be a super rough time. I hope your man treats you well along the way though.  It's a time to be thinking about what's best overall. If telling your mother is going to introduce a bunch of drama into your life, just remember that it's your body and you have zero obligation to share the info with anyone.  Also kick ass as a nurse! [end]
[start] First of all, I want to say that I'm very proud of you. I'm sure this is a lot for you right now, and some of these comments down here aren't making things any better, but it takes a lot of courage to make this decision. I mean it takes a lot of courage to go through this **period**, but, you know what I mean I hope.  Put yourself first, cause you're not living as anyone else.  Please take care of yourself and I believe in you! [end]
[start] If you are sure about an abortion act fast and insist on a chemical abortion. You have to be less than 5 weeks but it is a thousand times easier on your body and your mental health.   Years  ago I was date raped and became pregnant. I went to a doctor immediately and asked for an abortion. The doc said he’d get me a referral. After that a friend told me to go to the local sexual health clinic instead. Within a week of that I had had my chemical abortion. 2.5 months later the doctors office called me back for my referral. Where I live abortions are only legal till 12 weeks. I told them it was done and reamed them out for the delay. I told them to tell the doctor that if his morals don’t agree with abortion he should at least be honest with patients and allow them to seek a different doctor, rather than waiting until it’s almost too late to give them a referral.   On the other hand the sexual health clinic didn’t judge or delay and made an already intensely difficult situation so much easier. [end]
[start] I wish you all the best on the next few weeks. You have to do whats best for you. Feel free to reach out to r/auntienetwork if you need any help. [end]
[start] Best of luck! Please find someone to drive you home after the procedure and take a few days off of work/life to recover. [end]
[start] Yeah 100% get an abortion. You don't wanna burden yourself with a child at this age. Even though some people pull it off well there's no need to switch your life difficulty to extra hard mode. Good luck and I hope everything goes well [end]
[start] I was in the same position, a first year law student, 2 weeks of being 18, living an hour and a half away from her family, father of the baby was my ex of 7 years that was seeing a new girl.   I was super unsure, didn’t want to force him to be a dad tho, so I had an abortion.   Was so scared to tell my mum. But did and she was my biggest support through it all (actually paid for my abortion).  It’s been over 12 months now, it’s not easy let me tell you, I cried for months and sometimes I still do, but I grew from that, I wasn’t ready, I know that now.   Everything in life happens for a reason, you’re on a path that a higher power has made for you, follow it and everything will be okay.  You’ve got this.   - love a happy, strong and different 19 year old woman, who learnt she could conquer anything and that everything will be ok ❤️❤️ [end]
[start] I also found myself pregnant at the same age. Only you know what's best for you and there is nothing wrong with wanting to make something of yourself before having babies. As far as telling your mother I suggest only doing so if you know she will be supportive of your decision because the last thing you need is someone being critical of your decision. Go to school, make yourself a good life and have babies then. I didn't have an abortion that time(i had at another time) and I only wish I had done all of those things first. For my babies sake. Good luck you sound like a smart girl. [end]
[start] Good luck, OP. Take care of yourself and get plenty of rest. Don’t be too hard on yourself. [end]
[start] I'd recommend getting the procedure done ***before*** informing the father (or never tell him, your choice). Can't let anyone guilt you out of doing what you want with your body. [end]
[start] Damn, I hope everything turns out okay for you. Don't let the crazies, if any, get to you. You're doing what's right for you and your future and that's all that matters. [end]
[start] I'm a Male, 22, and also in a a nursing program.  My girlfriend ended up pregnant a few months back and together we decided that we weren't ready.  I still have 4+ years of school to complete and our living and working situations arent ideal for a child.  You know what's best for you.  If you arent ready you arent ready and I'm glad you're strong enough to realize it.  Good luck to you [end]
[start] Seems like a good decision. [end]
[start] Best of luck with it all. Your body, your choice.  I am 19 and have a Mirena IUD. Might be worth looking into it if you want to find another type of contraception.  Good luck at uni! You’ll be an awesome nurse [end]
[start] Abort. And get an implant like Nexplanon. Only 0,05% failure rate. [end]
[start] It’s just a bunch of cells and you are making the choice to not grow it into a human that will have a tough life and ruin your own. You’re making the right choice. ♥️ [end]
[start] Don’t know if you’re still reading the comments, but you’ll be okay. I’m an 18 year old girl and I would do the same thing to if I were in your shoes. If you and your mom have an okay relationship, and she’s pro-choice, Definetly tell her. Nobody will be there for you like your mom, and chances are you’ll want her support and love in this difficult time. Everything will be okay, and you’re making the right choice. [end]
[start] Plan ahead for after- load up on comfort foods & recommended comfort/healthcare items (depending on method),  and know that whatever you are feeling (or not feeling) is normal. If you've got somebody to hang out with or to check on you arrange that.  Regardless of the type of medical procedure everybody has a different reaction to pain/discomfort. Don't be a hero- keep ahead of it & prioritize your physical and emotional comfort.  I've supported many folks receiving these procedures. It's straightforward and you'll be fine. [end]
[start] I’m proud of you for the decision you’re making. I have had the procedure and it’s simple if you get it done somewhere professional. Protect yourself and keep healthy. The next few weeks will be super hard, so make sure you talk to the doc about chemical/hormonal imbalances so you can keep your head right. Eat plenty, drink plenty, and give yourself time to grieve the possibility, even though it is not the right time. You’re going to have a lot of feelings, it won’t do any good to stuff them in a box, it may do a lot of good to talk to someone for a couple sessions, a good therapist can help you set yourself in order to move forward. You’re going to keep doing great honey. Again, I’m proud of you! for knowing you can make this decision, and taking your future (and any potential little future) very seriously.  Hugs if you’d like them from an internet sis. [end]
[start] Millions of women share your experience. Don't let this define your life it's not a person it's an insensible blob of body tissue. [end]
[start] I had this exact situation whilst I was at university, I was in my first year and it was all a bit much. The only other person that knew my situation was the father and he was completely supportive. If you have that kind of relationship with you mum, where you can tell her and talk to her about things like this, then definitely tell her. You’ll need emotional support and mums are the best at that! Best advice I can give? Don’t be ashamed, there’s nothing to be ashamed about. You’re looking after you and that’s more important than anything sometimes. Good luck with everything! [end]
[start] Good luck to you. I’m sorry you’re in this position,  but you will make it through and you will be okay. Hang in there, bud. You’ve got support from me, even if from no one else. [end]
[start] Good luck! I hope you find relief ASAP! [end]
[start] Good luck and we are lucky to be in a place where this can be done safely! [end]
[start] Been exactly where you are at 18 34 years ago. Ready to go to college. Went to the library to do research before I had my abortion. Thought I only missed a few weeks but when I was just about to be put under the doc said, "Oh, you're a good 10 weeks along." It did not change my circumstances. It was not fun, but it was also not terrible. My life would have been drastically different if I had kept working fast food, had a baby, stayed in TX, stopped my education. Because I put myself first, I went to art school in CA, grew my own interests, became a whole adult and I have a home and a teenager and I am able to be a much, much wiser mom. I understand the place you are in and I wish you all the best. Take care of yourself. [end]
[start] Your same exact situation happened to me long ago. And if that option hadn’t been available to me I wouldn’t be who I am now. I wasn’t ready, too young, unprepared, and I knew my boyfriend at the time may not be someone I want to share my life with. Now I have a good job that I am advancing in. I am a home owner and I am married to the love of my life. I never got pregnant or had a baby after it happened. I told my mother. Yes she was shocked and disappointed but I understood. I was embarrassed and scared and ashamed of myself. But I was on the pill too. We even used a condom... it broke. My mother soon became very supportive and today we have a great relationship. And I believe in her heart she understands why I had to do what I did. I’m glad you are telling the guy, I did too and it helps to let people in. You are being very strong and mature about the consideration of your future. We women that have to get abortions never WANT to voluntarily go through this. But most of us being young... I have to say your life matters too. What you feel will make you happy in your decision is important too. Good luck to you. You have someone in the world that relates. ❤️ [end]
[start] I got pregnant at 18 as well.  It was my freshman year of college and I had a new bf just like you. I was terrified when I found out but knew immediately the right decision was to get an abortion.  I went to my bf and told him I was pregnant and had already made an appointment for an abortion. I payed for it myself and didn’t tell my parents or anyone else really. My advice would be to tell your mom. It sucked not having anyone to talk to about what I was going through and if I would’ve just told my mom I could’ve used my parents insurance for the procedure and saved a lot of money.   Also, don’t get too down about this! I know it sucks right now but it will all be in the past soon and you will look back knowing you made the right decision for you. [end]
[start] You should do anything in order to make it easier for you. Chosing to have an abortion is already difficult enough, so in my opinion you should tell your mom only if you know she will be by your side and help you get through this (considering you are 18). If she will freak out and get mad, it's just gonna make things worse. Wish u the best! [end]
[start] I feel for you, young friend. You're good. This is hard. My friend had an unwanted pregnancy with her partner a year and a half ago. They had been together for years but had already started to talk about breaking up when their lease ended that impending summer. They split the cost of the abortion and for her it was an uncomfortable process to put it mildly (early chemical abortion), but it was unquestionably absolutely the right thing to do, in her mind. I stand by my friend and I stand by you. I don't know your mother so I can't know how she feels about abortion, how she feels about sex, how she feels about women's rights, but I hope that if you ever do tell her, she has nothing but compassion for you. If anyone ever does shame you, please know that you've done the right thing. Nobody born into being your cold right now would get a fair shake, and you have no obligation to be a parent right now when you have a different plan for your life.  Take care! xoxo [end]
[start] Personally, I wouldn't tell the "father" until after it's gone, you don't need anyone trying to talk you out of following your heart and building your future. Be strong, stay safe. [end]
[start] I am glad you are making the right choice for you and that you are in a country that does not persecute you for this.  Consider an IUD. It's a one time thing and you don't have to think about it for years. You can get one even if you have not given birth. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Best of luck in nursing school! [end]
[start] I can’t offer much help as a 20-something guy, but I helped my little sister through this same situation not too long ago. There will likely be people outside the clinic to try and stop you. Just ignore them and keep going. Nobody has a right to stop you, and having a child at such a young age and without financial security could be very problematic. Do what’s best for you moving forward, and keep yourself happy and healthy. [end]
[start] 18 is so young. I believe you’re making the right choice!   18 I had no idea what I wanted in life. Here I am at 27, now just finishing flight school as a certified pilot.   I support you! :) [end]
[start] People will lecture you. Don't let them. "Think about the infertile couples who would gladly adopt" I have unexplained secondary infertility (able to get pregnant, seemingly unable to carry a healthy baby) and I support abortion 110%! If this pregnancy is not for you, not at this time, then get rid of it. My sister opted to adopt out, and she regrets it to this day bc a bond WILL form whether you want it to or not. Lastly, allow yourself to mourn after, to feel however you need to feel. Don't let people tell you what is best for you and how you should feel.   All the luck and strength in the world. [end]
[start] Sending you lots of love and prayers for mental peace ❤️ [end]
[start] If you ever took antibiotics that can make your BC not work. [end]
[start] As a mother myself,  I think I would want to know and be supportive. If you have a good relationship with your mom,  then share.  If you know she's going to cause a scene, disown you, tell the whole damn family or try to change your mind,  keep it to yourself. Less drama for all. [end]
[start] Only positive words and encouragement to you dear.  It's never easy to be in your situation, and it must be even more frustrating since you took precautions.  I am glad that you have resources and a place to have a safe termination of your pregnancy. You are doing what's right for you and your future. I am stranger but I am proud of you. [end]
[start] should be able to take the abortion pill for that within a certain number of weeks. [end]
[start] You are doing the right thing.  Protect your future.  You will haveplenty of opportunities later in life for children.   Enjoy your youth :)  Much love to you. [end]
[start] I don't know if you have them where you are, but watch out for places posing as reproductive option centers. They will do everything they can to convince you that you're a terrible person for considering terminating your pregnancy. I have a couple friends who went to one by mistake and they said it was an awful experience. [end]
[start] >  I'm not yet ready to make the sacrifices I'd need to make for a baby and I'm very lucky that I live in a country where I can get rid of it.   You live in a world not only where you have choice but acceptance.  My mother's cousin was 18, unmarried and pregnant.  She committed suicide.  She jumped in the river and drowned.  She was Catholic, this was Poland and in the 1950s.  She wasn't so lucky. [end]
[start] I work as a welfare caseworker, and just want to say based on my experience with thousands of very young women who became mothers before they were ready, you're doing the right thing for yourself and your future. I hope everything goes OK and you come out of this safe and strong and ready to face whatever is next. [end]
[start] This is the right decision, regardless if other people are going to talk shit. There's no point in bringing a child into this (already fucked up) world if you are not fairly certain that you can provide what it will need - in every sense of the word, not just money.   I can only imagine how conflicting these decisions must be more women, but I hope you fully understand that what YOU think is right is the ONLY thing that matters.   Everything will be work out, best wishes, and good luck in college. :) [end]
[start] Oof... I like the username tho [end]
[start] Ok this is a personal experience with abortion & IUD. Its going to be veeerrrry long, so I'm sorry. Ive just never written about it like this before.  I got pregnant at 19. I was very wild, always partying, staying out legit all night, doing drugs, hooking up with multiple guys at once. I lived a very risky lifestyle to say the least. When I found out I was pregnant, I felt a mix of emotions...including joy. Maybe I thought having a child would fill a void I was feeling? Maybe I wanted the attention? Maybe both? But if I'm being honest, I truly did not even know who the father was. It could have been any of the 4 guys i was hooking up with around that time.I didn't want to listen to everything my family was saying about how it will basically ruin my life (not actually ruin my life, but I would be less likely to reach my full potential). I had no money and of course I was living at home. I dont think I realized how young I actually was until several years later. While I knew having an abortion was what was best for me, it doesn't mean i necessarily wanted to. I actually wanted to keep the baby. I wanted it. But I knew deep down everything my family was saying, was true. Because I wasn't very far along, I was able to have a medical abortion, which means you go into the office and the dr. gives you some pills to take in the office and then 4 more to take the next day to begin the process. The first pills are to basically terminate life. The second set of pills is to start the expulsion of the fetus. After the abortion, I got an IUD inserted a week later. I had constant bleeding for about 6 months and I had assumed it was my body still trying to get over the abortion, or trying to get used to the new BC. Eventually I went to my DR and they told me that my IUD was actually falling out, and I was bleeding because it was scratching me from the inside. They advised me to never get an IUD again.  I'm not going to lie, this was traumatizing at the time. I went through it by myself. I was in pain, the actual process is honestly traumatizing. The only person that was actually there for me was one of my good friends (who was one of the guys i had hooked up with around that time). He actually told me he thought I should have the abortion. And it was not because he could have MAYBE been the father, because this suggestion or advice came from a very loving, caring place. He was actually upset that I hadn't told him when I was doing it because he would have liked to have been there for me.Fast forward several years and I am actually in a long-term relationship with this guy. A few years ago, I had moved out of state so my birth control and insurance was a bit confusing to transfer over. Long story short, I got pregnant again.And I had another abortion. This one was very different though. Hoping I am able to speak about this not getting judged, here it goes.I found out I was pregnant. And we were unsure of what we wanted to do, so by the time I decided to have an abortion, I had just started the second trimester. Now, in this particular state, abortions are treated a bit differently than my home state. I had to go in for the initial appointment, and then I had to wait around a week or something and come back for the procedure.There were 2 options: I could be put to sleep, have the procedure done, and go home, but someone would have to wait in the lobby the entire timeor I could be given pain medication, have the procedure and go home, i would just have to get dropped off/picked up.I chose to just receive pain medication since my boyfriend could not be off work all day, though he did drop me off and pick me up.  Since I was already 12+ weeks (I think I was about 14-15), they gave me a pill to basically help dilate me. I had to wait several hours, and it was pretty painful. Cramping was really bad. So finally after a few hours, they give me the pain medication, and take me back to the room for my procedure.  Now this was pretty traumatizing as well. As I lay awake on the procedure bed, legs open, theres a few doctors or assistants at the end of the table by my feet, and one or 2 standing by my side, holding my hand. They try to make light of the situation, but to me it just feels corny. We all know why we're here, just dont speak to me and do it already. So they take the little vacuum thing and stick it inside me and while they did give me pain pills, i could still feel it. I felt a pulling on my insides and i tried to stay strong, but I think a tear or two slipped out. Finally I was done and i went to the bathroom to put on the underwear thing they give you and I was just bawling. I waited for my boyfriend to pick me up and as soon as i got in the car, i couldnt control my tears.  Now, these experiences may have been traumatic, and I have felt guilt, and sadness for a long while...But I couldn't imagine my life if I had actually continued with either pregnancy. I am relieved that I chose to abort.You will probably feel many different things, but in the end, I'm sure you will feel relief and realize it is what is best for you. You have an entire life ahead of you, just like me. I have an amazing 5 year plan, and at the end of it, I will be ready in every aspect (financially, emotionally, etc.) to have and raise a child. [end]
[start] Am I pregananant? [end]
[start] If you're not ready to take care of a baby, you should get the abotion. I support your decision. In my opinion, it's very responsible for you to recognize that you're not ready ( maybe mentally, physically, and financially ready) to have this baby. I hope your family will support your decision as well. Best of luck [end]
[start] There is no reason for you to explain yourself! I will keep you in my thoughts, it’s not something easy to do but you will get through it. [end]
[start] Oh man, my birth control failed when I was 21. I got an abortion, and ya know what? It wasn’t anything life changing, no pit to hell opens up, and you still get to be the same person you were before :) I got the pill since it was caught early and it was like a heavy period. good lucky honey bun [end]
[start] Only you know what is right for you, I was in this situation over a year ago, I had my appointment booked for an abortion but every evening I'd find myself crying and then I knew then I couldn't do it.  I cancelled my appointment and it was a weight lifted off my shoulders however the father went ape shit and abandoned me but who cares.  This isnt a story to change your mind I'm very pro choice, you need to do what is best for you and you'll know exactly how you feel and exactly what you want, you have a colourful future ahead and of course plenty of time to have kids in the future if you wish.  On the whole telling your mum, be careful because she may guilt you into keeping it, my mum expressed how sad it was that I was getting rid of a little life (her decision didn't sway me at all I always knew deep down I couldn't get rid) but she said she would be supportive of whatever I chose to do, just be wary.  Goodluck. [end]
[start] Probably one of the best decisions. No sense in bringing a child in to the world when they're not necessarily wanted atm. Definitely get some of your life set first. Going to school with a kid is not easy. Not impossible, but it's not fuckin easy. Do you, and do great things. Good luck with everything btw [end]
[start] It’s been so long since I’ve been in the dating scene.   Is it normal to move away from condoms that quickly when you’re dating someone new? The last time I dated someone new we used condoms for months. [end]
[start] You are going to feel rough after the procedure. Find someone that cares about you to rely on after it’s complete. Even though it is the right call for you be prepared to feel emotional and raw about it for awhile. Much love stay strong little one. [end]
[start] don’t let anything or anyone talk you out of doing what’s best for you. go do amazing things with this freedom that you’re giving yourself [end]
[start] Firstly, congratulations on beginning your journey through college. What and exciting time in your life! Secondly, I’ve never personally experienced what you are going through, so I can’t really comment on how you must be feeling right now. I want to let you know that there are people out here who fully support you through this decision. You are doing what you know is best for your future. Making this decision may be difficult or painful, but you are wise enough to choose your path anyways. I’m here for you, people love you, always. [end]
[start] Take care and enjoy your bright future x [end]
[start] Godspeed to you, i hope there are no complications. [end]
[start] I just want to say that I have known older, married women who got pregnant taking the pill. It is not 100 percent. Do not blame yourself. Do make a plan and figure out what to do. Do take care of yourself whatever the plan is. [end]
[start] I'm sorry this happened to you. I know from experience how hard the decision can be, and I'm glad you live somewhere that you can safely make the choice. [end]
[start] Fact is, you're very responsible and think a little about yourself, your future and its future. Raising a child is not that simple and you're right admitting it and realizing it.  It's your body, your rights and you're very strong through this situation.  Just don't forget, you're backed by your beloved ones !  I'm quite amazed about how strong an 18 like you are ! [end]
[start] Did you need antibiotics when you were sick? Many of them greatly affect the efficacy of birth control. [end]
[start] You do you, it is your life and your life alone to choose what you want to do with it. By the tone of this post you are not seeking advice and thats okay. You don't need the approval (or disapproval) of any one. The only other it concerns is the father. Again IT IS YOUR LIFE. Live it as you please. [end]
[start] I just recently had a young coworker go through something similar. Her parents are hardcore Christians and marriage definitely would have been the next step. She knew it wasn't a good time for her and wanted some points of view. I asked her how serious they were, how much she wanted to accomplish, and then I told her that she should do something about the pregnancy before the decision became impossible. She was on the pill too and felt so bad. I told her that she was doing what she could to not get pregnant so that obviously wasn't her next plan. Of course, she had issues with her relationship and how her boyfriend felt. The sad point was that her boyfriend was supportive but her other friends put a lot of doubt in her mind.   Her boyfriend was okay with her decision which was leaning really towards termination. Her friends said things like maybe he didn't want to be with her because he was okay with the termination. I just told her that they are both young, starting their lives and has a hiccup which they can get over. It's like it had to be all or nothing instead of a compromise to make the best decision for both of them. I told her that it's not like the world is running out of humans, she doesn't have to continue on the race...she has a responsibility to herself to be the best and then later, she'll be able to provide if she needs to. She ended up terminating the pregnancy, had a grown up discussion with her boyfriend, realized that she may have overreacted but that it was normal in a stressful situation. I'm really proud of her because she wants to do so much, even with a child she could but this way, the path is a little straighter. Good luck to you on your journey to become a nurse, you'll do so much good for you and others when you're ready or at least in a better position. [end]
[start] I had an abortion when I was 20, I had already established with my long term partner I never wanted kids and that if that situation did arise, I would definitely have an abortion. Unfortunately, due to the pregnancy hormones (that I didn't realize were such until later) and my mental illness, my bf (now ex, but much later) and I were talking about breaking up because I was out of control. I had an appointment set that I went to solo because my bf refused to take time off work to be with me and that evening I had the worst panic attack of my life, which put me into a suicidal state. I tried calling my bf who was at work and refused to leave to take me to the hospital stating "Well what do you want me to do?", so I had to call my parents who lived an hour away. Once they got to my place and got me to a semi-calm state I told them everything, and they supported me 100% and took me to the hospital. I ended up in court ordered Psychiatric for a week, but that's a different story.  Once I got out, I was still able to make it to my appointments for the abortion. I went alone even though my bf and I reconciled while I was hospitalized. The process was simple as I was still within time limits to take the pills. Honestly, the pill that triggered the actual abortion was stressful, like the worst period of your life and I do not recommend being alone. You don't have to tell them what you're going through but you can just say, "I'm feeling incredibly ill and I would like you here for company" have snacks and anything else that makes you feel better readily accessible.  Ultimately, this is your choice to make the "father" (quotes is a personal choice, not intended to degrade or shame the man you are with) does not have to know unless you know he will be supportive and not make this process more difficult. No one has to know unless you want them to know, not because of shame or stigma but because it is your life and your right. We're here for you, I'm here for you. Do what is best for you and leave everyone else out of it if that helps. [end]
[start] I am glad you are making this decision. It is your life and you are so very young. Having a child is a big decision with so, so many consequences that are absolutely not easy on your life, your psyche, your ambitions and your body. You are an 18 year old woman with the wish to become a nurse, and you are allowed to pursue this. You and your life is much, much more worth than a few splitting cells that can't survive on their own. I do think it is too awfully sentimental to talk about babys in this stage. It's not like you choke a living baby, it's stopping a starting pregnancy with a little clump of cells.  I do believe a living human being with dreams and needs is allowed to make this decision. None of this has to go down in flames just because of an unwanted pregnancy. You are allowed to do this for yourself and not feel guilty forever.   I hope you will have support.  Oh and here's a song! https://youtu.be/Npq_ieGCzes [end]
[start] Smart decision. Long term life planning is important you don’t want a derailment. Hope you are well [end]
[start] Sorry to hear you have to go through this, but all the best. [end]
[start] I don't have a uterus, so I'm not really qualified to give advice, but know that random Redditors wish you well! [end]
[start] I’m so glad you live in a place where you can fix this unfortunate situation.  Good luck with nursing school! [end]
[start] You go do what you gotta do. Much support and love from NY <3 [end]
[start] Sending every mental support to you! Remember to take care of your body after the abortion, the first week is crucial too. [end]
[start] I like how you’re mature and logical enough to make the right decision.  Hope it isn’t too painful and things return to normal soon. [end]
[start] I also had an unplanned pregnancy at 18 right before starting nursing school. You’ve got this OP. It’s gonna suck but then it will be over. The suckyness will continue to come and go for a little while but it will hurt much less than having an unwanted child. I hope you find as much confidence and strength in yourself for making this decision as I did. I hope that it continues to inspire you to become the best human you can be. Sending good vibes and positive thoughts your way. [end]
[start] Now if only my ex (24 year old female) thought like you. She's only been dating this new dude for like 6 months  (22 year old male) and she found out she was pregnant. Only way I found out was because she found a way to message me and tell me she's still in love with me and not the new dude. I told her that abortion was an option but she's religious and thinks a 3 week old thing is a child still. [end]
[start] good luck and a final word of advice:  fuck them kids [end]
[start] What you choose to do is none of my business. Sending you love and strength no matter what. [end]
[start] Is ok and everything will be ok, the only bad thing with abortion is when people don't support you and only tell you a list of bad things that will happen but they don't really know. Is your decision, if you want to tell people, do it, if you don't want, don't do it. I recomend you to not think of it a lot and don't imagine a life as a mother because your instincts can wake up and ruin your life and the baby's life, is also common that if you hear the baby's heart you can regret it, so don't hear it and DON'T LET THE FATHER HEAR IT, there are many stories where the father hears the heart of the fetus and convinces the mother to not abort, men hearts are weak xD  So don't overthink, protect your future and be a mother if you want after ending your studies and being independent so that you can give a better life to the baby. [end]
[start] Sorry this is a situation you have to face. Wishing you strength in a difficult time. [end]
[start] We support you sis [end]
[start] Good for you. You never have to stay pregnant if you would prefer not to be. Good luck with your studies! [end]
[start] I’m very lucky I live in a country where I can get rid of “it”.  Probably for the best. [end]
[start] When i went to get my mirena installed, they found a lump on my ovary and i had to wait to get it because i had to get the cyst removed. That delay was sufficed for me to get pregnant and I had an abortion.  I never regretted it and I told my closest friends without any judgement. I hope the same will go for you. [end]
[start] The generation raised by shitty parents learned their lessons on having kids at a young age. I agree with your choice. One day, you will be ready to parent but today you have to lay the foundation for that reality. I applaud you for thinking rationally about this. You can do it! [end]
[start] Can't add anything to what the others already have said. Best of luck to you. You made a wise decision. Take care. [end]
[start] Make sure your bf or whatever goes with you for support cause there's usually weirdo God freaks trolling those places. Hours long waiting. Pre procedure discussions, and that suction device.  Also no cell phones. Be prepared. [end]
[start] My surprise turns 7 in September ❤️ I just graduated college, too. I didn't go back til he was 4. It has been an amazing experience. [end]
[start] It’s going to take a lot of strength to get through this, but trust me when I say you have that strength, I promise [end]
[start] Consider letting the kid live.  I'm not telling you how to live your life, but just consider other options.  You have a little friend with you :)  Adoption is always an option :)  like I said. I'm not telling you what to do, just consider it.  Pax et bonum. [end]
[start]  I found out I was pregnant when I was 18 and was pressured into continuing the pregnancy.  My child is now 17 and is the light of my life but honestly no one should have a kid that young.  I knew so many other young parents that just struggle and just can't handle the pressure.  It turned out great despite everything, but I always try to be positive about abortion with young people I talk too because people shouldn't be guilted into having babies.  It completely changed the course of my life for the negative education wise, and opportunity wise. And that's ok for me but doesn't have to be that way for you. Good job being decisive and doing what's right for you. [end]
[start] I looked it up since no one here is doing these things and the chance of the child committing suicide is 4 times as big when adopted (~1% to ~4%). Less than 1% of adopted infants are unsuccesfull.  According to another research, 95% of women said abortion was the right choice. https://now.org/read-this/women-dont-regret-abortions/  Another research tells that a lot of women feel depressed(44%), the feel of loss(31%) and shame(27%). As you can see this is not true for most women. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8334275/  If I look at both sides and the chance of about 1% anyone reads this and your current situation I do think this is the right call for you to be happy. However if you look at the perspective of the baby, the baby wouldn't probably be unhappier when you let him be adopted.   TL;DR whatever the politically biased people on Reddit tell you, it doesn't make that much of a difference. It's all your choice; whether you abort the foetus or adopt it just make sure you stand by your decision. [end]
[start] Everything is gonna be okay, I promise. I was a year older than you when I was in the exact same situation. Like others have said, the people at the clinic will help you and give you all the info you need. If you’d like to pm me im always free :) [end]
[start] If more people made logical decisions like this there wouldn't be as many idiot apes carbon foot-print curb stomping the planet to death at an exponential rate.  Thank you for being an ape that uses critical thought and foresight.  You've been a beacon of hope for my day already.   I wish you a great abundance of patience and comfort. [end]
[start] Hugs. Do what you need to do. The sooner, the better. If you think you can, tell your mom. Good luck:) [end]
[start] Don't let your boyfriend try to guilt you into keeping it, although he obviously does have a right to know.  It would be up to him what he does after the fact. If he's worth his salt, he will be fully supportive of your decision. [end]
[start] Do you, girl. Do what you think is best for you ✨ Only tell people when you’re ready and if you think its safe. Also, you might wanna take a trip to the gynecologist after the abortion to get a checkup and check with your birth control. Hopefully you get everything figured out. I pray and hope you have a safe and healthy abortion and recovery.  1- remember that if not isn’t the best time to have kids, you can always have kids later IF YOU WANT THEM. You can have a baby yourself, adopt, or have a baby via surrogate. 2- Your choice is YOUR CHOICE. If the timing isn’t right because you are getting your life on your chosen path and you decide that the time isn’t right, or even if you simply don’t want it- that’s your choice, no one else’s 3- Dont let anyone let you feel small for your decision. You are a strong woman. 4- You’ll go through emotions after (as most do), but if it means you can continue your life plan without unwanted interruption, then its worth it.  Good luck with nursing school and I wish the best for you. Study hard and do great things ✨✨✨ I’ll keep you in my thoughts. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Do what’s best for you. You’re only young and it sounds like you have a great future ahead of you. Good luck with what you decide to do! [end]
[start] My advice? Don't tell anyone. It'll probably just bring more heartache than is worth it. Unless you know for a fact people are supportive, but it feels like most actually aren't. [end]
[start] sending you strength vibes...create your stability [end]
[start] Ahh sorry about the rough situation. Glad to hear you're taking it seriously. Dont have mids until you're ready. Ignore the assholes in this thread. [end]
[start] We all wish you well. At the end its your decision but speaking to planned parenthood first is a good option. And make sure its a proper planned parenthood clinic and not one of the clinics that  jon oliver was talking about disguising themselves as a clinic.  Your options are  1. Abort 2. Keep 3. Give for adoption   No wrong choice here really. Its what you can handle and if the father is a keeper, as a guy myself i would like to be informed but understand that at the end its what you/you guys can do.  With regards to your family you can tell them after the fact if you are worried they wont support you. But i would hope your parents will support you with whatever decision you make.   What ever you decide you need a proper support structure as well. [end]
[start] You’re brave for posting this, wishing you all the strength that the process goes smoothly! My PM is open to ask what to expect or just vent. Although if I remember correctly they have a hotline for the latter~ [end]
[start] Supporting you all the way! [end]
[start] Some meds and supplements counter birth control.  Antibiotics esp. [end]
[start] Good for you! Pursue your career in nursing and start a family whenever you’re actually ready :) [end]
[start] good luck with it all, and stay strong [end]
[start] Like you said, thank God you live in a country that allows you the right to do what you wish with your own reproductive system. In the US my daughter will no longer have such a right. Good luck & godspeed. [end]
[start] I was in your same position at 17, I knew right away what I wanted to do. Just have strength, take care of yourself, and good luck with the procedure. My advice is to get some ice cream or something with a loved one afterwards... then go snuggle up somewhere cozy. I'm 19 now and I think about it from time to time but it doesn't weigh heavy. Make sure you bring a close friend or family member along if you're comfortable :) stay strong & much luck! [end]
[start] >If there's any advice you'd be willing to share I'd love to hear it.  Abort. [end]
[start] That's great you live in a pro-choice country and you're taking action to do what is right for you and your future. You don't need to tell a soul if you don't want to, it is up to you who you talk about it to or not. Good luck and enjoy the future that litres ahead of you! X [end]
[start] I'd also be careful telling your current boyfriend if you've only been dating a month. They could have an adverse reaction to it. Unless you know they won't and know them well, their stances e.t.c- sure. Just be aware it might happen and question if you can handle him in a already stressful time like this.   Everything will be okay, xox. [end]
[start] Ive had an abortion and lost a child, too.  Nothing will prepare you for what you are going thru or about to got through. TRUST me on this point... itll be uncomfortable and there will be people ready to call you a baby killer. Dont tell anyone irl, and just take comfort that ending the baby's life is better than putting it in foster care where lots of terrible things happen and the child grows up already damaged from your rejection, with too many other unwanted babies [end]
[start] My advice from two decades of friends in your situation: Don't tell the father, or if you do wait until after the fact. At best, it'll confuse the fact that it's your decision; at worst it could lead to him harming you; somewhere in the middle it could lead to him substituting his decision for your own. [end]
[start] Your body, your decision. You do what's good for you, no one else will. [end]
[start] Consider an IUD! Some places will do a joint visit and so you can get the IUD and the abortion in one trip. [end]
[start] Good on you for making the hard choice. It'll be way better for everyone involved. Including yourself. Don't let these monsters make you feel bad. You're brave. [end]
[start] Just get an abortion. I don't know if I'd even bother telling anyone unless you know you'll 100% get support. Anything less, I just wouldn't bother. You have us for support. [end]
[start] I'm sorry to hear you're in this situation, sounds like something you didn't anticipate. It's good you found out early, there's usually more options in this case. If you're in Australia (by chance) you can get medication to terminate in the early weeks, for example. Depending on your mum's beliefs and the relationship you have, I would recommend telling her. It's a situation in adult life where she can really be there for you. I wish you all the best, I hope it goes smoothly. [end]
[start] Good luck to you OP. You’re doing what is best for you and that is all that matters. Stay strong throughout this and remember that no matter what anyone says, you are doing the right thing. Good luck with going to university too! You’ll make a great nurse and you’ll do great things in your life. Stay strong :) [end]
[start] My advice is to analyze whether or not your mom will be supportive or if she’ll support your decision no matter what and then decide to tell her. You sound like a strong and intelligent person and I am sure you can handle this but it is also good to have some family support, especially from your mom.   You will be A-okay at the end and everything will be fine so don’t think of this too much because this is natural and a lot of people go through it. You are not alone in this and I fully support your decision to put yourself first :) [end]
[start] Good for you for taking care of yourself and doing what’s best for you. [end]
[start] This happened to me at 16, thankfully I was young enough to blame my parents for the decision but the final choice was all mine. I had guilt, very strong at first and then less after a while. But if I had to go back there no way I would do it any differently.  I’ve lived so much life and battled so many battles and if that child had been on this earth it would be the 18yo of a much crazier fully alcoholic mother.   Do it, you may feel later that you made the wrong decision, but your 35yo self thanks you [end]
[start] Do what you need to do and don't let anyone talk you out of it.   Make sure you have support if you can.   This is your life, enjoy it sans kids for now! [end]
[start] Your body. Your choice. Don't tell your mom if you think it'll make her cut you off, maybe tell her in the future. I just learned of a birth control patch that you may want to consider trying? I have a nexplanon implant but it does have it's down sides.   Take care of yourself and seek therapy if you feel you need it. Only positivity. [end]
[start] Your body is your choice, and you're very strong for going through this. Good luck to you. [end]
[start] Good. Abort that shit and focus on your career. [end]
[start] “I live in a country where I can get rid of it...” [end]
[start] Hey girl, I know exactly how you feel. I also got pregnant on the pill. I decided to keep my baby and I’m currently doing my school work as I type. My beautiful baby is smiling, laughing, playing as I work on my homework. Just letting you know it’s possible to accomplish all of your dreams with a baby.   P.S. I’ve been on the depo shot for 8 months and it’s working like a charm! [end]
[start] At 18, these super-adult decisions are still new to you, but I would simply say that the longer you wait, the heavier moral choice you have. If you today feel this is the right choice, you IMO are not hurting anyone yet. These words are chosen very carefully, a cell becomes a "person" later.. at some point it becomes an important decision, today it is exclusively about you, and if you feel burdened by the situation and prefer it to be gone, do it.  As you've noticed it's easy to do it again once you're ready ;) [end]
[start] Do whatever you feel is the best decision for you. Wishing you well. [end]
[start] Do whatever you feel you gotta do, sending love and strength your way! [end]
[start] Be brave, do what is best for YOU and YOUR future. Take care of this and go on and continue your academic career and become an amazing nurse. The time will come where you will be able to have a beautiful family if you choose to do so. You don’t have to tell anyone about this if you don’t want to. I recommend getting an IUD implant. The nexplanon is good for 3 years and you have less than 1/100 chance of getting pregnant. Hang in there. Sending you the absolute best wishes and hugs. [end]
[start] Sending lots of strength your way. Definitely do what is best for you. Side note the iud and ius are amazing birth control. I was on it for 3 years and never got pregnant and came off it when I was ready for a child and now I'm back on the IUS. Cannot recommend enough. [end]
[start] Too young. Abort it. It is literally not human. [end]
[start] Oh honey. I got pregnant when I was 18! It is OKAY. You’re gonna be okay! Whatever you choose. I ended up keeping my son for personal beliefs because I personally couldn’t have an abortion. Children are beautiful. And the experience is WONDERFUL. I’m Christian. But I won’t spew such ignorant shit about “ITS WRONG” “YOURE A MURDERER” you’re not ready? That’s okay. It’s your choice at the end of the day. Don’t let anyone tell you different! We all have slip ups. It’s life [end]
[start] You have to attend university to be a nurse? da heck? [end]
[start] If you have a good relationship with your mom, you should tell her, you might need her by your side after the abortion... If not your mom, then tell a good friend. So what's right for you...  Go study, have a career, find the real partner of your life, then one day you'll have a baby (if you want to... ) There's a long way ahead of you! 😄  Go enjoy it to the fullest.  Wish you the best of luck! ❤️ [end]
[start] Do what you need to do and don't let anyone talk you out of it.   Make sure you have support if you can.   This is your life, enjoy it sans kids for now! [end]
[start] Sending hugs and strength. I’m so sorry you have to deal with this, but make the choice that’s best for you. Your patients will be lucky to have you taking care of them.   It also might be worth looking into an IUD or implant. I’ve been thrilled with mine and it’s given me a lot more peace of mind than the pill did. [end]
[start] I advise against telling anyone you think may try to persuade you from an abortion. It will just make things that much harder. :hugs: [end]
[start] There will be negativity if you tell anyone. There will be positive if you tell anyone. Do what you think is best for you. [end]
[start] Be brave! Do what you feel is right, don’t let anyone tell you what to do in this situation, it’s your body. Good luck with uni! Stay strong 💕 [end]
[start] Whatever you think you should do, you should do. [end]
[start] I’m proud of you for keeping so calm. Talk to your mom if you feel comfortable with it, don’t if you don’t. If you need to talk, I’m here too. Good on you for taking control of your own situation. [end]
[start] Do what YOU want to do. Don’t let anybody ever tell you what they think is right or wrong. It’s not their body and it’s not their life. Do what’s best for you. I’ve been through this so if you want to chat about it please message me.  Stay strong to your thoughts and feelings and trust yourself. [end]
[start] Your choice. Your rules. [end]
[start] Awesome [end]
[start] First of all, sending a lot of love & support your way♥️ An abortion can be extremely emotionally taxing for some, so my advice would be to consider a few counseling sessions before and after your appointment. Good luck & I hope everything goes smoothly. [end]
[start] Were you perhaps taking any antibiotics around the time of conception? It’s not uncommon for antibiotics to interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Just a thought💭 [end]
[start] Its your choice man, don't let anyone tell you otherwise [end]
[start] Pill is at most 95% effective. Not 100% [end]
[start] I 100% support whatever decision you make. As an adoptee I do feel the need to throw adoption out there as a consideration though. I wish you the best of luck. [end]
[start] Sending loads of support and understanding your way! [end]
[start] Were you taking antibiotics because they can affect the the effectiveness on your birth control.   Honestly give yourself some time to digest the situation, look into all of your options and do your research on after care for yourself if you do go with an abortion. You shouldn't feel guilty about your choices but it's still good to talk to a trusted person afterwards whatever you decide, I've heard of some cases of people falling into a bout of depression after an abortion either due to a hormonal fluctuation or just feeling guilt if they made the right choice. Having someone to talk to is important to keep you mentally healthy especially if you're about to start college soon which can be a very stressful experience. Good luck with whatever you choose to do. [end]
[start] Good luck and hope it goes well [end]
[start] Dont let anyone make you feel bad for doing what you need to do. [end]
[start] I can tell you this much, had an abortion when I was 22, changed the course of my life, never shook the feeling of changing the course of my life and my kids, 39 now, still regret it at least once a week.   &#x200B;  Fundamentally changes how you see yourself forever. [end]
[start] Take time for self care after the abortion. Don’t let anyone try to make you feel like a bad person for doing what’s best for you.  Sending you strength and positivity! [end]
[start] good luck in university, go be a great nurse 🤗 [end]
[start] I know people have very different thoughts on this, but you truly need to do what's best for you. I wish you the best of luck, and have faith that you're making a good decision. [end]
[start] You’ll be ready when you’re ready. [end]
[start] Best of luck op. Don’t feel guilty about what’s doing best for you. [end]
[start] Good luck sister. Be strong. I dont know you but I'm thinking of u :) [end]
[start] Honestly, everything will be ok. You're doing amazing. [end]
[start] I wish you the best of luck! You are very brave and very lucky as you have said to live in a country where you can choose on your body, hopefully someday that will change where i live too. anyways i hope everything turns out well [end]
[start] I recently went through this on the other side, I accidentally got a girl pregnant and we were both not in the place to keep it.  It’s an extremely hard decision and hard thing to go through, make sure you’re reaching out to supportive people through out.  Hope everything works out. [end]
[start] Good luck! [end]
[start] So happy that you've made a decision that wasn't easy, but was well thought out and considerate of the people in your life. Children deserve the absolute best. You deserve a chance to provide the best.   When you have your appointment, keep strong with your decision as much of the paperwork and videos are geared to make you feel terrible.   Also, I second the revision of birth control options. The implant or IUD are the best in terms of prevention. Good luck! [end]
[start] Do you girl! No shame in it, keep your head up!! [end]
[start] First off, my daughter is your age and I hope she has the common sense that you are showing.  Secondly, my mother was in your place... same age  same goals.  My family tried to pressure he to get an abortion.  She stood her ground and made it work. Life wasn't easy for her and me but she got through it.  Would it have been better for her situation? Hell yeah.  If I could go back in time and give her advice, I would tell her at that age to focus on her.   She became a nurse and went on to have 4 more children.     Best of luck, there are no wrong answers. [end]

[start] Hey , I think I am just proud of you for knowing what your priorities in life is and being able to think logically in the midst of this chaos thrown at you. You will be a great nurse who will provide logical, empathetic, and high quality healthcare all under pressure. Good luck to your uni life and future careers although something tells me you wont even need it to smash through everything ! [end]
[start] *hugs* it'll be okay, you're a great person for being self aware like this. [end]
[start] If I were in your situation rn, id get an abortion. sure its killing lofe but at the moment, it jas no nerves so it wont feel it and also, if you have the kid, you arent ready to handle having a kid so it growing up with the issue of a possible lack of a father or not being able ti afford things like insurance and school supplies could have an impact on its life.  TLDR: best solution imo would be to have an abortion [end]
[start] So ultimately, I believe it's your body your choice, but I also believe the "would've been father" has at least the right to know, that's just me but maybe he wants it and you can give custody to him. My ex and I had an abortion, we agreed at the time but soon after it really hit us, it emotionally destroyed her and she blamed me and over the years the thought of it hurts me more and more, kinda wish I had a family now. Anyway, long story short, it's your call but you really need to be emotionally prepared afterwards, good luck OP. [end]
[start] Just so you know for the future, the pill isn't 100% effective so if your boyfriend is cumming inside you, which it sounds like he probably is, you are using the pill wrong.. He's still supposed to pull out, if not wear a condom still ideally.. [end]
[start] I wish you the best of luck. Stay strong and follow your gut! Only tell the people that you know will love and support you, even if they disagree with you. Take your time and think through every step of the way.    I recommend the nexplanon birth control implant. My insurance covered it completely and it was just a split second of discomfort for 3 years of pretty much foolproof pregnancy prevention! After a pregnancy scare I was terrified to have any sort of sex life until a doctor recommended this to me for my painful and heavy periods. I now have no periods and no concerns about pregnancy.   (I don't really agree with abortions, but) Your decision is yours and I hope your life is better for it and you can reach your goals and have a family if/when you feel it's right! I would be remiss to not say, just think about it. Regardless of what you decide, spending a while thinking about it is worth the peace of mind.   Praying for your peace and navigation of a very difficult situation! [end]
[start] Just know it will all be okay. You make whatever decision you feel is best for you. If the father isnt going to support you, there are organizations out there that will help :) .. Good luck, and stay strong 💪🏽. You’re not alone. [end]
[start] post this in r/Conservatives for the lol's [end]
[start] I've been in your shoes and made the same decision.  Now, almost 10 years later, I am 5 weeks along with my first child. All the best to you.  And remember- any choice you make in this situation is the right one. [end]
[start] No advice, I’ve never been there before. Just wanted to say you’re strong just for sharing & if there’s anything people can help you with, make it known. Praying for you! [end]
[start] Hi OP! I can share some info on medication abortions if you PM me with questions. Not sure how far along you are. [end]
[start] Hell yeah! Kill that baby :) Yeetus that fetus as they say :P xD [end]
[start] In my family we keep abortions secret, but good for you. [end]
[start] If your in the Bible belt ignore theses people. I was told I was an abomination and shouldn't exist because I was born out of wedlock.   You got this ignore these people. Live your life for you. [end]
[start] sending you love and support, stranger [end]
[start] Best of luck to you and all the ((((HUGS)))) and good vibes and Internet Stranger well wishes.  I hope everything goes smoothly. [end]
[start] The decision is all your. But be fully aware that your close one can’t help you, if they don’t know you need support. [end]
[start] Sending much love towards you and your boyfriend! [end]
[start] When you get to your university, check out their mental health counselors and talk to them about stuff. It gets really easy to harbor mixed feelings. [end]
[start] Just in case no one has said it yet, you probably didn't take the pill wrong. They're only up to 99% effective if taken perfectly. That still leaves a 1% margin of error for body chemistry, timing, etc. Don't blame yourself, it happens. [end]
[start] Sending support for whatever you decide. [end]
[start] Sending you love and support! [end]
[start] I was a teen mom so I know EXACTLY what you're going through and everything! Do what you need to do and if you're not ready, then have an abortion. Your boyfriend MIGHT try and convince you not to but YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR LIFE!!! DON'T LET HIM GUILT TRIP YOU INTO DOING SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT READY FOR!! Some men will promise the moon and stars for you to do what they want you to do. Just remember that you know what's best for you!! I wish you the best of luck sweety!! And when you're older and have done what you've wanted to do & when you're ready to have a family, that's when you should do it!! I love my kids to death & I wouldn't change having them for anything!! BUT I do wish that I would have waited & had them later on in life because it was the hardest thing to do, supporting them & working for shit pay!! I couldn't do anything i planned to do with my life because i had them so young. If i was older & had done something for myself & gone to college, i could've given them the life they deserved. They deserved so much more than what i was able to give them!! They're AMAZING young men but they could have had a GREAT life had I been older and had my shit together!! DO NOT LET ANYBODY ELSE, ESPECIALLY A MAN, TRY AND MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING THE WRONG THING!! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY DOING THE RIGHT THING & WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS!!! [end]
[start] We support you. When you're not ready you aren't ready and you have a lot of decisions left to make. I hope it goes well. [end]
[start] Sending love and strength your way! I had a pregnancy scare when I was 18 and I would have done the same thing if I actually became pregnant. I hope everything goes well for you. ❤️ [end]
[start] I would just say to make sure your family doesn't convince you otherwise.  I know enough people who had family convince them to keep the baby and that they would help, or even that the grandparents are willing to take the kid, and that shit has almost never worked out the way they were led to believe.  You know that you are not ready.  If you have spoken to the father, then that's it.  There is really nobody else who needs to be a part of the discussion.  &#x200B;  Good luck to you. [end]
[start] The **only** advice you should take from ~~socially retarded children~~ Reddit is: **Never** take advice from ~~socially retarded children~~ Reddit. [end]
[start] OP I wish the very best for you. I had an abortion at the age of 20 while in Uni. I was with the father for 6 years and I was always careful, but contraception fails from time to time. It’s scary and you’re going to experience a lot of emotions and physical pain from the abortion ( think the worst cramps you’ve ever had). I hope that you have someone safe to talk to that will not judge you and will be there for you to pick you up and take you home after the procedure. You will go through some mental pain too. Even though it was the right thing for me and for you too it still is hard. Sending you so much love and support [end]
[start] I just went through this, if you have any questions, feel free to PM me. [end]
[start] You are doing the right thing. I also had one at that age. It was the right decision. Now I'm 32 with a wonderful 3 year old. I lived out my 20's. I got to be young and be somewhat care free. I got to grow into myself as a person and learn and make mistakes.  Knowing what I know now about how hard it is to have a newborn and a toddler... There's no way I could have handled it.   I might get shit for saying this, but 99% of the girls I know who had a baby under the age of 25/26 went into a crazy tailspin. They ended up going thru a terrible break up within 2 years. Then they dropped their kid off to live with their parents for a couple of years, while they partied and pretended they had no responsibilities. It sucked for everyone involved. [end]
[start] Be strong! I’m sending you love and strength.   I’m proud of you for being responsible and figuring out how to deal with this in the best way for you at this point in your life. I can’t imagine this can be easy for you. I hope everything goes as smoothly as possible and you have a wonderful, love and happiness filled future.  I’m sorry this happened to you at all, the past can’t be changed, so I hope this makes you a stronger, more well rounded person. [end]
[start] Don't tell your mom if possible. Only your BF and doctors should know. If you tell her she might try to guilt trip you into adoption or keeping it at worst. Your mom may not even know what to do. Like, do you tell her how much and how often you have sex? It would be weird or bordering on insane for a parent to be kept apprised of your sexual activities. Also, since you're only a month along, it's basically an extra strong BC pill (in the most simple of terms).  If you're feeling unsure of the process, talk to the physicians there about the process and afterwards, if you feel guilty or remorseful of your decision, talk to them about professional mental help. They're there to help. I would also switch to a different method of BC since the pill obviously either didn't work for you or there was inconsistent timing on taking it. There's so so many easy options out there. Take charge of your health. You've got this! :) [end]
[start] Sending you love, hun! I've had an abortion as well, it was the best decision I could've made at the time! 💙🌹 [end]
[start] When you go to the clinic don't go alone, friend, current boyfriend, mom someone to help you after the procedure and be there for you. Ignore those idiots that stand outside put on headphones, ear muffs something to drown out the noise of their nonsense. All the best to you and I second the NuvaRing or an IUD my wife has had both and she liked them. [end]
[start] Commenting as someone who’s been in your shoes, I can maybe offer sole support. Got pregnant on the pill many years ago and made the hard decision not to continue with the pregnancy. It was the saddest and best decision I ever made, especially thinking how different my life would be today and how miserable the situation would’ve been on my child, my now ex partner, and myself.  Best of luck moving forward! [end]
[start] It will be ok. If you feel guilt and pain afterwards that’s ok too. This is an emotional thing you’re doing. I made the choice and if I hadn’t no one would be better off for it but I still went through some tough emotions coping with the necessary decision I made. Reach out if you need help. Just because it is the right choice doesn’t mean you can’t feel the way you feel about it no matter what that is. [end]
[start] Good luck love. <3 [end]
[start] I’ve been there, do what feels right for you! I was going to do the exact same thing, but fortunately I had a miscarriage and never had to go through with the abortion. Your body, your choice! [end]
[start] I don't really have anything to add. You seem to have figured this out. Power to you. [end]
[start] You’re making a very smart and brave choice by doing this. You seem like you’ve got your head on straight and I’m sure you’ll make an amazing mother when you’re older and more settled if that’s what you want. Much love. [end]
[start] This is way too personal. I would never ask this kind of personal advice from Internet. People judge. Again, it's up to you and only family and friends will help you in this situation not Internet. [end]
[start] Replying as someone who has been where you are. I became pregnant last year and decided that I was not ready to be a mother. The father agreed with my decision, and I chose to terminate my pregnancy. I just want you to know that some feelings of regret or remorse may arise, and that is completely normal, but it does not mean that you made the wrong decision. Just know that time heals, and you have support. Sending love. [end]
[start] Just no you make your own decisions don’t let anyone decide for you , stay strong . [end]
[start] Support is the most necessary and being outspoken about it helps with the process.  Just to relate my girl and I are in our early twenties and same decision had to be made, in all truth my girlfriend and I where dating for 3 months when she got pregnant even though I've known her for years. We decided to keep the baby as firstly the pregnancy was too far along and secondly I've always wanted to be a young father. The other end of the spectrum we are the happiest family with a baby daughter that makes life all the more amazing. It is choice that only you can make and a decision that will change your life and having an abortion has a terrible mental impact and puts strain on relationships as ive seen family go through with it. I considered adoption if i wasn't going to be a father. But yeah whatever your decision you can never have enough support. All the best. [end]
[start] Hey OP I was on the same boat as you 7 months ago. Found out I was pregnant, was about to start school, difference is I am a little older, 21 at the time. If you would like to reach out to talk I’d be more than happy to :) and I just wanted to let you know you’ve made the right decision! Lots of love and take care [end]
[start] Love and hugs! [end]
[start] Sending you love and strength. It will all be okay. [end]
[start] if theres any chance he will not be supportive or try to stop you from having the abortion, then wait til tell him until after the abortion. [end]
[start] Good luck. Just know that it will be difficult to process whatever decision you would have made, so no regrets. [end]
[start] Wish you the best in getting through this. You’re making the choice that is the right one, right now. [end]
[start] make sure y’all using condoms. condoms+birth control= lower risk [end]
[start] Unpopular opinion, you should keep it, dont let societies pressures of timelines and what you "should do" make you murder your unborn baby. You are strong and you can raise a baby and still live a baby and successful life. [end]
[start] Best of luck! [end]
[start] >... for a baby and I'm very lucky that I live in a country where I can get rid of it.  I’m pro-choice and I support your choice of getting an abortion procedure, but this sentence...oof. This is verbiage that gives us a bad name.   It might be pedantic, but I think it’s incredibly important and I’d like to point out that you’re not getting rid of a baby. You’re pregnant, but that is not a baby inside you...yet.   Understand that there’s nothing wrong with your decision. You have support. However, try and be mindful of your verbiage. It can lead to serious misinformation and poor perception on the part of those less informed. [end]
[start] Congratulations [end]
[start] there really is no wrong action to take so don't think too hard about it. [end]
[start] I'd say *don't* tell family, and if you do, only tell them afterwards.  Good luck! [end]
[start] Just be honest and confident. We all have problems, if you‘re honest you can resolve/find a solution to a situation/problem much faster&more accurate. People died bcs of lies ukno... [end]
[start] Do what you need to do! Best of luck to you. Be safe and take care of yourself. Prioritizing yourself now enables you to best take care of your future family. Enjoy university, you have a bright future ahead! [end]
[start] Thank you for understanding me. By the way, you really might want to talk to someone about it, a sister maybe? My DM is open if you'd like to talk to me instead, you're answer only showed me you're not letting this get into you, which is very nice, I'll pray you get through this. [end]
[start] I've been there, it's frightening, and there's hardly anybody that's wishy washy on either side. With that said, if you haven't already, take time to get your head right before you decide anything. It's your choice but it's a big one so make sure it's the best one you can make. Stay strong and good luck! [end]
[start] Good luck, make sure you've got someone you trust with you that day. I could understand it would be quite emotional so having someone to hold might make it easier. [end]
[start] Bruh. Get an IUD. [end]
[TITLE] Found $4000 dollars in a Walmart parking lot today. [TITLE]
[start] I think your experience was very human. Thanks for sharing it.   When I think about situations like these and how I would react I often picture myself as the party who lost the the item/money. I would be devastated if I lost 4K, it’s not a small sum. If that happened to me I would hope someone would be kind enough to return it. I would like to be that for someone else. [end]
[start] I’d return it also the guilt would just eat away at me if I didnt. honestly though there’s no reason why that guy should be walking about with 4K in a Walmart parking lot or with that much cash on him to begin with god forbid someone robs him or something. Hopefully that guy learns from his mistake and thankfully he had someone as nice and honest as you to return it [end]
[start] I've found wallets full of cash before, and it reminds me of the time I used self check-out and got a couple hundred dollars cash back, then left in a hurry and forgot the money. Realized that about a mile down the road and came back, and the person behind me in line had turned it in instead of taking it. I was a single parent of two young children and that was my FAFSA money, I needed it badly, and I was so relieved and grateful because I would've been so fucked without it - I could never put someone through that. I could never be selfish and devastate someone by taking something that wasn't mine. [end]
[start] Thanks for being one of the good people out there. [end]
[start] I would probably do the exact same as you. Get excited for a minute, then realize I couldn’t live with myself knowing there’s probably someone out there who is just distraught because they just lost 4K. [end]
[start] I’d return it, but it would absolutely kill me to do so. $4000 would clear my remaining debt finally and put me in a position to actually live rather than survive. I think I’d even regret giving it back even though I know it’s the right thing to do. Good for you, OP, I’m sure that dude was so happy to get his money back. [end]
[start] I'd really like to think that I would do the same. I know my immediate instinct would be to keep it, but I think the guilt would get the best of me. On the other hand, I've lived with guilt before... [end]
[start] Getting ahead shouldn't mean that someone else has to fall behind. [end]
[start] Character. Pure character.   With so much madness going on, you chose to be a bright spot in the world. It sucked to give up, but you knew it belonged to someone and you chose to do the right thing.  Good for you. I'd like to think more would be willing to do the same. [end]
[start] As someone who just had the opposite experience (someone stole $200+ from my husbands wallet in his glovebox) THANK YOU for returning it. Hopefully whoever stole it needed it more than us. [end]
[start] In my country it is mandatory by law to give a finders-fee on 10% when cash is found and returned. [end]
[start] Glad to see honest people left. [end]
[start] Someone once said something regarding these sorts of situations that always stuck with me: ask yourself, what is the price of my integrity? I can't shake it now. If I get the wrong change back or something, and think about just keeping it, I immediately find myself thinking 'is my integrity really only worth $5?' Or whatever the price is. Nice to know yours is worth at least $4000! [end]
[start] I 110% would've kept it without a second thought so good on you [end]
[start] I saw a young kid crying outside of Walmart.  When I asked him why he was crying, he told me he had lost $200.  I felt really bad for him, so I gave him $40 out of the $200 I had found about ten minutes earlier.  When God blesses you, I believe you should share that blessing with others. [end]
[start] they duped you - the employees are splitting it [end]
[start] Honestly idk what I would do, on one hand if I found 4000 I’m keeping that shit, but on the other hand I’d probably feel guilty about it for the rest of my life. [end]
[start] That's...I hope I would have the strength. It's more money than I've ever had in my life. [end]
[start] You: NO WAY DUDE TAKE THE MONEY 4K IN THE BANK YOU ARENT SERIOUSLY GONNA TRY AND FIND THE PEOPLE WHO LOST IT ARE YOU?  Also You: Yes [end]
[start] I once stayed at a hotel while traveling for work and on my last day there I caught a glimpse of something sparkling on the floor. I looked closer and saw that stuck in the carpet was what looked to me like a diamond ear ring. Money was really tight at the time and I thought about keeping and selling it.  When I checked out, I gave them my room key, and then handed over the ear ring and told them that I found it on the floor in my room.  I don't know if it ever got back to its proper owner, but what made me hand it over was thinking about how much my wife cherishes the jewelry that I have given her over the years and how devastated she would be if she lost something like that.   All this to say, OP, you did the right thing. [end]
[start] I’d probably take 100 and return the rest... idk. Maybe I would return all of it. If I kept the whole thing, the guilt would eat me away. I’d probably return it all. [end]
[start] this happened to be a few years ago but it was only $500. i didn't really trust that if i turned the money in that it would find its way back to its true owner so i donated it to charity. some people i know found out about it and gave me a big pat on the back but i would have felt better if i kept things anonymous. i still feel a little guilty that i didn't make an effort to find the owners. and i feel stupid that i just gave the money away. oh well. maybe it helped some needy kids somewhere. [end]
[start] Something similar happened to me at work once.  I'm a quality control tech at a processing plant, and as I was leaving out for the day and headed towards the front gate, some guy in front of me reaches into his pocket for something, maybe his phone. And as he pulls his hand back out, he doesn't notice that a whole wad of cash came out with it... It falls on the ground right in front of me. Not sure how much it was, but probably at least a few hundred in $20's. It was Friday, so it was payday.  My immediate reaction is to bend down, pick it up, and as I do so I call out to him loudly, because he was walking pretty quickly, probably eager to get to his car. He looks back over his shoulder, almost seeming irritated at the interruption, until I hold the bundle of bills up and tell him he dropped it. Shock shows on his face for a moment, followed by relief, and he thanks me profusely.  It hit me later that, you know, I could have just picked it up and not said anything. I make more than a production worker... but not a lot more. An extra few hundred would definitely help out. But I also knew why I couldn't do that, why my immediate reaction was to yell for him to stop. That two or three hundred was his rent payment, his car payment, his groceries... something. I don't carry cash like that, but if I was to lose that much out of a weekly paycheck, it would hurt like hell. No way could I do that to someone else. That was his money that he had worked for all week, not mine. And hell, just seeing the relief on his face, knowing that I helped out, that was good enough. [end]
[start] I would also turn it in because most likely if someone dropped that much money in the Walmart parking lot it is money they really really need. On the other hand, if I found it in Mar-a-Lago I would be much more tempted to just pocket it. [end]
[start] Having seen *No Country For Old Men*, I would keep walking and not look back.  I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole. [end]
[start] I had a somewhat similar situation happen... here’s the story:   Went to Mexico with my fiancé who is now my hubby. We were in the airport in NJ at the very end of our trip, getting ready to find a shuttle and head back to where our car was parked waiting for us. I had to go to the bathroom, so we found the closest one. I was washing my hands at the sink when I noticed a set of rings sitting on the side of the sink next to me. No one else was in the bathroom. I stopped and thought, “what do I do?” So naturally, I looked around again and picked them up.   Brought them out to show my fiancé. It was a set of four rings- one very large diamond (so large I was sure it was fake) and three other smaller bands, all completely wrapped in smaller diamonds. I’d by lying if I said I didn’t check to see if it was my size. Not because I was going to keep them, but because I was curious what a rock like that would look like on my hand 😂 I was still so sure it was fake. It had to be!   We talked about what we should do. He was telling me that it could be worth a lot of money and that if no one was around, we should consider keeping them. But he was just as torn as I was. I felt, if I returned them to lost and found, one of the workers there could just pocket the rings. I realllllyyyy didn’t want that to happen. If I didn’t return them, they probably would never end up in the owner’s hands again and I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.... sooooo. I decided to put them in my pocket....   .... and find the nearest lost and found desk.   I explained what happened to two individuals behind the counter. We made sure to ask, “What happens if the owner doesn’t come looking for them?” One of the ladies, while trying the rings on herself (apparently we all do things like this lol) said that if the owner doesn’t look for them they get sent to the main building in Texas. They weren’t sure what happened to the items after that. The other lady argued and said that if the owner didn’t come for them, that I should have the right to keep them since I found them. I obviously liked her answer better!   So, I gave my number to that lady and told her to please let me know what ends up happening. I would feel unfulfilled to just leave it at that and never know what happened.   Fast forward maybe ten minutes: Fiancé and I are waiting at the bus stop for our shuttle. We see it pulling up. Suddenly my phone rings and it’s a random number. I answer, slightly confused. It’s the original owner!!! IN TEARS! She was sobbing on the phone explaining that she noticed (probably minutes after I had returned the rings) that she didn’t have them on anymore. She took them off to wash her hands and forgot them at the sink. She asked if I was still at the airport. I told her where I was and what I was wearing, and she asked me not to move. A couple minutes later she comes running up to me, tears running down her face. Gives me a big hug (before Covid obviously lol). She proceeded to tell me that the rings had been passed down through her family for years (and also that her hubby would have lost his mind if she lost them for good). She was incredibly thankful and I felt so warm knowing the history behind the rings and that I did the right thing. She said that the rings were valued at over $20,000. Whewwww! Didn’t realize how much value I was holding in my hands! They WERE real. Any way, she gives me another hug, thanks me over and over, and pulls out her wallet. I told her she didn’t have to give me anything and that I was happy she had them back. She handed me $120 and said that she would give me more if she wasn’t traveling, but felt like she needed to compensate me in some way for doing the right thing.   I left with a big smile on my face and $120 richer. I also felt like a really good person 😂 My fiancé was super proud of me and sad that he even entertained the idea of keeping them. He told me that I taught him something that day. It was such a sweet thing. Felt like a Hallmark movie in real life! I’ll never forget it! ❤️ [end]
[start] Good job! Have a Gold!   I’d have done exactly the same thing. In Japan I found a ¥10,000 note on the ground once outside a store. Picked it up and kept it. The next day I accidentally taped over an audio recording I’d made earlier which was too bad. Wife told me the universe has to stay in balance. If you have a big luck you have to lose something else to balance it out. So maybe if I’d given the money to the store I’d not have lost the recording. [end]
[start] My dumb conscience would probably make me return it, unfortunately.   You did the right thing! Let me buy you an iced tea! [end]
[start] I'm so glad you found it in yourself to look up when you had started looking down. [end]
[start] This reminds me of the time when I was visiting Bucharest on new year's eve last year. My friend and I were walking to the city centre for the celebration and found cash (around $500 in local currency) scattered on the footpath leading to a pharmacy. We had been walking for a while until I realized I was walking on cash lol. The pharmacy and other stores were already closed so we collected all the notes we could find, and slipped them in the pharmacy's mailbox with a note on where we found them. We figured that maybe one of the shopkeepers were in a hurry and lost them while rushing for the new year's celebration.   I am in the belief that something isn't mine just because I found them. I feel that when that happens, I have the moral obligation to return them to the rightful owner or authority.   You did the right thing OP, that was a lot of money and you fought off the the temptation to keep it to help ease the burden off someone. I hope that the $4000 you found and returned would come back in ways of having ease in all your affairs and to always be surrounded by companies who mean well and have your best interests at heart :) [end]
[start] Be careful! These can be counterfeit or marked money (i.e. their serials are recorded). Like you know some gangster disposed of them before arrest. If you plan to use them, then do that while hiding your face and having no smartphone on yourself. Since law enforcement can easily track down the anonymous buyer to the phone he/she carries. Of course use them in small quantities, while paying to people who have no way to check banknote serials.  I.e. don't insert them into ATM or expose them at Walmart. [end]
[start] I am a firm believer in karma - which, I know many who say that’s naive. Despite being agnostic, I grew up with deeply religious parents that instilled the idea that I shouldn’t touch what isn’t mine - so, the guilt would’ve definitely eaten me alive (also, I mean - I try to put myself in other’s shoes).  However, I have the memory of a fucking goldfish and have misplaced valuable things *multiple* times - to the point where it’s not even funny anymore. However - without fail - I have gotten my items returned to me *every single time.*   Everyone always remarks how unbelievable it is - but at this point I truly believe it’s because I am always finding other people’s stuff. I’ve found 1k, credit cards, wallets, multiple iPhones, iPads, a MacBook, etc. and I’ve always given it back or to a lost and found. What comes around, goes around imo and even if it is naive and someone else just ends up taking it then it’s their bad karma not mine.   - however, I also have friends who’ve found money or tech and have taken it (with zero judgement from me) and nada. I just feel like my cycle is set lol and I don’t want to disrupt it [end]
[start] Honestly, it would be a literal coin flip for me. Do as fate decides and don't look back. My reasoning for this is that the situation could be the result of an innocent (and extremely unfortunate) mistake or some crooked scum lost their ill-gotten gains. The latter I'd consider because drug dealers come to mind when talking about large sums of small bills. It seems like too much to be somebodies rent or similar. If it was 2 grand or less I'd return it without question but that amount just seems a little suspect to me. Of course, in this situation I'd be wrong but I wouldn't ever find that out if my coin came up heads. [end]
[start] 4 grand and if it's near a Walmart then I know someone just got their paycheck or is making a money order which'll be used for rent. I would probably do what you did. /r/povertyfinance commends you rando citizen. [end]
[start] As soon as read the title, I knew you had given it back.  Because for some reason people are unable to do a good deed without bragging about it. [end]
[start] Return it, of course. My mom didn't raise me to steal. [end]
[start] Some guy sent me rent on Venmo one time. His landlord had the same name as me.   I briefly considered keeping it, but I sent it back. I had no idea of this person’s financial position. The mistake could literally evict him or ruin him financially. I didn’t want that to happen to someone.  And it’s not like I desperately needed the money. [end]
[start] 20 bucks is one thing but 4000 is someone's rent and bills. You did the right thing dude! [end]
[start] I just want to say that the world needs more people like you, OP. You are the best, to think of how that man felt, missing that money that likely was for his rent, food, and medicine, and to get something for his granddaughter. A lot of older people don't trust banks, and carry cash. For you to return it, I'm sure you made him the happiest man in the world!   I truly believe in "what goes around comes around" and "what you dish out is what you get back". You may not see it for years.... but someday, you'll see that good deed returned to you, not necessarily in a way you expect either.   I try to do good things for people, just to show there's still good and kindness in the world, and it don't have to cost money either. My hope is that it inspires them to do the same, and maybe one day someone will do the same for me, so the cycle continues.   My hope is that reading your story here inspires others to do the same -  be that better person like you aspired to be when you gave that money back... and pass along that people are still good and kind. [end]
[start] By that one act of responsibility you will gain more than you would have with those $4000. It’s    a universal law. Thank you for returning it ☺️! [end]
[start] Good call. For some people, losing that much money could break them. You did good OP [end]
[start] Good on you. The good karma will come back 10x. Just wait. [end]
[start] If you kept it, it would haunt you every. single. day. for the rest of your life. You did the right thing. [end]
[start] Good karma is definitely coming your way ❤️ [end]
[start] 1) if you return it, that is the right thing to do. We’re it me I would spot you some for your honesty.  2) you can keep it and spend it but you fuck someone else over and you know Karma would get your ass somehow. I don’t want that evil on me. [end]
[start] It really says a lot about your character and you should be proud of who you are. That 4K can be made and spent so easily but understanding the impact it might have on someone else is exactly what we need in a time where everyone is so selfish and shitty. I applaud you. [end]
[start] This will change you.   I’m serious. I don’t know how to put this without coming off silly.  Proving something to yourself is impossibly hard. You always have doubts that you may not express or can even put your finger in, but they’re there.   You’ve just proven to yourself that you’re a good person at heart. That will change how you approach decisions you make in the future. [end]
[start] One time, I bought two cases of beer at Walmart. When I was checking out, I noticed along with everything else I bought at the time, the total amount was a little low. Right then and there I had a hunch the cashier did not scan the second case of beer. I shrugged and went home, and figured if she did miss it, it's the companies fault, plus it's Walmart... I don't think a missing case of beer is going to mean much to them.  So I get home, check the receipt and sure enough, only one case of beer was scanned. I felt like I had gotten away with it... for about 20 seconds. And then immense guilt started to set it. I called my parents, asked them what I should do haha. After mulling it over for about 30 minutes, I drove back, with the second case of beer, and the receipt,  and waited in line at customer services in Walmart (everyone's absolute favorite place to be, of course.)  I finally got up to a customer service rep and said, " About an hour ago, I purchased two cases of beer, and only one was scanned, I would like to pay for the second case of beer." The associate, an old man, rolled his eyes at me, scanned the beer and said the amount that was owed for it. He was a jerk, and for second I did feel like I guess trying to be a honest, good person doesn't really matter in this particular case, but none the less, I paid, got the receipt and left. I did feel like an idiot to be honest, after words. But looking back at it now, it really was the correct thing to do.   I know it's not the same thing exactly OP, but you did the right thing absolutely. There's an old reddit saying, "Today you, tomorrow me." [end]
[start] It was a trap anyways [end]
[start] I'd also really have the temptation to keep it, but you gotta return it. If you lost money then you'd also hope that you'd get it back, right? [end]
[start] Good job, this behavior is contagious so I’m glad you shared it. You definitely put something on my mind if I ever have to be in that situation. $4000 is a lot to lose so I personally couldn’t see myself taking it without trying to find the owner. $1-$200 I’ll keep but after that, it wouldn’t sit right with me to keep it. [end]
[start] Kudos to you. I don’t know what your current life situation is like, good or bad, I know that $4000 is a good amount of money to make some good changes in your life. I understand the feeling of wanting to use it so badly to give yourself a break from some responsibilities guilt free, but you did the right thing. [end]
[start] Guilt would consume me 100% and I wouldn’t last 10 minutes.  I’d be thinking about it for the rest of my life otherwise lol. [end]
[start] you are not like other walmart customers [end]
[start] I work surveillance at a casino. I can’t tell you how many times we have reports of people losing or having large amounts of money stolen due to carelessness. A lot of times, we end up seeing the moment when the person drops money or has it stolen and we often are able to identify the person or find them still in the casino.   You would be surprised how often people (scumbags) deny taking or finding the money, even when they know we have video evidence.   I commend you. I’m not sure how good Wal-Mart’s cameras are, but you are in the minority (from my experience) for retuning the money without being compelled! [end]
[start] Yeah $10 is one thing. $4000? That's somebody potentially going homeless [end]
[start] Golden rule: do unto others how you’d prefer they do unto you (or something like that). It’s honestly sad to me that people were surprised, but regardless, that’s so cool of you. [end]
[start] What somebody else already said and what I always say and do: put myself in other person's shoes. Imagine not obtaining that amount of money, but losing it. How scared or broken would you be? You of course need that money, there isn't even a small possibility that somebody just threw it away, right?  You made the righteous call and the best decision by checking if somebody lost it. If you kept it, you would probably just keep it somewhere and think how you have that much money, but would probably start being eaten away by guilt.   This was a great choice and shows your great humanity. Thank you for being a decent and kind human being. [end]
[start] I think if you find £10 ($) on the floor and it's clearly not just been dropped by someone then it's probably ok to take it. $4000 is way too much money for it not to be a big deal to someone. I'd definitely hand it in. [end]
[start] Honestly though whats the guy doing walking around with 4k in cash and then LOSING it?! [end]
[start] That's the correct answer...had they caught you on camera (and for that amount of cash, they may have eventually) that would be a felony. [end]
[start] You are an awesome human being.    I lost my rent money in the parking lot of firehouse subs because it was in my lap at the time and I just stood up from my driver's seat wanting those subs.  I didn't realize it until I had almost gotten to work.  I was so pissed off I almost didn't double back because I just knew it was gone.  I had lost that money.  I asked the store and a lady had found it and left her number.  She said "I figured someone was missing it this close to the holidays".    You did an awesome thing.  Thank you. [end]
[start] Thank you for making the world a less shitty place...genuinely, I’m certain it meant the world to that guy. [end]
[start] I'd would do exactly the same thing, even the excitement and checking my rearview as you did. Then return it, good job OP right on for returning that gentleman's money. [end]
[start] I would return $4k because I know that is a lot of money for some people and I wouldn’t want to waste half a second thinking about the trouble keeping it would have caused.    Now if I found a bag with a million dollars in it, I’m keeping it and burying it. [end]
[start] Hey this happened to me once and I ended up winning a text to win radio contest that sent me and a friend to the 2015 Grammy’s in Los Angeles! We made a whole trip of it, karma is a thing. [end]
[start] Same thing happened to me at a Home Depot. Someone left a wallet with $600 in it in the bathroom sitting on top of the toilet paper holder. I didn’t turn it in because I was afraid someone else might steal it but had them announce over the speaker the name of the person from their license.   Turns out they had been saving to buy a new front door and lost their wallet and was freaking out. My son was 6 at the time and he got to return it to them and he was so proud of himself it was adorable. He wouldn’t accept any reward money. [end]
[start] I had a similar occurrence as a teenager. I was riding in the car with my mom and was absently staring out the passenger window when I saw a bill blowing alongside the road. I told her to stop so I could jump out and grab it and proceeded to find several other bills totaling a little over $500 usd. I was ecstatic thinking of all the things that money would do for a 14 year old, and was therefore disappointed when my mom said that we were heading to the police station to turn it in. I understood the thought, but this was CASH that I found in a fairly rural area, so it seemed unlikely that someone would claim it. Anyway, flash forward 3 months when my dad barged in to my room demanding to know what I had done because some police sergeant was calling for me personally. After almost shitting myself I realized that he was telling me to come in and pickup “unclaimed property” under my name. An hour later I had $500 cash and had learned an excellent lesson. Sometimes doing the right thing works out in your favor. Usually it doesn’t come with a financial inducement, but it always comes with peace of mind. Thanks Mom! [end]
[start] This sounds right. It's nice to think about coming up on that kind of free cash, but you can't escape the fact that that windfall of yours is directly inversely correlated to someone else's day.   I think im situations like this, the relative value of the cash is important. What if it belongs to a mom and her 2 kids, living in their car while she takes every shift they can at Walmart, saving up for a security deposit and first month's rent? What if it belonged to the richest guy in town, who wouldn't even notice it was missing?  Unless you know it's the latter, I think it would weigh too heavy on me that, as someone with a decent job, who could come up with $4k if i needed to, that is likely the person who lost it needed it more than i did. [end]
[start] If I had kept it I would always wonder who had lost it and what terrible consequences it could have on their lives and the lives of their family. Was it their rent money? Their life savings? Could it be related to their work? Could they lose their job or be accused of theft?   If I didn't try to find out who lost it the part of me that believes that I'm a good person would be irreparably damaged. I wouldn't like the person  looking back at me in the mirror. My dignity and self-respect mean more to me than a fistful of money.  You did the right thing. At the end of our lives these will be the memories we're happiest about. [end]
[start] Anyone walking around with 4 grand in a variety of bills obviously saved it and likely desperately needs it. The guilt of keeping it would absolutely destroy me, I’ve been where that person is and the panic of losing that much hard-saved money would be crippling. I can actually feel it rising in my chest just imagining it. Egad this is an anxiety inducing hypothetical, haha. [end]
[start] You are what they call a “good human”  you should sleep well [end]
[start] Wow nice moral fiber you showed there! Bravo on doing the right thing! [end]
[start] When my daughter was 10, she did a lot of chores to have spending money for vacation. Somewhere between the car and the store, she lost the twenty dollar bill out of her pocket. (Many years ago, so $20 was a lot of money. When she got to the cash register line, the kid in front of her was going on about how lucky she was to find money in the parking lot, coincidentally paying with a much crumbled $20 bill. It was only after the girl left with her parent who was with her the whole time that my daughter discovered the money had fallen out of her pocket. The amount doesn’t matter, it’s the principle that counts. [end]
[start] if it was 100$ id keep it, but being $4000... i probably would have called the store to return it too..  after driving home checking my rear view as as well. [end]
[start] If there was someone searching for it, yeah, I'd return it. But $4k in a Walmart parking lot, and I'd assume it's drug money. [end]
[start] I did the same thing a few years ago.. I wish I had kept the money because now my life sucks and I’m fucking broke but that’s what happens when you do nice stuff for good karma!! [end]
[start] 💚💙You passed the test and have graduated to ascension. In the past, you would have, for you have learned to love. Expect great abundance to be coming your way💙💚 [end]
[start] I would 100 percent return it because I know the feeling of having lost that kind of amount. You did good, OP. Karma will be kind in some way, I am sure. [end]
[start] Damn... I lost a wallet with my ID , debit card and 100 cash and i never got anything back i still am upset about it. So you are the nicest person ever. $4k its such a temptation but u didnt give in. [end]
[start] You obviously didn't need the money, I could use 4k to feed myself for a while, being unemployed and not available for unemployment. [end]
[start] I returned some guys wallet with 170$. I didn’t have to, but it was eating away at me. I think that returning the money is the right thing to do regardless of the amount. Although it probably feels like giving away a winning lottery ticket, it’s not worth having a guilty conscience over.   And who knows, it might come full circle.😉   You did the right thing! [end]
[start] When I picture myself in that situation I always think “I’d definitely keep the money!” but the only time something of the sorts happened to me I gave the money back [end]
[start] Once i found 1500 bucks in my office parking lot and i have handed it over to security staff. Either they can return it to owner or they might keep it. Either ways it works fine ! [end]
[start] Honestly, Id feel super guilty about it. But I wouldnt return it. And while i know "you dont know until it happens" and "gosh what a terrible person you must be" and maybe youre right. But right now i would need that 4k just to keep eating, fix my transmission, and be able to be just a little better off living in a van in a walmart parking lot. [end]
[start] Take the money and run away to a cabin or a lake [end]
[start] Karmas real so id return that ahahah [end]
[start] My dad owns a small business and keeps his money for the week in one of those blue bankers bag, one day he dropped that bag at a frys parking lot, he had about 12,000 in cash, another 5300 in checks and money orders (not everyone pays him cash) and he happened to have a couple of his business cards in there. 4 days after he lost it someone showed up to his office and handed it to him, my dad was shocked that not one single dollar was missing. He ended up giving the guy $100 for gas and his time and about 2 months later he ended up doing his immigration paperwork for him for free [end]
[start] /r/thathappened [end]
[start] These are the decisions that shape and mold our character. $4000 is not a fair price for your soul. No doubt this is and will always be a defining moment in your life. You’ve shown THIS is who you are. [end]
[start] Karma FACTS 💯💯 well done [end]
[start] I’m proud of you. [end]
[start] Listen to those people who are telling you you will be blessed.  You'll know it when it happens. [end]
[start] Seeing that amount of money I would try to justify it as maybe it was a drug dealers money but I really don’t know what I would do.. I hope I would do the right thing.. [end]
[start] >What would you do?  Put it in my emergency fund. [end]
[start] If I found $3000 at walmart i could give it back [end]
[start] The thing is, eternal peace of mind is worth more than money.  Good for you for realizing that on some level. [end]
[start] Honestly if you don’t get 4k upvotes for that act of kindness. [end]
[start] I'd so badly want to keep it... But if I did keep it and be sure to mention I could have been an asshole and kept it and reminded them they nobody needs to walk around with that much cash [end]
[start] Grandpa’s a drug dealer. [end]
[start] He was there getting a money order [end]
[start] I once found a $20 bill on the airport some years ago. I kept it, but if the quantity was bigger, then I would return it. [end]
[start] Thank you for being so incredibly honest and kind.   You probably also taught the granddaughter a great lesson by example. [end]
[start] I would've taken 15% off the top AND THEN returned it. Call it a finder's fee. [end]
[start] I would probably return it out of guilt, if it was $50 dollars or less then maybe not. If someone is gonna loose less than $50 the chances are that it doesn’t matter too much to them. But I think anything over that is enough money to have a large impact on someone’s life. [end]
[start] Honestly I would have thought it was a drug dealers or something. Who walk around with £4K apart from criminals? [end]
[start] You did the right thing but on the other hand who walks around with SO MUCH CASH?! [end]
[start] I would definitely ask if someone lost it & if they could tell me how much they lost, I would turn it over to them.   I lost my first mortgage payment at a restaurant 20 years ago. I had withdrawn it from one bank on my lunch with intent to deposit it in another bank on my way home from work. ( 2nd bank was to far from my job to do at lunch time). I went in restaurant & hung my purse on the chair.  Walked out forgetting my purse.  Got back to my job & realized no purse.  Literally ran out of work, got in car , drive to restaurant & no purse on the chair.   Went to the counter & asked there.  Nope no one had seen it BUT the table had been cleaned up.  Ran in the bathroom & found my purse dumped in a stall.  Everything there but my money 😢 That start a whole domino effect of problems. Took forever to get straightened out. Nearly a year.  Lesson learned.  Purse stays on my lap at restaurants ever since & never a large sum of money in cash in my purse since. [end]
[start] You definitely did the right thing here [end]
[start] I would never return it to the store. You calling to ask was the best idea. I use to work for a super market, and would give money to the front desk I found while working in the lot. They just added it to the safe/kept it themselves, even when I was told I'd get it if no one claimed it after a few days. We're only taking like $20 at most in this instance. [end]
[start] I’m so proud of you. You’re a great person. I would do the same 💕 [end]
[start] I would have returned it too, you have no idea what you’ve done for that man today but it may have been life changing. Thinking of all the possibilities of what it could have been used for would suck all enjoyment out of anything I’d wanted to buy [end]
[start] returning it is probably the best thing one could do. [end]
[start] Why is Walmart the place to find cash? Speaking from past experience and anecdotes but never encountered anything more than $10 [end]
[start] It depends on whether or not $4000 would make a difference in my life. [end]
[start] I’d return it even though I’ve been the one who lost money that was not returned... stinks being the bigger person sometimes but you did the right thing. [end]
[start] I'd keep it [end]
[start] Good job. You just earned yourself some good karma.  It would be different if it was a $20 bill. I would have done the same and then hoped no one was looking for it   The guilt would eat me alive if I didn’t.  I am happy they’re are good people.  Most people are I believe it’s just the shitty ones make so much more of their presence known [end]
[start] I think you made the right call by checking with Walmart. If they had said no one was missing anything... Then that'd be another story [end]
[start] i would have called and asked if anyone had lost anything in the parking lot/store. i wouldn't have said money, and I'd have made them tell me what was lost, not the other way around. less chance an employee just keeps it that way. make them tell you what you found, not vice versa. if they could do that, I'd return it. if they couldn't tell me what and how much, it's mine. I've worked with too many shitty people who would absolutely say "oh yeah someone did lose money I'll take it and call them to come get it." only to pocket the money themselves. [end]
[start] Good for you. I know kudos from internet strangers probably doesn't compare to having 4000 but just remember that that was probably someone's life savings and putting yourself in their shoes and feeling empathy for them makes you a more positive person in your own eyes and for society.  There's a lot of unkindness in the world. So if you can be kind, then be kind. [end]
[start] I was at Walmart trying to put my check onto my prepaid card. The woman was having a tough time putting onto my card, she said screw it and just cashed the check and gave me cash. I left the store, and something told me to check my account, just to make sure. Sure enough, $950 was sitting in my account. But I had the cash too......i went right back into that store, and gave it to the manager after explaining what happened. I didn't want that bad karma coming after me but most importantly, i didn't want HER to lose her job. I had just become homeless with my children also at that time so I really needed the extra but I just couldn't keep it. Oh, and the manager also gave me a $100 walmart gift card for returning the money. [end]
[start] High honor Arthur [end]
[start] Yeah I would of took it. Good for you for having a pure heart though [end]
[start] I’ve found cash in the mall parking lot. Couldn’t have been more that $60, but still, it wasn’t mine. I turned it in at customer service in the mall and thought I would be blessed with good karma... false lol [end]
[start] Well done OP.  You will not regret this. [end]
[start] Give it back because it’s the right thing to do :) [end]
[start] Im happy you returned it but also how does someone drop a heap of money ! Maybe he only does cash and wont / cant open a bank account [end]
[start] I'd take about 200 of it and leave the rest. I could use the cash but no need to take it all. I feel guilty easily so this is probably all I'd do [end]
[start] If it was a smaller amount I’d keep it, but that amount lost is life ruining for a lot of people so I couldn’t keep it [end]
[start] Who brings 4000 in cash to a dam Wal-Mart? I would have kept it assuming someone unsavory had dropped it. [end]
[start] Sometimes we are teated in ways we will never know. You acted admirably and have honor. I don’t know one republican that would’ve done the same. [end]
[start] I found 1200 in a theater I worked in once, I understand it was my job, but I was alone and it would be just as easy to have gotten away with it as if I wasn’t working. My immediate thought was “someone carrying this much money is MOST LIKELY” trying to lay rent, or something important.” I found out later that it was indeed someone’s rent and they had broken down when they figured out they lost it. Of course the thought crossed my mind to keep it. But there’s no way I could’ve done that knowing someone out there might be suffering for it. That being said, everyone always double check your pockets before leaving anywhere you’ve been ha. You’ll be surprised by the amount of times I’ve found a wallet with a lot of money in it in a theater. [end]
[start] I found a $100 sitting at an ATM machine in a coffee shop. I left my name and phone number in case someone came in looking for it. After a few days no one came, so I went to the bank and left the money with them and my info. I figured they would just look at the camera and match up the last person that went to the machine and put it in their account. $100 is a lot of money for some people.  Turns out the bank didn't care enough to do that, and they called me back and I could have that $100, on the way to the bank I got a flat tire, so the $100 helped pay for the flat tire I got in trying to do the right thing. [end]
[start] Put it away and use some for shopping for my family. What you did was good and hopefully it got returned tot he right people. I lost about $250 years ago in a movie theater and I hope someone hard working found it and put it to good use. It sucks losing money but it’s always nice to find it. [end]
[start] Good on you, it was the right thing to do. [end]
[start] Dude I lost 20 last week and I was miserable.  Good on you for doing the right thing. [end]
[start] I found about $150 at Kroger the other week. Right outside by my car in the parking lot when i finished shopping. I took it and sat in my car for a bit to see if anyone walked by looking for something. Noone came after a few min, so i kept it. [end]
[start] Great job. The best thing you could've done. You will be blessed with more, i promise you. [end]
[start] Return the 3k I just found laying there [end]
[start] I am a chronic wallet loser and I'm shocked at how many times people have gone out of their way to get it back to me. Even mailing it to my address with me having no way of knowing who sent it and no way to thank them. People are mostly good. [end]
[start] good that you need to return, but old guy needs to use a credit card and keep his cash in a bank.   this is why you dont carry cash. also people can just legally steal it without any charges and there are issues with this. Its called 'civil asset forfeiture'. Do not carry around large amounts of cash. use a bank. its insured by the FDIC. [end]
[start] 4k isn't life changing to me. But it could have been for the people that lost it.  My main concern would have been if it was drug money. [end]
[start] Wow finding that would mean paying off my credit debts. I really don’t know what I’d do if that happened to me. [end]
[start] You did great friend! $20 bill, I think you can call it luck if no obvious solution is apparent. But thousands of dollars, that could be absolutely life altering for someone. You have to try to get that back for them. [end]
[start] I once had a $20 bill in the back pocket of my ripped jeans. Must have slipped out and fell next to me as I was pumping gas. I looked down and saw it, turned it in to the store clerk. I got home and realized that it was my own $20 bill I just gave away. I was too embarrassed to go back and claim it. [end]
[start] "Hey, I found your thousand dollars!" [end]
[start] I would have figured that anyone that is carrying that much cash and is careless enough to lose it in a WalMart parking lot was probably a criminal. Would have absolutely kept it. [end]
[start] You did the moral thing. Someone experienced the same happiness you felt. I wouldn’t blame you for keeping it, but I think you did the kind thing [end]
[start] It's already been proven that the more money someone finds the less likely they are to keep it. [end]
[start] Not a great idea to be hauling that much physical cash in the first place but good on you for doing the right thing. [end]
[start] Woulda have kept that shit. I would have seen it as winning the lottery. [end]
[start] I'd return 3,5k [end]
[start] Keeping the 4k would only be okay in my mind after you spend all the time and effort you can afford to try and find it's owner. If no owner then can be found, then reluctantly you can keep it.. but it never feels like its yours.. [end]
[start] LPT if you have a lot of cash on you fucking pay attention to it. [end]
[start] Cheers for returning it, people like you help cancel out the shithead that found my wife’s wedding ring and neglected to try and return it. [end]
[start] Thank you for doing the right thing. Times are tough for everyone and I'm sure it wasn't easy. [end]
[start] I would’ve returned $3000 and been like that’s all I found 🤷‍♂️ [end]
[start] Definitely return it. You lose nothing. It wasn’t yours. Good job. People kill themselves over far, far, far less. [end]
[start] First I would like to say that I am proud of you for doing that. Many people would not have made an effort to find whose money it is.   My thought process in the situation:  I am either going to take the money but then later on in life feel bad about it because I would carelessly use that money to feed my wants.   I am going to do exactly what you did which will cause me to tell myself that I have to earn my money rather than being happy with someone else's. I would also be hurt if I lost that amount of money. [end]
[start] I would have waited for John Quinones to come out for about two minutes and then kept it. It’s all how you interpret what the universe is telling you.   For all I know, the guy who lost it was about to buy supplies to bury a body. Just saying... [end]
[start] As someone who’s both forgot their purse in a parking lot and found a wallet in a parking lot, I could personally only do one thing - return it. That utter horror you feel when you lose or forget something is terrible. I couldn’t live with myself if I found someone’s cash, purse or wallet and didn’t return it. I’m glad you returned the cash you found. I’m sure the owner was super relieved and appreciative.  I’ve often wondered though about a “cut-off” amount. Like, if I find $5 or $10 on the ground, I’m not gonna try to find out who it belongs to. But at what amount does one decide the owner should be found? [end]
[start] Integrity = Doing the right thing when nobody’s looking ! Need more people like you . Good Karma will come . God bless you! [end]
[start] Ir that happens to me today, at this very moment, I would keep it. I know, I know... But this times are shittier than ever and as we say "money don't have name" [end]
[start] This is the way. [end]
[start] I mean, to me it's no different than seeing a car with the keys in it or finding the same cash in a wallet. It's not yours and just because someone else is being careless or had an accident doesn't change that. Stealing is stealing. I'm glad you returned it but honestly am kind of grossed out that people would be surprised or impressed. [end]
[start] I found a credit card in a folded over envelope (almost like a makeshift wallet..) at Walmart just a week ago.  I picked it up, looked for the nearest worker and told them someone dropped it and they knew exactly who it was because that person had just come to them frantically looking for it probably a few minutes earlier.    But the point is I didn't think much about keeping it.  I had no feelings like you did with the cash.  Because it was a card...it could have had thousands of dollars in the account.  But I didn't see it in my hand like cash.  If I saw a wad of cash though...it would have been a totally different feeling.  I probably would have hesitated and thought about keeping it. [end]
[start] If it was 20 bucks, I’d keep it. But knowing how I’d feel if I lost that amount of money, I could never keep it [end]
[start] I'm so very proud of you. I can't imagine the temptation. I know I would have struggled, too.  You did good in the world. [end]
[start] Honestly in this case it was the right thing to do. $4k ain’t shit these days. Better to give it back. If it were $400k that would be a different story. [end]
[start] Found a beautiful wedding ring in an* airplane bathroom once on my way to Hawaii. Thought about keeping it for a hot second, then they came on the intercom asking if anyone found one. I returned it to the newlywed and got free drinks all the way. [end]
[start] I've always told myself. If I ever lose my wallet, and its got a hundred or so dollars in it, I don't care anyone takes the money, so long as I get my wallet back. [end]
[start] While I’d like to say I’m better than that, honestly I don’t think I am. I’m pretty sure I would’ve kept it. In the moment, I’m pretty sure all I’d be thinking about is how much that would help me. However I’d be scared to death of karma. Props to you all who would return it though [end]
[start] I would return it unless I was somehow 100% sure it didn’t belong to someone who needed it. If I knew for certain it belonged to some big company that wouldn’t miss it then for sure I’m keeping it fuck em [end]
[start] As much as 4k would change my life in a big way, I would keep it.  I need my teeth and my car fixed bad.  If would also probably assume it was there because of a drug deal fuck up. [end]
[start] I have struggled with guilt my entire life. If I kept and spent that money it would seriously haunt me.   I grew up poor we didn’t have anything when we were kids and my parents had to work multiple jobs to pay the bills. I found a wallet in the hallway of my apartment once. I took $40 from the money that was in there. I was so young I don’t even remember how much it was.  We didn’t get a lot of treats, so I spent it on candy and things that we never got to enjoy. I gave the wallet back to the building manager to return to the own. I still think about that money and feel bad and that was honestly 23ish years ago now.   I think you did the right thing and you know that too!! [end]
[start] I turned a cigarette pack with cash in to police lost and found department as a kid. They were surprised but glad.  After a few months I got the money [end]
[start] I would have kept it. Cause I'm a prick. This world doesn't stop for anyone, so take your pick. Besides, how can you LOSE four THOUSAND dollars?! [end]
[start] Something something brain tumor. [end]
[start] I'd wait around the place the money was lost and see who lost it [end]
[start] I even drove over 150 miles to return a lost wallet(had a lot of money in it) I found on the road..called the guy (has a phn number inside) he said he can’t come to take back the wallet as someone in the family not well so I took his address and drove straight to return the wallet.good deeds never get wasted....someone returned mine as well after few years...had my important ids in it. [end]
[start] I know the side effect of saying this but.. I would have kept it [end]
[start] If you took it that would be the crime of “theft by finding” [end]
[start] Keep it. Not my problem, just my lucky day. If it happened to me then that's my bad, I don't expect anyone to return the favour for me. "The right thing to do" doesn't get you anywhere. End of the day you're $4,000 poorer than you could have been. [end]
[start] I lost over $100 one time, and that was enough to bring me to a point where I was suicidal for a while. Especially now, who knows what people are going through, and what that kind of loss would do to them. Thank you for returning it. [end]
[start] I took this test before. You did what I did, which was the right thing.  Sleep well knowing you're a good person. [end]
[start] I'm not a very spiritual person but I do believe in some idea of karma or something about the energy you put out is the energy that you'll receive or whatever. I've been kind and giving and was treated with great kindness. On the same token, I've done horrible things to people and have yet to feel the consequences. I've found someone in my life that I hope to love and cherish forever so I'm trying to dish out my absolute best to not have to feel them ever. [end]
[start] 4K? Sure, give it back...but would you feel *as* guilty if you’d found 400K in a steel briefcase? [end]
[start] I would’ve kept it. Morality is relative. You played yourself.   On a serious note, you played yourself. Morality is relative.  Seriously though. That takes a lot of will power. Impressive. [end]
[start] Most people would keep it, sadly. I've known of horrid humans who find dogs and resell them on Craigslist, without ever giving the opportunity of the real owners to find them. That's for mere $100 or $200...it's heartbreaking!   Good for you! Hope they invited you a burger or something! [end]
[start] I work at a bank and this is exactly why we discourage people from taking out large amounts in cash, too easy to lose/be stolen. [end]
[start] $4000 isn’t the kind of money that is life changing for me to find, but would be a really big deal if I lost that amount of money  on the other hand, if I come across a few hundred thousand dollars, that would be life changing; and the entity that mishandled that amount of money would certainly have some type of coverage for such a huge loss [end]
[start] " its mine" [end]
[start] Better you than the cops, that money has no presumption of innocence! [end]
[start] I'm sorry for saying this but I would have taken the money. Low risk high reward. [end]
[start] I would have returned it. If it's not my money, it's not mine and I can't get any joy from it. Let alone knowing the pain that someone else will be going through for having lost it. [end]
[start] Absolutely return it. You would always feel guilty about it.   Thank you for doing that. [end]
[start] When I was a child my mom and I went to the bank to drop off a envelope of money. In the envelope was our rent, bill and food money. I was really poor growing up. Before the bank we stopped at a few stores to grab somethings. Sometime during that, the envelope of money fell out of the car. My mom was distraught. We searched everywhere. She had multiple break downs before going home to tell my dad she had lost all of the money we had. When we got home it was really bad. So bad it still scars me to this day. I remember crying in my room thinking “how could someone pick up money and not return it.”  The money was never returned but that memory is still strong in my mind. I’ve found things throughout my life and go out of my way to return them to their rightful owner. What you did was sooooo good. [end]
[start] My dad found a wallet that had been run over on the side of the road  I don't think there was a licence or anything in there, there was only a few dollars so the poor dude must've been jumped :( [end]
[start] And then everybody clapped [end]
[start] You’re a good person. There is no worth in a guilty conscience. [end]
[start] I've had my wallet returned so many times I could never keep someone else's. [end]
[start] i probably give it back bc my first thought was that it might be someone’s rent): or money for bills and with all this stuff going on rn ik it’s tough as fuck to bounce back after losing a shit load of money like that [end]
[start] You did the right thing and it will (or should) make you feel good for years. Far more valuable than a cool TV that makes you feel like shit every time you think about it too hard.    You made the right decision for them AND for you. Nicely done. [end]
[start] I too have found a ^(fuck) ton of money in an envelope in a parking lot. However, my brain immediately thought that it was drug money and that I was most definitely being watched. I frantically ran the envelope into the cashier saying "i found a lot of money" and ran back to my car and skrrted outta there as fast as I could. In the moment I thought I had intercepted a great drug deal and I was going to pay for it with my life.. In hindsight, I clearly dont know how drug deals actually go down lol. Either way, I should've spared a second and left my phone number with the cashier when she asked for it.  People always say Im a saint for turning it in whenever I tell this story, but I always correct them that I was simply scared shitless. So yea, Ill be the first to say that your brain can do some crazy stuff to ya. we humans are weird [end]
[start] Honestly, I'd go through the same things you went through with the $4000. Take it with full intention of keeping it and then return it. [end]
[start] Good job man [end]
[start] one movie that taught me to never steal money was No Country for Old Men [end]
[start] Same. [end]
[start] I would keep it [end]
[start] You did the right thing. You never know who's money that could be. It may be someone you really don't want to fuck with. [end]
[start] Same thing happened to me. I wish I could say it was my superior morals that made me turn it in, but it was actually my friend who was with me. I'm not sure exactly how much it was, but it was at least a couple thousand. It was at a gas station and almost as soon as I went back inside and handed it in, a woman ran in frantically. Looking back all these years later, I'm glad I did the right thing, even if I had to be pushed to do so [end]
[start] But like if you ask ANYONE hey I found some money is it yours? They are more likely to probably sway 'yes' [end]
[start] So grandpa complained to walmart that he lost 4k in a parking lot?  ....lol hrm...sorry but thats on you.   Maybe that was karma for you. Or who knows. [end]
[start] Id keep it and gp buy meth then hopefully die later that day too [end]
[start] Yay gj man [end]
[start] Funny how they say you were blessed, no you did a good thing, doesn't have anything to do with a higher power. You're free will you decided to do the right thing. Good job! [end]
[start] I'd just remove my curiosity by saying child trafficking or drug money. [end]
[start] take some and lie saying u found it like that, win win for everyone [end]
[start] Nah i'd keep the money but good on you. [end]
[start] Ok i’m not gonna lie, I would have definitely taken it and not brought it back. I know it’s a sucky thing to say. I guess it depends on the environment and current situation. [end]
[start] I'd keep it. I'd move away from my shitty land lord, I'd throw some money into my truck and I'd be really happy with my life, the first thing I'd do is thank god for helping me, cause I'm in a situation where I desperately need that money [end]
[start] I'm broke. So I would have kept it. [end]
[start] You did the right thing. [end]
[start] Wow...all the people here who would try to justify keeping the cash if they'd found it. Nobody knows why the guy had that much cash on him. It was probably a very good reason. Even if it wasn't, it's still the right thing to do to return it. Good on you OP. [end]
[start] Well you lost 4k for being too nice, still good job [end]
[start] >And then it set in. I knew today was fucking awesome.  Ah, fixed it for you. 😗  Bit late for you though. ._.  [🚶🎵🎶](https://youtu.be/d-diB65scQU)   >I always said that if it happened to me, I'd take it. If I found a bunch of money somewhere, I'd take it. But you don't know until it actually happens.  Speak for yourself.  I know I'd take it, and never feel any kind a way but awesome. 😊 I like money.💰 👀  😳 [end]
[start] I would have kept it, call it a life lesson dont care cash unless your willing to lose it. 4000$ isn't a small amount of money, why would you have that on you? Debit/credit cards work everywhere I go, if your going to make a large purchase say used car something like that checks work fine.   Large sums if cash are only good for two things trying to get a deal on a used car, and buying drugs. In all cases you need to be careful where you put it. [end]
[start] Lameeeeee [end]
[start] Probably legged it on foot back home (4-8 miles for me depending on which). Then returned to pick up my vehicle with a different outfit and look. That way the can't trace back my car to me since technically this could be tried as a felony.  Remember, folk heroes gain nothing. [end]
[start] I would have kept it without a second thought ngl [end]
[start] Return it because it was a trap and probably fake money.   Who tf carries 4k on them [end]
[start] Your a asshole return it [end]
[start] Call the store to find who’s it was. Once you realize it’s a guy and his daughter, kill the guy, rape the daughter, and leave 50$ on their huddled corpses as a tip. Then leave with the rest. The weak should fear the strong 🤷‍♂️ [end]
[TITLE] Today, I've been clean from meth for a year! [TITLE]
[start] Congratulations and that's odly inspirational,  like that you didn't give up and in the end it was a happy ending [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Holy shit. Congratulations and I mean that so very sincerely. I work in a busy ER and I see soooo many good people who are addicted to drugs and unfortunately all I really see are the relapses so it’s incredible to hear a success story like yours. I want to help my addict patients so badly but I often have no clue what to say when they break down in front of me besides telling them I care about them (I really do) and I hope that they keep trying. Any advice? [end]
[start] Congratulations keep your head up. It doesn't get easier but you have to stay hard. If you ever need someone to talk to or you feel like doing it again text me. [end]
[start] Congrats!!!  It gets easier the longer you're sober, but never goes away completely.  Just make sure that you keep a good check on your mental state and go see a psych or therapist if you or your wife notice any behavioral changes.  I've been sober off meth for almost 14 years now, and started when I was 13 as well.  Having a positive relationship with mental health services and being open to seeking help when you need it is going to yield a much better path forward if you end up needing to seek treatment a few years down the road.  Stay strong and stay sober! [end]
[start] Congrats! I was addicted to meth for probably a good 8 years, quit at the same age you did. Through that period of time I also ended up addicted to heroin, used needles, lost my grip on sanity and couldn't even walk into a convenience store without damn near having a panic attack. I'm 36 now and it feels like that was a different life now. You'll get there, too. I remember how impossible it seemed to even get to a year, much less 11. You should be incredibly proud of yourself for overcoming such a terrible thing. [end]
[start] Wow!  That’s a major accomplishment, kicking one of the most addictive substances known to man. I pray that long term effects are minimal and wish you the most happiness possible for you and your family.   What you did was life changing for that little goober. I see the fallout daily from parents who don’t kick their substance abuse problems. Good luck! [end]
[start] Don’t look back Brother. Going on 23 yrs myself. Congrats! [end]
[start] Way to go! Congrats. I just hit my 6month clean and it feels amazing. [end]
[start] This story is amazing! Great fucking job my dude! Your wife must be so proud and your kid is gonna have a great life thanks to you! [end]
[start] Idk who you are man,but I'm seriously proud of you. [end]
[start] Thank you for cleaning up for yourself and especially your kid. Am ex addict with 3 year under my belt, I have a 2.5 year old and 7 month old and they're my biggest motivation for my sobriety. My mental health, which was a shit show from 11-31 years of age is now stable. The drugs don't help and I'd say after 2 years of sobriety my mental health stabilised.   Congratulations man [end]
[start] Fellow addict here, just wanted to say you kick fucking ass! Cheers sir. [end]
[start] Hey man this is awesome to hear! I haven’t ever slammed, but I can relate to addiction. It’s great that you have found refuge in family and are keeping yourself clean. Keep it up so that you can make sure your child has the best life possible.   Not many people can bounce back from methamphetamine addiction; It takes quite a resultant being.... what was your process for quitting? Did you go through rehab? Did you do it on your own? Very curious to hear methods!!! [end]
[start] Proud of you dude. Keep strong for the kid and your own happiness [end]
[start] 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🥰🥰🥰🥰😍👏🏼🙂🙂👌🏼🙌🏻👌🏼🙌🏻👌🏼🙌🏻👌🏼🙌🏻🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🎈🎈🎂👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🎂🎂🎂 [end]
[start] In 2 days, I will have 11 months off shooting heroin and meth. My life is the opposite of where I was back then. Congrats man! [end]
[start] Congrats man! Be strong for your wife and little one! Lead by example champ 😀 [end]
[start] Congratulations! Stay the course. You, your wife,  and your little goober need you ❤️🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼 [end]
[start] My sister is an addict. This gives me hope. [end]
[start] Congratulations! 🎊 [end]
[start] The delusions will go away with time. So will the anxiety and paranoia. It took me over a year to feel normal.  Eat lots of good fats = salmon and avocado are my go to.  Lifting weights and jogging helped me immensely as well [end]
[start] Congrats dude! 🎉 [end]
[start] congrats!!! ik it’s hard as fuck i have three brothers that struggle with addiction and i’ve tried it all to help them out but ya know it’s hard. hope everything continues to be good!! 🥳 [end]
[start] Congrats, also the paranoia will possibly go away after some years. Mine did eventually for the most part. [end]
[start] Really happy for you. :) [end]
[start] Good job. Happy for you.   The fight is truly worth it.   Be well. [end]
[start] Congratulations! [end]
[start] Wow congratulations! You are inspiring. Just got out of rehab a year ago; still going strong. [end]
[start] Congratulations! You should be very proud of your accomplishment. You did an exceptionably difficult thing. I’m proud of you and this post made my day.   I occasionally focus on past mistakes instead embracing my achievements so I’ll leave you with this quote, “Every morning we are born again. What we do today is what matters most.” -Buddha [end]
[start] That’s amazing and congratulations on becoming parents! It changes EVERYTHING in the BEST ways!! ❤️ 💕 [end]
[start] Excellent... Keep up the good work xx [end]
[start] Congratulations! You are a strong man [end]
[start] Because you’re proud and happy is what will carry you forward when challenged. Way to go and way to step up for your child. [end]
[start] This is awesome! My ex and I broke up recently due to his meth addiction and it was getting too scary for me and my kid. So hearing things like this is so comforting and hopeful. Congrats to you, man! This is so great! [end]
[start] I’m proud of you my dude. Getting clean is never easy, and I love seeing you trying to improve every day. Very inspiring :) [end]
[start] WELL DONE!!!!!!! [end]
[start] Yay for getting clean! I did as well, but off opioids. I know how hard it is. Make sure to keep up the work because cravings sneak up on you. But you are a rockstar for seeing your child needed a father! [end]
[start] Yay! It's always so awesome to see posts like this. I didn't have as long of a struggle and never got into shooting anything up, but I have bipolar type 1 which helped along a nasty decade of drug and alcohol abuse along with all the other fun stuff that comes with the highs and lows, including a psychotic episode that lasted months after a particularly long drug bender. I'm 16 weeks pregnant and own a home with my husband who I've known for 13 years and somehow still wanted me after watching me be a train wreck as a friend. It's so hard to be "normal". I was still drinking heavily until the day I got my positive test (at 4 weeks luckily so no harm) and I hope I can use my experiences to be an understanding and informed parent. [end]
[start] OMG that's so great!  Congrats!  Remember how strong you are when you receive new challenges-- ain't that how life is?  If you did that, you can do anything!! [end]
[start] Congrats dude! Keep at it and you'll have a great life with your family. You've got so many years ahead of you to experience the world with brand new eyes. Keep it up and live your best life. [end]
[start] I’m 6 months clean from meth and cocaine... I’m happy for you! Thanks for the hope! I had been using since I was 15 [end]
[start] Well, started my day by reading this. I’ve been clean myself for five months now and reading stories such as yours are only giving me power and hope for getting over it. Surely it’s a very difficult situation and people that have never experienced it can’t understand it fully. It takes so much time to convince yourself to cut off but all the effort could be destroyed in seconds.  I wish the best to you and your family! Keep trying my friend, life is beautiful! [end]
[start] The amazingly sad thing is, how the western civilization has loopholes so that a freakin 13 yo kid starts using all these drugs that i have not even seen. It’s a sad result of being overly civilized, I reckon. But it sounds so hopeless... guess the escapism that most of europeans are trying is not the way to go, to be happy. I’m happy for you, man. Please, never look back, even if you do, just do it as a reminder. [end]
[start] So proud of you and your wife! I wish you and your family all the happiness in the world. Don’t forget to post a year from today so we can all celebrate your 2 year anniversary with you! [end]
[start] Congrats,dude. [end]
[start] Hell yeah!! Keep doing what you're doing,  congratulations! [end]
[start] This is the first 'Ive been sober for X long" posts I have seen in a while. I wonder how yours got through the subs filter. [end]
[start] Grats bro, keep it up! [end]
[start] Congratulations OP! [end]
[start] Hey man, fuck yeah! Congrats on the year! It’s amazing how full life can become when we are clean.. best feeling in the world. Remember that all we have is a daily reprieve that’s contingent upon the maintenance of our spiritual condition. The bad days unfortunately will come, but that doesn’t mean you need to use. Keep it up brother, things will continue to get better. [end]
[start] Congrats, let's celebrate with some meth on me! [end]
[start] If you don’t mind telling me/us, how did you get married with such a (damaging as it sounds) addiction at the time? [end]
[start] That’s so amazing, so many people never come back.. congrats!!! [end]
[start] My Daughter is a recovering Heroin addict she is 3 years clean.  So I understand.  Again Good job 👍 [end]
[start] I'm late to the party. But I just got here, sorry.   I'm gonna get real with you. Skip the big paragraph if you're sensitive to stuff. This is a true story.   I once knew a man. I knew him from the age of 8, until the age of 27. I nearly married that man. I wish I had. He started young, like you. He had bouts of relative sobriety (weed n beer dont count in this story), which were pure and loving and delightful. He had bouts of mania, which were unnerving though mildly entertaining. They got decidedly less entertaining as he became more and more driven by adrenaline. He had bouts of severe relapse, which were terrifying and aggravating and disappointing. They got more frightening over time. After a DUI got him sent home from the army, he declined my assistance and chose to self "medicate" his PTSD away (LPT: it doesn't work that way). And all things being equal, he was never a picky pharmacist... He was left unsupervised for a period of several days - undoubtedly falling deeper into psychosis - broke into a gun safe, shot semi-automatic firearms indiscriminately through the house, had a stand-off with SWAT and police, and then essentially committed suicide by cop by walking out and shooting at the SWAT tank. His autopsy and a search of the house revealed near fatal doses of meth, heroin, and Everclear. He had spiraled all the way out. I couldn't help him. He wouldn't let me help him. And now he is gone.   I told you all that so I could tell you this.   GOOD FUCKING ON YA, MATE. Seriously. As the person who should have been raising children alongside a recovered addict, I am so glad that I saw your story today. And I know that you are putting in WORK to be where you are. I know you don't know me, but I am so fucking proud of you.   It's not just your kid and your wife that deserve the best version of you. YOU do too. It sounds like you've got a hold of it now and I stfg I am so happy to hear it. I will be cheering you on for years to come. Seriously I wish I could hug you. Congratulations. [end]
[start] Congrats! That’s incredible-keep it up! [end]
[start] Good for you man! Congrats on getting your life together and good luck in the future. [end]
[start] Good for you! [end]
[start] Congratulations my friend! You've fought long and hard to better yourself and overcome your obstacle. As a fellow internet stranger to another, I am proud of you. This also gives me hope that I can overcome my own issues, less severe as it may be.  I hope you continue to improve yourself and I trust you to do so! I mean, you've got a year on your belt after all. [end]
[start] Keep going! Proud of you!! [end]
[start] Right on brotha, you keep on keeping on, no matter what life throws at you, you'll handle it because you beat your own demons. [end]
[start] That’s amazing!!! Keep it up dear. Just for today! [end]
[start] Congratulations mate!!! Great Achievement.... May be you can document your story of recovery in video or an article to help many more🎁🎁🎁🎁 [end]
[start] Congrats my dude. I understand the mental torture you speak of. Keep it up. [end]
[start] High fives on making those super hard choices! My dad never stopped his meth use and he still sends me delusional texts and calls all the time, saying I’m possessed by demons and such. He’s 62 and doesn’t have a relationship with me or his grandson now. Keep up the good work and keep taking care of you! Your child deserves to have you healthy and present in their life. [end]
[start] You are only starting my friend.....this is a long haul....and all depends on how deep this feeling goes and how you react when shit gets hard.....you sound like a bad ass and I wish you all the best......you got this 😘 [end]
[start] Makes me happy for you! I'm clean 372 days. I know how it is, and how it was. [end]
[start] I hope you know that some internet stranger is so very proud of you! Keep going, OP! Hope life keeps smiling at you and your family :) [end]
[start] Congratulations! I’m proud of you homie [end]
[start] Congratulations I’m so happy for you!!!! You take care of yourself [end]
[start] That is so wonderful!  Your little goober deserves a clean and sober daddy.  Keep up the good work--I'm sure every day is a struggle but you are doing a great job. [end]
[start] I know you still have a lifetime of fighting this, but well done,  you have done so well, and even have a bundle of joy to watch grow !  You have got this,  Love, a proud internet stranger :) [end]
[start] This is amazing! Good work, keep at it!! [end]
[start] Congratulations. Although at first I was disappointed because I misread and thought you've quit math :D [end]
[start] Congratulations, dude. What you did takes a hell of a lot of strength and fortitude. Good on you for persevering and turning your life around. All the best to you and your loved ones! [end]
[start] This fight is going to last for the rest of your life. But now that u have a family hopefully you won’t be hanging around those kind of people anymore. When I don’t see it, I don’t do it. U know what I mean? [end]
[start] DIGITAL HIGH-FIVE!! DIGITAL HUGGG!! That's really awesome!  I'm really happy for you on this milestone. Keep going! :D [end]
[start] Congratulations, way to go man!! [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing this and its awesome to hear that you’re off of it!   Could you explain or share some things about your psychosis and what it was like? [end]
[start] That is really fucking awesome. Congrats. [end]
[start] Love this! Congrats! Here’s to many more years of sobriety!! 🥳 [end]
[start] Wonderful to hear - my cousin was also addicted, somehow kept her kids through it all before she finally quit. Now her kids are giving her grandkids and maintaining stable relationships. You hear so many tragic outcomes with drugs, but we should appreciate and be grateful for the success stories. Congrats! [end]
[start] That’s awesome!! You’ll definitely still have your down days and moment but that’s okay!! Just know you will always be able to make it through to the other side. I’m very happy for you and you should be very proud of yourself. [end]
[start] So, im a 13 year old dph addict, I’ve used other pills but dph is the main one. I think meth also causes derealization, how’d you deal with it? It’s something that I still get, being two days clean. [end]
[start] Bro, honestly, this is the best thing I''ll hear today, and I'm being honest.  STAY STRONG!  A coworker's son got clean for a bit after having a kid but would then relapse, then get clean for a couple months...and one relapse was a little too strong and they found him dead of an overdose. [end]
[start] This warms my heart so much. Best wishes to you and your family <3 stay strong my friend, keep doing what you’re doing. that’s awesome [end]
[start] Congrats 🥳 that’s such a good story to read all the best x [end]
[start] Congratulations I'm so happy to hear you doing well! Wishing you and your family nothing but blessings [end]
[start] Congratulations! That is awesome!! [end]
[start] Stay strong brother!  Read this every day, twice on the hard ones. [end]
[start] HEROIC. 👏👏👏👏👏  Congratulations, young dad! [end]
[start] I have tremendous respect for you [end]
[start] So happy for you 👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️ [end]
[start] I am so proud of you. My older brother is also in recover for meth and I see how hard it is for him at times. You are so loved and so enough and I’m so so happy for you!! [end]
[start] Congrats man! [end]
[start] I'm proud of you [end]
[start] Congratulations!  I was going to say Congrats, but you get it all for what you have done!  Yes, it is a group project to get clean, but you are the largest part of it, so take that credit.  You did a fabulous job that many can't.  Someone once told me that the hardest part of getting clean is imagining saying no to drugs forever.  He said that you don't actually have to do that, you just have to say no for today.  Everyday.  Sometimes it's best to look at the short term, but you have done it for the long term and that is freaking awesome! [end]
[start] amazing so proud of you! i’ve been clean almost 2 years never give up! [end]
[start] so proud of you ❤️ [end]
[start] Congrats! Keep going strong!   10 months clean here, after 12 years of amphetamine/weed/Benzo/alcohol/+ abuse.  Also started getting looney as fuck at the end, the tv started talking to me and i thought everyone had cameras around me and shit.  Luckily found out it wasn't the way i wanted it all to end, and now i'm starting to feel almost half-sane again :D.   Love and light, brother. [end]
[start] Holy shit man, that's awesome. Best of luck from here on out, I hope you're able to give your kid a great life because you've got it in you. [end]
[start] Congratulations! [end]
[start] Wow. This is great. Congratulations. It only gets better from here!!! 🙏 [end]
[start] Holy shit! How did you make it so long on that stuff!? I did that shit for about a year and thankfully I got money taken from me and my supplier disappeared but I can only imagine the rabbit hole more time would have led to!! Fuckin badass of you to quit and keep it away!!!! [end]
[start] You should've waited longer to have a child. Seems irresponsible [end]
[start] 13 years old shooting meth ?? Wtf !? And you got a wife too ?!! [end]
[start] has a fucking baby before even having a year or two clean. you’re gonna fuck that kid’s life up proper, at the very least because you both decided to pass on your addict genes to an innocent kid. you get no praise from me, you’re an idiot. [end]
[start] methhead lol [end]
[TITLE] Yesterday my country became North Korea 2.0... :( [TITLE]
[start] Wow, thank you for posting this, most of us would have absolutely no idea this happened. Please keep yourself safe, it sounds like things could get unstable. [end]
[start] Fuuuck me. I didn't know things where like this there, op.  Damn. [end]
[start] You should xpost that link to /r/worldnews - this post is the first I've heard of it, and it needs more exposure than it will get on /r/self.  Terribly sorry to hear about this. [end]
[start] This sounds more like Egypt then North Korea, not to downplay the troubles going on in the Ukraine, but North Korea is a real freak of nature for a country. [end]
[start] Jesus Christ man. I knew Ukraine's government was siding with Russia over the EU against the wishes of the people. But I didn't realize it was this bad. Holy fuck, CNN has been on in the background all day and I haven't heard a mention of it.   Hopefully the people can somehow stop this.    Its crazy, my family got out of Ukraine as it was becoming a Soviet State. If my grandpa made different choices I could have been over there now.   Good luck, I really hope the people can somehow turn things around.   [end]
[start] Hey brother, so sorry about that. I feel like something similar is happening in Russia too and it feels like it's just going to get worse and worse as the time goes.   Btw, why do you say "you know what Russians think about us". What do they think? I am Russian myself and always thought about Ukrainians as my brothers and sisters, the neighbor-country that we have so much in common! Our parents grew up together, going to the same kindergartens and sitting side-by-side in school.  [end]
[start] I'm so sorry this is happening. Love and prayers from a Polish girl, I'll spread the word however I can. *Hug* [end]
[start] This is horrifying. Is there anything you think the general international public could do to help? [end]
[start] The most shitty part of all this, is that the president in fact never wanted to close any deal with EU.   Since most people were hopping for it, he didn't want to build tension before and needed as escape goat, so he waited until November to show his real plan. This way he could blame the FMI and EU terms for an agreement and go lick Putin's ass. (sorry but really feel like saying it this way).  This president is a shameless corrupt mofo, and believe it or not, what makes me feel better is that people like him always have a bad end.   I hope Ukraine will turn this around and if not before, in the next elections that I hope everything is done to not let them be rigger once more.  The problem is the damage in the country's democracy that this president will do until than, that so far Ukraine had enough of it already.  [end]
[start] Crimney. I knew things were bad in Україна, but this is worse than anything I've been hearing thus far.  [end]
[start] how do you get on the internet now? do you use a VPN or a proxy? or you go all bare chest no proxies style? [end]

[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Hey. I'm a Russian who lived 2 years in Kiev, that's the capiral of Ukraine, by the way. Want my perspective on how it got there?   Yes, the current goverment is trying to eatablish a dicratorship, while being largely incompetent at anything, including dictatorship establishment.  But, "Near a quarter of our population is ethnic Russians", which actually looks like a low estimate. A quater of your population's native language has no legal status in your country. Fuck us, right?  "freedom fighters"? Well, they fought against USSR. The problem is, they also collaborated with the nazis on killing Jews, were directly involved in WP:"Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia" and other equally glorious episodes. Sorry, I don't see how one can name them "national heroes".   Yet, the previous Ukranian government did exactly that. Antagonizing with the Russian-speaking part of population (to absurdity, like, theatres forbidden from running movies in Russian), celebrating the very controversial "freedom fighters", being both economically and politically incompetent. See where this is going? The eastern (Russian-speaking) part of Ukraine was glad to vote for the Devil, if he'd offer them more rights and recognition.  Good for you, the current president is not a Devil. He's a thief and a bully, and not the smartest one either. Well, I'm no longer in Ukraine, so hope you guys can get your shit together without breaking the country in two. The problem is, with all the anti-Russian rethorics, you won't get support from the Russian-speaking part of the country, so it might be a good idea to forget about the bloody USSR, and finally figure out how you could all live in your own country now.  Бажаю удачі! [end]
[start] Are you able to get the hell out of there? [end]
[start] Thank you for posting. It is a terrible situation and Ukrainians deserve a better life than this horrible repression. How can we help? [end]
[start] I spent a month in Ukraine last summer. I really enjoyed it and was hoping to go again this summer, but that's not looking very probable anymore. :(  Hopefully this changes somehow. Though without some outside help like from the EU or UN or something, that would be very difficult. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] If it's as bad as you say, this was pretty brave of you. [end]
[start] Is it possible to receive aid from foreign embassies? Is it possible to leave the country? permanently or temporarily as if to wait out the turmoil?  Despite this I wish you the best; yet-another-user. May you and your loved ones remain safe and good fortune finds you all. Good Luck. [end]
[start] This is ridiculous ! We're in 2014 ! Free speech should be legal everywhere ! Censorship never solves problems, it actyally create a lot more.. Stay safe out there, man !  [end]
[start] Happening here in canada too. Anonomenity at protests is punishable by ten years in prison, secret courts... hell, our government has been offcially renamed after our king. [end]
[start] As a first generation American (Ukrainian parents moved here in the 70s) this is especially crazy to me. Wonder if they know, gonna have to give them a call [end]
[start] If you want to learn about what is going on in Ukraine, I suggest this documentary by VICE - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oei0AoCn2A [end]
[start] I heard about this. I don't know what I can do but wish you good luck and please get out of Ukraine.... if you want to. [end]
[start] Have no worries. This government will tear itself apart in no time.  Lol at the "shame tax" which is basically saying, "good bye global economy".  [end]
[start] Damn, the only way Ukraine has been in the news here in The Netherlands was about the how Russia was strong-arming Ukraine into not signing another pro-EU, and that that was the reason for the riots. I didn't know there was such an internal struggle going on. [end]
[start] If by North Korea 2.0 you mean 1980 Ukraine, then sure.  So quick to forget your history. [end]
[start] Got a spare bedroom if you can escape to America and need a place to crash.  That's awful man. [end]
[start] That's rough, hopefully it won't last. Have you considered moving to a different country?  Can Russia really influence countries to turn into police states like this? Kind of unbelievable, but then again I'm just an uninformed American. [end]
[start] Hey, sorry man. [end]
[start] stay alive and breathing, hopefully shit changes. good luck.  [end]
[start] Well, fuck me. I mean, quite literally, it seems like my life is being fucked right now. Guess I'll pack my things and go wherever. I'm sure as hell not going to live in this shit. [end]
[start] I really hoped youd join europe for purely selfish reasons, it would be easier to get to kazantip.  You are on the march to progess and these things are minor blights along the way.  Good luck in your endeavours. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] From former Moldovan internet hug brother.  I don't belong to any of the groups now, I'm a foreigner in Moldova both to Moldovans and Russian Moldovans, and I'm sure as hell a foreigner in my current country of residence, forever alone.  Not sure why I shared that. Sorry. [end]
[start] Damn, I'd leave the country if I was you. Life is just too short to deal with that shit. I can take you in my house if you wanted to, I live in Argentina. [end]
[start] Well, now I understand a bit better why my friend, who went over about 8 months ago and was loving it there, suddenly and urgently wants to get out and come home.  So sad.  I wish the best for all of you there. [end]
[start] The people need to stand up to this. They must depose this government  [end]
[start] That has absolutely nothing on North Korea. Your country doesn't have gulags, public executions or famines. Pretty poor comparison. [end]
[start] This is why I immigrated out of that region in the 1990s. Even though ex Soviet republics cluster became democratic in 1990s, I knew that area was far too unstable and predicted that within the next 10-15 years would turn into dictatorships. Russia is the shot caller and with Putin for the foreseeable future there is no change coming.        Now its up to the people, if they bend over and take it then they deserve to live like that, otherwise go out on the streets and declare a global strike. A strike is more effective than demonstrations. [end]
[start] My heritage is Ukrainian, I hope this stuff ends soon, keep fighting! [end]
[start] Alright man,  two questions,   1. how can the average American/westerner help your cause?   2. Do you guys have a well written Constitution that you can stand by?  [end]
[start] Not to mention all that land that's been loaned (sold?) to China by the reigning administration...   Edit: [This diagram](http://chesno.org/media/uploads/dictatorship-en.jpg) explains the new laws relatively clearly. [end]
[start] My girlfriend is from Ukraine, she is going to come visit me in Sweden in three weeks. I hope she never have to go back, as I've heard how the situation has gotten worse and worse there. It is terrible. :( [end]
[start] Well my friend, it looks like it's time for your country to riot and lead the pigs to their slaughter. God speed.  [end]
[start] The people, united, will never be defeated, my friend.  [end]
[start] Well fuck. I thought Romania had it rough with bad government since... like WW2. But Bulgaria and Ukraine, the 2 nearest big countries are doing much worse. Bulgaria with their pretty big turkish population, and Ukraine with the Russian population. We only have like 300k gypsies, but they rarely get into government to cause problems. They only steal and bribe.  At least Poland is doing fine from what i know. Only country in Eastern Europe, from former USSR who is actually doing fine. [end]
[start] It's brave of you to spread the word like this! Stay safe! [end]
[start] Stay strong. They're passing these laws because they are afraid. They are afraid because you are more powerful united than they can ever dream to be, because what you seek is right. You will prevail by Ukrainian friend. Just be safe. [end]
[start] Well, you did not write what other nations, like Poles, think about your "heroes" like Bandera: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Bandera#Bandera_and_the_Poles  "In late 1942, Bandera's organization, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, was involved in a campaign of ethnic cleansing of Volhynia, and in early 1944, these campaigns began to include Eastern Galicia. It is estimated that over 40,000 Poles were killed during the spring and summer campaign of 1943 in Volhynia[34] by the OUN-Bandera which bears primary responsibility for the massacres." [end]

[start] Take a moment to learn about techniques to bypass online censorship and consequences of using them. If things get tough at least the message could get out. [end]
[start] I don't know much about your politics, but what do you think of vitali klitchko running for president? [end]
[start] I'll be praying for you. [end]
[start] Sounds a lot like [bill 78](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/anti-protest-legislation-passes-in-quebec/article4186770/) in Quebec in spring 2012 when they prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people without police approval.  [end]

[start] Vice had some interesting footage from the protests back in December for anyone interested https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oei0AoCn2A&feature=youtube_gdata_player [end]
[start] I wish you good luck. Really. [end]
[start] Sorry, man! Those are really strict law makers. I wish you best of luck. [end]
[start] I wish you the best and I wish your country my best OP.  [end]
[start] Can't do much to help except spread the message for you, OP, but I'll have a Chicken Kiev for dinner tonight in your honor.  [end]
[start] If you defect to the US, there is an apartment for rent next to me. My wife will bake you peanut butter cookies with little  Reese Cups in them. [end]
[start] I've heard a lot about Ukraine on the news lately. Didn't know it has become this bad. How are you handling it? Fighting it? Sitting it out? Leaving country? [end]
[start] That's crazy! I can't believe I haven't heard anything about this! It's scary to think how something like this can happen so fast and unprovoked. It's really an eyeopener.. [end]
[start] I feel sorry for you and your people OP. I will spread the word.  [end]
[start] Damn, that sounds terrible. Sorry that your year had to start this way. Hopefully things will get better to the people of Ukraine. Good luck, friends! [end]
[start] The state is a bitch.  [end]
[start] Bloody hell. Wish you guys the best of luck, and hope any upcoming further revolution is as bloodless as possible. [end]
[start] Fuck :(  I hope you and your country are spared from civil war. I've shared your story to make as much people aware as possible - hopefully that'll do some good.  If you expect unrest to result, I hope you have a bugout bag with some survival necessities prepared. (For tips, check out /r/preppers - they may overdo it sometinmes, but they got the right idea) [end]
[start] To be honest i am happy for your county in the worst way possible. This is a huge defeat for the people, but at least now you know exactly what the government wants. I think this will make it easier for a real revolution to take place. Hang in there OP, it wont be long before the people demand justice and laugh in the face of unjust laws.  Sometimes I wish something this drastic would happen in the US. When there are no more lies to hide behind and true intentions are exposed, the people will not inly demand change, they will take it. [end]
[start] I have a question a bit unrelated to your current crisis, though I do extend my condolences. What is it like living in a nation with an entire area completely zoned off as radioactive and uninhabitable? I mean no disrespect in this question, I'm just very curious, and never really had the chance to ask a real Ukrainian. Is it talked about much in your day-to-day life? Is it regarded with any sort of care, like is it a big deal? Do you fear the inevitable decay of the Sarcophagus and a possible radiation blow-out?     Also, am de Ukrainian vemen of beautiful? [end]
[start] As a Ukrainian, I'm glad I moved to the US.  [end]
[start] n.korea v2.0? sounds like turkey v2.0. [end]
[start] Ok, you're addressing a lot of good points here, but please...  > about language (obv Russians want status of official lang for Russian, and we, Ukrainians, say them "fuck you, it's our country")  *Calm down* with the fucking ethnocentrism. Just because ~75% of the country is made up of ethnic Ukrainians doesn't make it all "[their] country". They've got a right to ask for equal rights and even a bilingual government, even though you might find them annoying. [end]
[start] Beautiful country tho, aesthetically and nature wise speaking, and has a lot of potential. [end]
[start] Damn, Clancy is hitting the nail on the head with his last book. [end]
[start] tl;dr op got arrested for posting. But on a serious side, sorry to hear about things, OP! Stay safe, Reddit is supporting you. [end]
[start] Let's not get carried away. You are the new Belarus. To be the new North Korea you have to first have mass starvation.  [end]
[start] A bunch of fucking garbage. I can't believe this kind of thing happens in our world, in the view of the world, and is often overlooked. I had heard things were taking a turn for the worse over there but I had no idea it was to be so bad so shortly. I am not Ukranian but I am human. Stay strong, friend, and the same to your countrymen. I cannot help you as I would wish to, but I wish for you the best for your country, because it is what is also best for world and humanity. Nobody should have to live in fear as this. Good luck and power to you. [end]
[start] Everybody go to the street, they can't arrest the entire country.  [end]
[start] So ... what's the penalty for assassination?  Edit:  Please don't answer this question, OP.  I'm worried that your new "government" might locate you and cause you grief for even giving a real answer. [end]

[start] Maybe you should think ahead, learn some internet privacy details while you can. Download tor just incase. Anyone have anything else to add? [end]
[start] What do you mean by "ethnic" Russians. [end]
[start] You need to get the hell out of there. People have to realize that ''countries'' are simply tax farms ruled by gangster families who got the territories through violence. That's why they try to brainwash you with patriotism since a young age (pledge of allegiance, national anthem, etc.) [end]
[start] Maybe it is time to be quiet now until the upcoming elections and then just vote for change. When will they take place? I really put some hope in Klitschko winning. [end]
[start] Will the police actually be able to enforce these things? (Or will they??) Some just seem especially crazy like the 5 car one. [end]
[start] Most of these new laws have already been pushed in France with Sarkozy. [end]
[start] What's going to happen to Na'Vi? [end]
[start] I'm not clear on something. Is Russia behind these new laws, or is it native Fascism in support of Russia? And why would this be so, isn't the Ukraine a sovereign nation, or does Russia still pull the political strings there?   [end]
[start] maybe on a more regional note, your country is mimicking old Romenia...the dictatorial one.   fuck. It's an awful place right now to be. You guys do not deserve this, no one does. I'm guessing there will be some more emigration, no? [end]

[start] Nothing close to North Korea.  Sorry man, but until you can't move without a permission slip from the government, and are forced to live in apartments when living in urban areas, you're nowhere close to North Korea. [end]

[start] > * Yesterday the parliament majority (Party of Regions + Communist party) completely broke the regulations and voted for laws without discussion and by raising hands instead of using the system "Rada", and they claimed that there were always 235 hands in support of laws that they passed (on the photos, you can see that there are only near 120 hands "voting"). Counting hands took 3 seconds for every vote, 38 seconds were spent on each law. This procedure is enough to forget about any democracy in our country.  I don't mean to sound flippant about your nation's serious problems, but you can thank the US state of Michigan for giving your politicians *that* particular idea. [end]
[start] My ex has family there :/ [end]
[start] For any of you who think that Ukraine should stay with Russia, you should remember that back in the mid 1900's Joseph Stalin killed over 5 MILLION UKRAINIANS.     It was a genocide!

It's to allow people to change lanes, and also serves as a way to further outlaw groups of asshole motorcyclists that shutdown freeways.  >You can be punished by 2 years of jail for "defamation" (what is defamation and what isn't - it is decided by our corrupted judges). We have libel and slander laws too.  We certainly have corrupt judges, although I'd like to believe that most of our judges are good.  >It is a crime to insult a judge or a policeman, also it's illegal to collect information about policemen and judges (it is because we protesters collected information about policemen that beat people and judges that made unlawful resolutions in order to punish them (in legal ways only)). I'm pretty sure we don't have this, but that it's possible to get in trouble for sharing this information.  >Blocking of entrance to house (3 years of jail), blocking administration buildings (5 years) Penalties here aren't nearly as harsh.  >It is now illegal to use helmet, hard hat, mask or even scarf on your face when you gather together Can't cover your face or have a stick beyond a certain diameter and length.  Also can't use audio amplification devices, so no bullhorns or boomboxes.  >Extremism (every call to overthrow the current government (the main demand of our protests now), including call in the Internet, is extremism too) is punished very strictly now I can understand calls to overthrow the government being too far.  Unfortunately protesters here get way too much attention from the police, corporate spies and the FBI for trying to change the government through existing democratic channels, particularly voting.  >The law that was intended to free political prisoners (pushed by opposition) that were imprisoned during protests, was revised in the way that it also makes police forces non-responsible for their crimes Our police get away with a lot of crap too.  The most recent fad is to say they were scared for their safety, which justifies virtually any response even if that gravely endangers many bystanders. [end]

[start] Isn't this illegal? [end]
[start] Sounds like you got Americanized.   [end]
[start] Come to the US.  We'll take you.  We have go karts and bacon cheese burgers that will make you hate yourself when you're done.  [end]
[start] Its your own fault for voting for the party of regions in the first place. You vote in the party that openly represents the interests of the minority ethnicity, and then are shocked when they proceed to do everything they can to protect those minority interests.  Full retard much? [end]
[start] Is Ukraine.  Can dig potato, eat potato, next winter more potato.  Sometime burn potato, but still potato. [end]
[start] The fact that you are posting this now determined that was a lie. [end]
[start] If anyone is interested, here's a point by point of why op is skewing the facts to make you support his position:  •You can't gather more than 5 cars in a column (so, traffic jams are illegal now). traffic jams are not illegal. Having five cars blocking the street for protest purposes is illegal.  •You can be judged without presence of you or even your lawyer. Yes, if you REFUSE to show up to court. Shocking!  •You can be punished by 2 years of jail for "defamation" (what is defamation and what isn't - it is decided by our corrupted judges). This is nothing new. The corrupt judges were already putting people in jail for this before.  •Blocking of entrance to house (3 years of jail), blocking administration buildings (5 years) This is illegal anywhere. Its a fire hazard.  •It is now illegal to use helmet, hard hat, mask or even scarf on your face when you gather together Yea, next they'll say you can't wear hats in a bank.   •Huge Internet restrictions, complete Internet censorship (materials can be banned even without court) This one he just made up.  •Extremism (every call to overthrow the current government (the main demand of our protests now), including call in the Internet, is extremism too) is punished very strictly now As it is in any other country. Its called treason, and every western democracy has laws against it.  •Organizations and people that receive funding abroad should be called "foreign agents" and should pay shameful tax. Foreign agents labeled as foreign agents? That's terrible. What is the world coming to?  •The law that was intended to free political prisoners (pushed by opposition) that were imprisoned during protests, was revised in the way that it also makes police forces non-responsible for their crimes Which means this criminals will actually be prosecuted for their crimes.  •The immunity of deputy can be cancelled much easier than before (in order to target political opposition that backs our protest) Which means that politicians will have a harder time coming o power I they are engaged in criminal activity. Fun fact, president of Ukraine has a rape conviction.  [end]
[TITLE] I turned 40 yesterday. Here are some lessons I've learned, without fluff or BS. [TITLE]
[start] As a dentist, I could not emphasis how important daily flossing is, it will help prevent future dental issues and expensive dental bills. But I would add, always floss before going to sleep [end]
[start] 11) Cultivate a Work Life Balance and hold strong to it  " Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air.  They are **Work, Family, Health, Friends and Spirit** and you’re keeping all of these in the air.  You will soon understand that **work** is a rubber ball.  If you drop it, it will bounce back.  But the other four Balls – **Family, Health, Friends and Spirit** – are made of glass.  If you drop one of these they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered.  They will never be the same.  You must understand that and strive for it. " -  **Coca Cola's** Former **CEO**, Bryan Dyson  &#x200B;  edit: added shit [end]
[start] I read through this. Thanks a lot. I especially needed to hear the jealousy one. It plagued me. [end]
[start] Also live your life and dont take random people's advice at face value because everyone is different [end]
[start] Wear sunscreen [end]
[start] Some of the most sound and realistic advice. Well said sir. Take my upvote [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Happy belated birthday man, hope you had a great day [end]
[start] I’m 22, relatively fresh out of college, and horrifically lost on top of heartbroken. Thanks for this, I needed it. While this kind of advice never fixes me feeling lost and scared, it does at least assure me and give me some sort of guidance going forward. Happy belated birthday. [end]
[start] Re: regrets, I often will pull out this movie quote, when I'm asked about my own regrets:  Regrets are a waste of time; they're the past killing you in the present.    Now, this isn't to say that I am regret-free, because that's in no way true.  However, I have been able to train myself to recognize when I'm spinning a web of bullshit designed to allow myself to give in to feeling sorry for myself -- and I try to kick that shit in it's ass tout suite.  Regrets **are** a huge waste of time, take experience for what it is: a lesson on how to do better next time. [end]
[start] 6) hit home so hard. In a slightly different angle, but I actually never imagined you could live too much in the future....I feel like whole my adult life I’ve been busy preparing for the future - to have better conditions, to prevent something like getting hurt and being in a financially bad state etc. But living so far ahead ironically makes you lose perspective of what’s really important. And that seems to be enjoying the present. Take in as much as you can. [end]
[start] Level 40 now, eh!  What kinda mount did ya get? [end]
[start] You forgot #11 retospect. I'm 60 and remember my 40s reflecting on my life. The worst thing was thinking I could compartmentalize my life and get some mindful retrospect. Well, it never came. I figured out cliches can be more meaningful than you'd imagine. Live every moment like it's your first and your last. Put your head down and trudge forward not dwelling on the past nor trying to predict the future or you'll miss what's at your feet. There is no path or key to life. Just live it for who you are for the moment you're in and enjoy the spontinuity. [end]
[start] An addition to #8 is don’t settle. If something doesn’t feel right then it probably isn’t. There are so many instances of people not listening to their guts and moving on when necessary. With love, you HAVE TO have that hard conversation or those things will fester and plant the seeds of resentment, anger, and frustration.   I will be turning 40 in a few weeks and while I do not regret anything major at this point there are smaller things I wish I would have handled. Would my life have changed drastically? Probably not but I will never know and now am in a position where I may have to make a life altering change.   On that note, make sure that when you find “that one” that you both live for EACH OTHERS happiness as feverishly and fervently as your own. If this is ever of question, then that is a deal breaker. People are different and everyone likes/wants different things but love and marriage is a partnership, plain and simple. If it is lopsided it will eventually break things down. [end]
[start] > We won't recognize the good old days for what they were until they're already gone.   Preach.  You're living 20 years from now's "good old days" this very moment, especially if you care about and love the people around you. [end]
[start] These are all great points of wisdom.  But, as clear as things seem right now at 40, I assure you that when you are 60, and look back at 40, you will realize you were fairly clueless.  That's not a flame on you, it's just the way life works. [end]
[start] #7 it's something everyone needs to practice.  Thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] I like this list - definitely some good reminders for my 20s. [end]
[start] Thank you for this. It’s my last night at home before I leave for college and I was so worried. Scrolling through reddit to try and find a sign that things will be okay. Well, I think I found it :) I’m gonna meet so many new people, and learn new things, and I’ll try to take advantage of every opportunity I get <3 [end]
[start] Yup. To everything you said.   Lots of heartache and regret from not following several of these rules in my own life. [end]
[start] Thank you for this. Im in my 20s and constantly wanting advice like this [end]
[start] I'm 6 months into 40 and you nailed all of these points. [end]
[start] I'm Turning 50 in a year. Where were you when I was in my 20s. Never mind I wouldn't have listened anyway. Good advice though. Spot on. [end]
[start] About to hit 40 myself this year. Agree with everything you said. Also save money. I don’t have shit saved so I feel fucked but I got a job and as long as I’m breathing with a functional brain and abled body, I’ve got all I need to make it [end]
[start] Happy birthday, man! I hope you can live until you're 101 years old. Thank you for sharing these lessons! [end]
[start] Great advice. Thank you for saying all these things. I'm in my late 20s and I'm trying to get my life on track and live in the here and now. I know time will go by so much faster than I think. [end]
[start] happy birthday, even if i am late. I am only 21 and a lot of these advices were relatable to my current situation, thanks i am going to save this and read it again during hard times or when i feel lost [end]
[start] I absolutely love reading things like this. Thanks for the post, stranger. [end]
[start] On regrets, be careful not to confuse contentment with complacency. I made myself unhappy and could have destroyed my life because at a time when I was doing well enough, I felt I needed to be making power moves to avoid complacency. [end]
[start] Am 35 years old, and these lessons would be what I'd impart. [end]
[start] Wait, I have to wear condoms? [end]
[start] I'm a 19yo who's trying to figure out how I manage demons from my past, ambitions for my future, and my stresses at current. It's hard and I've lost my partner whom I cared for deeply through no fault of my own. It hurts, but I've come to realise that maybe we weren't write for each other, and that I possibly may be happier being single. This post/Reddit generally really made me think about my life as a whole, and all the wonderful and inspiring and sound things I read here are truly helping. I like to think for someone so young I'm somewhat wise, and I hope that it carries on growing so one day I can guide others who feel as lost as me. I hope to help them find comfort and find themselves in a world of confusion and emotions and responsibilities, and this (among a few other Reddit posts) will be part of that journey. Thank you for sharing this. You're a good person. [end]
[start] Number 10 is a big BIG one. Being told "no" might seem scary but long term "what if" is what keeps you up at night. [end]
[start] At 48, I agree with some, not others. Not that it's bad advice, it isn't, but it's not in my life lessons to pass along.   If you want to find Zen, each the worst shit sandwich you can find, metaphorically, then all problems in life seem pedantic, or just realize that life is full of problems, real problems, that we all have to deal with. That's what I discovered at 45, and life is frickin awesome now. No real worries or stresses. Laid off, meh, no biggie. Not enough to pay a bill, cool. Sick, oh well! I lived in hell for years, so now, life isn't all that complicated. It's all downhill from here for 20+ years I have left. Even getting older is actually enjoyable, as I get wiser. My best days keep happening, and I don't have any regrets, as the lessons I learned are from the mistakes I made. If I had a regret,  then that means I'm still paying the cost for something I already learned. Just. Move. Forward. And . Learn! [end]
[start] I 100% concur with the advice on flossing. I’d like to add that it’s not a good idea to skip going to the dentist for checkups and cleanings. You will regret it. [end]
[start] > 3) College isn't for everyone, but you'll rarely be put square in the  middle of so much potential experience. You'll meet people you probably  wouldn't have otherwise, and as you eventually pursue your major, you'll  get to know people who share your passions and dreams. Despite all the  bullshit ways in which college sucks   Also for the most part it will vastly raise the ceiling on your pay....and put you ahead of potential candidates without a degree. I also thought the only part of college that sucked was paying back the loans - and that one semester I took 4 programming intensive courses at once. Don't ever do that :P  > 4) Learn to manage your money.   To add onto that - don't ever loan money you're not ok with losing. I loaned a large amount of money to someone I "knew" would pay me back. I got back less than 1% of it. [end]
[start] needed this atm [end]
[start] Happy belated birthday and thank you for this post, it brought tears to my eyes [end]
[start] Thanks for this. [end]
[start] Such a great list! [end]
[start] Listen to Bas Lurhmann everybody's free! Keeps what OP says in your mind with a nice tune to it! [end]
[start] Thank you for saying all of this.  Very well written.  I am in my upper 30s at this point and everything you wrote rings so true. [end]
[start] Happy birthday and thanks for your words of wisdom. (: [end]
[start] Thanks for this... alot of this is so helpful to me ... I'm 23 at the moment and will definitely remember this post [end]
[start] Thank you, so much. A lot of people including myself needed to read this today. [end]
[start] hey random comment but we have the same birthday!  I turn 17 today. [end]
[start] I needed this today. Thank you. [end]
[start] I cannot stress the importance of wearing sunscreen. The long term benefits of wearing sunscreen have been well established, whereas the rest of my advice comes from my own meandering experience. [end]
[start] I can't give you reddit gold, but I can give you an upvote! Really helpful lessons here, thank you OP! :P [end]
[start] Lol..wait till you turn 50..youll be a bonafide guru..lol [end]
[start] The regret thing - at times in my life ive had to make a choice and twice ive said to a friend i know ill regret this but im gonna do it anyways. One was walking out the front door is my house and letting it just get foreclosed on. I owed $68,000 and the person who bought it next paid$130,000. I was going thru a very hard time emotionally in life during this stupid decision. But the worst thing i regret and can never fix is not making up with my mother after a stupid fight and she died. I was able to tell her i was sorry just a few hours before she passed. I had only had her in my life for the last 4 yrs of her life and the last 6 months i refused to talk to her. This will haunt me till the day i die. [end]
[start] "Be kind to yourself," said sdbear at 78. [end]
[start] Words to live by. Thank you, this is just what I needed. I'm young, I'll make the best of it. [end]
[start] This is one is the best posts I’ve seen here. Reminds me of a book that’s very close to my heart called “Live and Learn and Pass it on“  Happy Birthday btw :)   I’m close to you in age and agree with everything you wrote x10. Especially the flossing and saving $ part. [end]
[start] Hah. I'm in my mid 20s and I feel like I've been learning each of these same lessons incrementally through experience. Thanks for the cliff notes for the upcoming ones though, time to get ahead of the game! [end]
[start] Jesus Christ this is good advice - all of it. 45 yr old looking back at all the stupid shit I did when I was young...some I regret and some I don't. When you are young and free 18-25 it's hard to worry about shit that's going to affect you 20-30yrs later - but holy shit those years just fucking fly by!  Attn :Young people - I know you don't care- we're just boring nagging old fucks, but just read this advice and just think about it.  All those older folks out there were all young once too - and we all made some stupid decisions that affect us still. You can't turn back time but you can improve the outcomes with better decisions now.  MAKE DECISIONS THE FUTURE YOU WILL THANK YOU FOR!!! [end]
[start] Just turned 33 and can't agree more with not waiting for exceptional things to happen and not regretting inaction. My wife and I are going to take some big plunges this year and next because we're sick of waiting for things to just happen! [end]
[start] 8.... I don't know if I can fix it. Not brave enough. [end]
[start] Flossing. It's actually not that great/needed. I saw a dentis post on here that YES do it, but when is the last time you did research into it? The said 'benefits' are mostly unproven. [end]
[start] You forgot to add “always use sunscreen” 😂 [end]
[start] Preach [end]
[start] Dude... thank you. This is some intelligence that has never been seen in written format, ever. [end]
[start] I saved this because each one of these speak to me [end]
[start] The first one hit me really. [end]
[start] wow thank you for this, i just got out of a relationship and i really needed this. thank you [end]
[start] I just turned 30 the other week. I feel frail, brittle, old, like it’s over. Soon friends - maybe myself, although nothing to suggest it - will start getting bad medical news and die, parents are getting old, the youth starts to appear more and more out of touch with reality...  Or wait is that 60? Lost track. Born old I guess... [end]
[start] As a 43 year old with the body of an 85 year old- live every day take chances, TRAVEL! say yes to thing instead of automatically saying no.   I wish I would have because now I can’t. I won’t get to travel the world like thought when I retire because now I get exhausted just walking to the end of my street. All the adventures I put off are now gone, because I got sick and it can happen to anyone. [end]
[start] Wish I had one, but you deserved a medal [end]
[start] Man you are a hero for sharing this. [end]
[start] save [end]
[start] #7.  Got me right in heart.  Started smoking at 40.  Now 44, and it’s in check, 8-10 smokes a day, but can’t quit it. [end]
[start] Thank you for this. [end]
[start] Oof that one about relationships hit me hard. [end]
[start] Thank you, I'm on a bad time and I really think this helps, I'll have in mind what you said before doing some things,   I felt like it was me that was talking when said about regrets for doing nothing [end]
[start] Nice. [end]
[start] I have a question, do you think marriage and/or spending one’s life with someone is for everyone? I’m still a young adult so I think it’s kind of a naive question considering I still have my life waiting to happen, but I wanted to hear some opinions from those who’ve played the life game longer than I have. [end]
[start] Thanks for the advice, I needed it too. I recently graduated and thought I was fairly prepared for what was to come, but it has still been a series of disappointments. [end]
[start] I love this.! Thank you for all the wisdom and experience. Yo the best! 🎉 I'll do my best to internalize as much as possible. [end]
[start] As a smoker in the past (now vaping) and a type 1 diabetic with renal insufficiency I can confirm the things about smoking and taking care of your body. I'm not gonna get old. If you wanna be old one day, don't be like me. [end]
[start] Hi [end]
[start] Philipps Sonicare + Gum Detoxify > flossing [end]
[start] Happy Birthday! [end]
[start] This reminds me of this  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI   Both your post and this video have great advice [end]
[start] You forgot to add, don't watch porn. [end]
[start] I don’t think you know how desperately I needed to hear this. Especially number 1. Thank you. [end]
[start] To piggyback no. 9 - stretch your body. Flexibility will serve you well in older age for sure. Yoga, Pilates - whatever you want. [end]
[start] Im very young and regret already haunts me every day, I feel like I will never be true to myself because of the closed circle of regret  Also thanks for posting this [end]
[start] Wow, thank you for this. I didn’t want this list to end. [end]
[start] thank you and happy birthday. [end]
[start] This ....wow [end]
[start] I'm turning 38 in October and my advice is go to the gym regularly.  Fit people look younger. [end]
[start] That love one hit home... [end]
[start] Thank you for this. [end]
[start] I love this. [end]
[start] B [end]
[start] I’m 26 and this is literally everything I would say too. I think a lot of that works together to make your mind body soul connection stronger while making your life, sense of self, and intuition just plain better. Just don’t do anything you KNOW is fucking stupid that’s where big regrets come in as well [end]
[start] That is so strange how this entire comment thread is about flossing and it makes me want to force them so thanks OP [end]
[start] To address the flossing advice: from what I’ve heard the saying goes: Brushing your teeth without flossing is like wiping your butt cheek but not your crack... just a great point to ponder. [end]
[start] Is it ever too late to start? [end]
[start] I always appreciated people that share this kind of experience. People read this and its impactful. Appreciate ya buddy. [end]
[start] I just turned 30 this year, it was kind of a big deal for me, and I really enjoyed reading this post. I feel like I’m starting to recognize some of these lessons in my life. Some I’ve learned, some I have yet to learn. Thank you for posting this, I teared up a bit lol [end]
[start] "Few things will haunt you like regret"  Well said. Your intuition or subconscious or superconscious mind is always trying to tell you things but it is a quiet voice and easily rationalized away. Take time to tune into it and have the courage to audaciously follow it's nudges. You may think that something is too good to be true (otherwise why didn't someone else already take it?) but you will see things others can't when you are in tune with your higher conscious faculties. [end]
[start] can you or anyone reading this elaborate on how to deal with jealousy in relationships, and if possible how to quit being easily jealous [end]
[start] I wish I would have taken better care of my teeth I'm 43, and 3 root canals later and lack of flossing make sure you floss and brush your teeth 2x a day! [end]
[start] How to avoid regret...carpe that fucking diem baby!  I am 40M and I can say that I am not haunted today by a single instance of rejection following an honest attempt on my part.  Not from women I asked out, or jobs I applied for etc.  I do have regret for the ones I never asked or the ones I never went for. [end]
[start] Happy Birthday! I turned 40 on the 19th too, great advice btw [end]
[start] This post deserve more upvotes and attention. The things you said are on point. [end]
[start] Great advice there! I definitely agree with #1!!!  Nothing happens unless we make it happen!! [end]
[start] I love it. I'm 34 and this really hit home for me. I'm glad you shared. [end]
[start] Thanks you old fuck, ill pm you some coupon codes for metamucil and... other old people stuff   ^^^I ^^^actually ^^^found ^^^this ^^^insightful [end]
[start] Whole lotta gang shit thank you for this wisdom is always welcomed 🔥🔥🔥 [end]
[start] ⭐ I'm too poor but here you go [end]
[start] 11) Take time EVERY DAY to be thankful for the countless blessings that you have. This takes actual effort because most people don't start to appreciate things until they no longer have them.  12) Have kids in your 20's and 30's. It's the circle of life. Life is about giving, and giving life to others is the ultimate gift. [end]
[start] Fucking lol [end]
[start] Bad advice.  My advice is to not heed these words. [end]
[start] This is some no shit obvious advice. I knew that when I was 11.   I don’t know what I was expecting looking at this post. But I now know it was a waste of time [end]
[TITLE] My son died today [TITLE]
[start] I hope you don’t mind but I saw his photo that you posted when he was born. I am absolutely devastated to hear what has happened to him, but I know this cannot even begin to compare to what you and your partner are going through. He is a beautiful baby boy and he brought joy to this world in the time he was with us. I hope that you and your partner can find peace and cherish the happy memories and the anticipation you went through together. I never met Teddy but I will be thinking about him. If you feel like reaching out to a stranger to talk please feel free to message me, I may not be of much help but I’m available to talk anytime.  [end]
[start] I am so sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you. A guy in Florida will be praying for you and your partner tonight.  [end]

[start] I am so extremely sorry & sad for you!! I can't barely think of anything that would be consoling other than I feel your pain. I lost my daughter to SIDS when she was 6 months. I was in shock & so upset that, I couldn't even drive my car. You folks have a lot of healing to do. I send my LOVE & positive energy. I know that, we don't know each other but, my heart ❤ weeps for you two!! [end]

[start] I have been where you are. There is nothing anyone can say or do to make this better but know that you are loved and tonight I will be thinking of Teddy.  Hugs to you internet stranger ❤️ [end]
[start] I’m so sorry. This must be so hard. May Teddy Rest In Peace, I can assure you that he’s not in any pain anymore. I wish you all the best. [end]
[start] I couldn’t be more sorry for your loss. There’s nothing worse in the world and I wouldn’t wish your pain on anyone. There’s nothing that ever fills that hole in your heart, but try to take care of yourselves as much as you can and seek out support from people you care about. Love to you and your partner at such a hard time [end]
[start] I'm so sorry for your loss. My thoughts are with Teddy, you and your partner tonight. [end]
[start] I’m without words. Cry, hang in to each other and take all of the help you can get. Time is the only thing that will help. This is the darkest moment of your life, and I know it’s impossible to see now, but thinks will get easier and life will get better. Take good care of you and your partner. [end]

[start] My most sincere condolences. I’m at a loss for words really. I’m in shock myself. So sorry to hear about your son.  [end]
[start] If you don't mind, what was he like? Anything about him that made him unmistakably Teddy? [end]
[start] My heart breaks for you and your partner.  May your sweet boy rest in the sweetest peace and I am praying for you tonight.   &#x200B; [end]
[start] From one parent to another, my heart is broken for you. This stranger has been touched by your family. Let us all honor baby Teddy by being as kind and loving as his parents.  [end]
[start] I am very very sorry for your loss. I hope you and your partner can find strength to live through this. I can’t imagine what it is like to lose a child. I know that no words will bring you peace right now but at least his suffering is over.   If you want to talk, I will be available 24/7 for a chat.  [end]
[start] So sorry. [end]
[start] Love to you and your wife  [end]
[start] I am so, so sorry for your loss.  [end]
[start] I'm so terribly sorry for your loss. Rest in peace baby Teddy. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry. ❤️ [end]
[start] I've always loved the name Teddy; I have friends who are due in June who are having a son, and they are naming him Teddy, and I thought it was so cool. I cannot imagine your loss. I hope you and your partner have all the support you need. May your son live eternally in the hearts and minds of all who had the privilege of knowing him!  [end]
[start] There are no words, I’m so so sorry for your loss.  [end]
[start] I’m sorry for your loss.  [end]
[start] So sorry for your loss :((( [end]
[start] He is forever loved, sorely missed, and will never leave your hearts. My heart breaks for you and your partner, hold each other tight. Sweet Teddy will always know the love you have for him.  [end]
[start] I am so, so sorry for your loss😭 [end]
[start] I am so sorry to hear that you lost your son, Teddy. My heart is with you and your partner. [end]
[start] This makes me cry for/with you :’(((( I’m so sorry  [end]
[start] I'm sorry to hear about your son.   I wish I could just be there to give you guys a hug with hope that it'll help a tiny bit.  I'm crying  for you guys.    All the love in the world to you. Keep strong. [end]
[start] I am sobbing and devastated with you. I bet you and your partner are amazing parents! Teddy is as lucky to have had you as you are to have had him. You will be in my thoughts and prayers. My mom will love on him in Heaven until you get there. [end]
[start] I am so sorry. I cannot imagine the pain of your loss. I wish there was something I could do or say to bring you some measure of comfort. My heart mourns with you.  [end]
[start] I wish I had something more profound to say other than from one parent to another I am so terribly sorry for your loss. A journey no parent should ever have to travel. [end]
[start] My heart goes out to you.     I, too, lost my son to HLHS.  Second surgery as well.  I know your pain.   &#x200B;  I can tell you that the pain never really goes away, but it does get easier to deal with.  Know that many people divorce after events like these, but lean into your partner.  You both share an experience that most people will never understand.  You will need each other.     I'm not religious, but if there is any after life I do hope your Teddy finds my Cullen and they get to play together.   [end]
[start] I am so very sorry for your loss. I cannot pretend to comprehend what you are going through, but I noticed on one one of your other posts you said how awful it was that Teddy only knew the inside of a hospital. I want you to know that he knew so much more than that, because he knew you. He felt your touch, your smile, your soft words and your never ending love that knows no boundaries. You gave him what we are all searching for and spend our entire lives trying to find.  There is no comfort right now and these days are the worst fucking shit I could imagine a person ever going through. And I don’t envy you. But I hope that sometime in the future when the jagged edges of grief are not so sharp you can take some small comfort in knowing that you were enough.  Much love to all three of you.  [end]
[start] Sorry to hear... boys, give your kids an extra hug for this little guy. [end]
[start] I’m so, so very sorry.  [end]
[start] I'm so sorry for your  loss. I lost my godmother a few weeks ago from overian cancer. I will pray for you and your family. Teddy, you're in a better place now. [end]
[start] Good thoughts your way, lifting you up.  [end]
[start] I am so so sorry for your loss. All my love from Connecticut.  [end]
[start] I'm so sorry [end]
[start] So very sorry.  [end]
[start] Be strong life goes on! Your son will always be there in your heart. Never give up! Your post inspired me. Love more and then love some more.  [end]
[start] I’m so sorry.  [end]
[start] I am so very sorry for your loss.  [end]
[start] I am very sorry for your loss, something like this is devastating for every parent. I will pray for you and your wife, for both of you to get trough this.   Something like this happens, there is always that slight chance and when that slight chance happens it is so devastating for the people that are closest to the one it happens with and especially when it happens to such a young child.  I just can't imagine how much pain you are going trough right now but please don't give up and please stay strong for your wife and the other people who are affected by this, you all need to take good care for eachother in this tragic time.  And if you feel like you are gonna give up, remember that me and the other people in this amazing community support you and don't want you to lose hope!  If you want to let go of these heavy emotions don't hesitate to reach out for help, even from the people here!  I wish you the best of luck and don't hesitate to PM me or other people if things just get too much for you! [end]
[start] Hugs and love ♥️💔  to you. The unbearable pain of loosing a child is undescribable.  Peace and comfort to sleep and be able to eat.  Hugs ... [end]
[start] I’m so, so sorry. Sending so much love to you. <3 [end]
[start] I’m so sorry. My thoughts are with you tonight. I browsed through your history and saw Teddy’s picture. He was a beautiful baby boy.  [end]
[start] Fucking hell, couldn't understand what your going through, normally i would put down these posts to just bs but i remember your post about your son a while back. <3 [end]
[start] I’m really sorry for your loss. Im sure that doesn’t even begin to help you, but it’ll be ok. We will help you and support you. We may not know who you are but we care.  [end]
[start] 😧 I'm so sorry.  [end]
[start] I’m so sorry <3  [end]
[start] My heart goes out to you and your partner. I’m so sorry for loss. Teddy is now at peace, and one day you and your partner will be too. Life is short, it won’t be too long until both of you are reunited with your son. My thoughts are with you and your partner.  [end]
[start] Teddy knew nothing but love in his time with you. I’m so sorry it ended too soon.  [end]
[start] I’m so sorry for your lost, you and your family will be in my thoughts [end]
[start] I keep staring at this because I can’t think of anything that is the thing to say.   I am so sorry. I am so glad your baby had you and your partner to love him everyday of his life.  [end]
[start] I am so sorry for your loss.  [end]
[start] Sending love. Have known a few young people whose parents had to bury them and the pain is unimaginable.  [end]
[start] Good thoughts are with you and your family. Just breathe, you are not alone.  [end]
[start] I wish you and your partner as much comfort as you can feel. My heart goes out to you. [end]
[start] So sorry for your lost. No pain could be bigger than losing a child. I hope you have enough emotional support. [end]
[start] I am so so sorry.  [end]
[start] I’m so sorry. I know it doesn’t compare, but I have a very sick kitty that I don’t think will be alive next week and it breaks my heart to watch him deteriorate. I feel empathy for you and your partner and can’t imagine the pain involved in the loss of a son. :(  [end]
[start] So sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you and your family. [end]
[start] Rest well and know you are loved, Teddy. My sympathies, prayers, and hopes for healing for you both.  [end]
[start] I am so, so very sorry for your loss. Holding your hand in grief. X [end]
[start] One of my best friends' son, William, died shortly after birth.  5-6 months is a long and brave fight for a little guy.  He must have strong parents.  I love you both.  Teddy will live on through you and your partner.   [end]
[start] /r/babyloss has resources as well as others who have gone through the same thing if you're looking for somewhere to talk it out. [end]
[start] How old was your precious boy?   So sorry for your loss, I can not properly sympathize with your loss since I haven't experienced such a calamity. My prayers go out to you, I don't mean to be offensive but I had a real experience with God in the last year and tho I was on the fence about eternal life and God, I now think that people do move onto a better place, being heaven, so if that gives any reassurance like it has for me, I hope you can hope that you're precious boy moved onto a blissful place of love.  [end]
[start] Hey, I’m only 16 so I can’t fully recognize the pain your going through but, I have HLHS and I know how much your son must have fought to stay alive. I am truly sorry for your loss and I will be praying for him. It’s really sad to hear something went wrong with something I’m so close too. Console in your family and the doctors around you. I know they will help.  [end]
[start] Don't listen to all the haters. He was beautiful. [end]
[start] I’m sorry for your loss 🙏🏼 [end]
[start] Rest In Peace Teddy. I’m sorry you lost your son, nothing anyone can say will be able to take away this pain, but I hope you and your partner will learn to heal for this and I know he will not be forgotten. Stay strong, and be in the presence of loved ones. Much love guys.  [end]
[start] I'm raising a glass from afar.  I know it might be empty from an internet stranger, but you have my most sincere best wishes in the coming months. [end]
[start] I'm so sorry I can't even imagine how that must hurt. I know my condolences mean nothing but I truely do feel sorry for you. I've had a lot of family die but nothing that i believe must have the same emotional consequence. [end]
[start] I am so sorry for your loss.   &#x200B;  While your son's life was far too short, all he knew from you was love. Comfort. Care and concern. And that's what you need for each other now. Love. Hold him, hold each other. Cry, rage, scream if you need to.   &#x200B;  [When you are ready, here's a friend's facebook about her son, Oscar, who also had HLHS.](https://www.facebook.com/amomentintime84/)   &#x200B;  I'm a stranger, and I'm halfway across the world, but I'm an ear. I'm in medicine, and I've been in difficult situations, though none like this. I'm here if you need me. Any time.   &#x200B;  I am so sorry.  [end]
[start] I’ve been trying to write something to you.  There are really no words. I am so sorry you and your partner are going through this.  Please know I’ll pray for Teddy, and for you guys...  my heart is with you... [end]

[start] My heart breaks for you. Words can’t begin to describe how sorry I am. May Teddy rest in peace ❤️ [end]
[start] I'm sorry for your loss bro  &#x200B; [end]
[start] I don’t have any idea what it would be like to imagine that, and i can’t imagine the physical and mental toll it takes on someone. I know you miss him, and i’m so sorry for your loss. but i know that one day you can get to see him and be with him again. i’m praying for you.  [end]
[start] I am so very sorry. I have no idea what you are going through or feeling. Your little boy and his two parents have been so brave. I’ve read your posts about Teddy. He was special and loved before he even arrived. It is clear that you both did everything you could for him. You were blessed to have him and he was blessed to have you, too. You will always be a father. Nothing changes that. I’m not one for prayers, but I send love and light to you, Teddy, Teddy’s Mama, and everyone on Teddy’s medical team.   [end]
[start] I have two baby siblings and this hurts me down to my very soul. I truly hope you recover from this loss.  [end]
[start] Gosh. My brother has HLHS, and I empathize for you. I couldn’t imagine going through the process, and I know it left mom and dad damaged for a long time. <3 My condolences to  you and the family.  [end]
[start] I don't even know you but I sit here with a couple tears in my eyes. I'm so sorry for the loss of Teddy. This hits me hard as our baby girl turns 8 weeks tomorrow and couldn't fathom having to go through this. I truly hope for peace and better days for you and your partner. My condolences.  [end]
[start] I have no idea what you must be going through right now.  I am so sorry. I saw the photo of him you posted before. You're right, he was perfect. A beautiful little soul will be watching over you from now on. Sending you so much love.I hope you can one day have peace [end]

[start] Thank you for being such wonderful parents to Teddy  ❤️ [end]
[start] If there is a life after this one, my daughter, Rachel, can show him around. Maybe they’ll become friends. [end]
[start] There is not a thing a soul could say. I’m so glad Teddy had such wonderful parents and knew that unconditional love you gave him. Please take care of each other. [end]
[start] My baby brother died of the same thing, after his first surgery at 11 days old. That was 23 years ago. Sending lots of love your way. [end]
[start] I am so, so sorry for your loss. A few years ago I came across a comment here on reddit (I saved the text in a note on my phone so I unfortunately I can’t credit the author) and I wanted to share it with you:  "As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.  In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.  Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or holiday. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.  The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. " [end]
[start] I have no words of comfort. I know there aren’t any. I hope you’re able to cherish those amazing memories you do have: his perfect birth, his beautiful face, his incredible life.   I read his story (I hope that’s okay). You did everything you could to keep him here and he fought so hard, as well.   I’m so very sorry for your loss. The world is a little dimmer today.   [end]
[start] Believe we are with you guys right now, even if it is in soul, sending energy to you all, he is in a better place now, believe me.   May him rest in peace, and may the peace slowly embrace your family as a whole..   He is watching you guys, I believe he is in a better place.  PM if you feel like OP, you all not alone at all and i would be glad in giving my presence..  you all stay with God [end]
[start] I rarely comment but my heart hurts for you.... [end]
[start] I know how devastating this is. I have a child with life long disabilities. Just appreciate the time you had, know you did everything you could, and be thankful for the opportunity to have known him. Eventually you'll be able to move on, If not for your sake then your partner's sake. I envy your opportunity to do that. [end]
[start] My heart is breaking for you. Keeping you in my thoughts here in New Jersey. Sending love. [end]
[start] I’m crying with you over in houston tonight. I dug around your profile and saw his birth photo. I have two baby boys myself and I now realize how much I have to lose. I am so sorry for your loss.  [end]

[start] I don’t know you, but I’m so sorry. I know that doesn’t make it any better but...I am truly very sorry. [end]
[start] I don’t have much to say besides that i’m so sorry for your loss. He was just born and had a whole life to live only for it to be taken away early.  I am so sorry again. The only thing i can say to try to brighten your day up is that (in my religion) babies who die early, get immediately a special place in heaven where they will constantly guard over their loved ones. He may not be here with you physically, but he is and always still be with you.  [end]
[start] Sending hugs and prayers.  [end]

[start] Sweet Teddy, I love that name. I’m so sorry, the loss of a child is one of the worst pains imaginable. Please take care in the fact that he is at rest and his heart is perfect where he is now and he is always and forever with you. From one parent to another, your family is in my thoughts and I hope that one day you will find peace in his passing. I’m a firm believer that loved ones don’t truly leave us, we just have to look for their signs. Please look for Teddy’s signs.  [end]

[start] It's hard reading this after just hearing my nephew born last has SCID.   I lost my 3rd son when we has very young. Take pictures. I know its hard but you'll always want to remember Teddy. It will hurt too much to look at them for many years but after the pain subsides you or your partner may want to remember them. You'll cry, as I am now thinking about it and your situation, but at least you'll know you have them when you want to celebrate and remember the time you had with him.   I'm sorry for your loss. Praying peace and comfort for you and your partner through this season of grief and sorrow.  [end]

[start] I was looking at your profile and saw the pic with you and your son. It is such a beautiful picture. A beautiful boy and proud papa.   Be gentle with yourself and your partner.

[start] Rest in Peace sweet Teddy Bear  [end]
[start] From one heart parent to another, I’m so sorry. HLHS is awful, it robs our most innocent of life.  [end]
[start] This is one of the absolute worst things a human can face in this life. Nothing else will ever compare to loosing a child. Time will only heal a very small part of this. I truly hope you and partner can have a small amount of peace at some point in life. Please cry/mourn and don’t suppress the emotions. Don’t ever forget this beautiful little person(I know you won’t) and I hope you grow stronger each passing day. Recently lost a very close immediate family member(not a child) and the pain was immense at first  and has slowly turned into fond memories that I think on daily. I’m sure your pain is much worse than mine. I have nightmares of my kids passing and I wake up in tears. Internet hugs to you dear person I don’t know. The pain is felt by all those reading your post. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry I hope you find comfort in the fact that though you can’t hear him, he’s still there. He’s watching you from heaven 💜 [end]
[start] My heart breaks for you, no more pain for him may his gentle soul Rest In Peace  [end]
[start] I’m so sorry. I have said a prayer for you sweet Teddy.  [end]
[start] My heart goes out to you and your partner. Teddy was a beautiful baby boy.  I’m in tears typing this.. I am so sorry momma😭 [end]
[start] As a 26 year old born with a congenital heart defect-  TGA, this is so painful to read.   May the troubled times fade and Teddy’s spirit remains in the hearts and minds.  [end]
[start] I’m praying for you because the loss of a child is a type of spiritual pain; it’s not even completely possible to describe in words. [end]
[start] I wish there was a word stronger than I’m sorry. Just know he’s with you always and I hope one day you can look back with memories of happy times rather than sadness. Please take care of yourselves.  [end]
[start] So sorry for your loss brother  [end]
[start] Add the Netherlands... I’m so sorry I hope you find peace with his death & learn to live your best life for him . He misses you and loves you also x [end]
[start] A women in New York too! [end]
[start] They say you don’t know what’s like to have kids until you have kids yourself. Likewise I don’t think anyone knows what it’s like to lose a child until it happens to you. As a father myself I can only imagine what it’s like. It’s absolutely horrible and while I don’t pray you’re in my thoughts. Make sure you hang on to each other and go through this together you and your partner. Don’t lose each other in this. All the best! [end]
[start] Prayers for you and your partner during these challenging times. May you find peace and the courage to move forward. May teddy rest in eternal peace and happiness.  [end]
[start] I just had a look through your post history and my heart is breaking for you and your partner. Can’t imagine going through such things. If words from a stranger mean anything, I’m so, so sorry.  [end]
[start] Just one more prayer from China... [end]
[start] My God I’m so sorry. Sending love and prayers for you and your family.  [end]
[start] Add NY to that chain. I am so, so sorry. [end]
[start] My brother and sister in law lost their 11 year old daughter last May, she had a brain tumor. It was sudden and took everyone by surprise. She went in the hospital in the 5th and on the 7th they unplugged her life support. There was nothing the doctor could do because it was on the brain stem. They are still reeling and trying to handle/manage the pain. Just know you are not alone in your pain, if that brings any comfort. I hope that you and your husband will eventually find peace. Sending much love your way [end]
[start] My heart breaks for you, for your partner and for Teddy. That pain, man... I have no words for it. I’m sorry is not enough, so I’ll sit here in silence in memory of Teddy.  [end]
[start] As the father of a one year old, I cannot possibly fathom your loss, but I am so incredibly sorry. As others have stated, if you need a stranger to talk to, feel free to PM me and I’ll do my best to talk to you however you need.  [end]
[start] My son is a single ventricle, too, so I understand the emotional roller coaster you have been through to keep that precious little heart going. Teddy must have been a fighter to get all the way to the Fontan. I’m so sorry. No one should have to go through this. ((Heart hugs)) [end]
[start] I’m so sorry for your loss Sending prays and thoughts your way from Canada  ♥️ [end]
[start] I am so, so sorry for your loss. I’m a nurse and work in peds cardiac and this loss never gets easier for staff and I can’t begin to imagine the pain of the parents. Your son knew a life of love and you and your partner were able to give him that. I’m so sorry for your loss. I will be praying for you, your partner, and Teddy.  [end]
[start] I have you in my prayers. [end]
[start] Love and condolences from a girl in New Jersey. I can’t even begin to imagine your heartache. ❤️ [end]
[start] Add Australia ❤️ [end]
[start] This is absolutely heartbreaking. All my condolences for your loss  [end]
[start] A text message or comment may not mean much, and I cannot express my feelings that well but I will try. I would like to send my condolences from Canada, I am still in high school and I do not know any of the pain your going through, but I'm hoping you can move on. Im sorry this happened, but Teddy would probably want his father and mother to live happily even though he wouldn't be there to experience it. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry for your loss! We lost our only son in December. I will never be the same. I don’t even know that person, the person I was before I lost him. Just know you are not alone.  [end]
[start] I cannot even fathom your pain. I will pray God will send his angels to comfort you  [end]
[start] Lighting a candle tonight for Teddy ❤️  [end]
[start] He loved you  [end]
[start] My condolences to you and your partner, Rest In Peace Teddy ❣️ [end]
[start] Deepest condolences may the universe wrap you in peace. VIRGINIA  [end]
[start] **hug** [end]
[start] And a girl in SAo Paulo. So sorry  [end]
[start] All the way from the land down under, I am deeply sorry.  [end]
[start] A single mom from Upstate NY is wrapping you & your partner with thoughts of love, peace & strength. Rest amongst angels, sweet Teddy. [end]
[start] I am so very sorry for your loss. My son died of hlhs too - in 1999. Please find ways to let yourself mourn for as long as it takes and in whatever (healthy) ways you can- cry often and hard. The sobs that would come out of me were unlike anything I’d ever experienced before - I completely understood those images I’d seen of women in other cultures (middle eastern maybe?) who would just wail. Let yourself wail if you need to. Find other ways to help yourself cope too. For me it was journaling and scrapbooking and blogging and going to parent loss support groups. I also found out who my true friends were at that time. Some will get impatient with you as they won’t understand the depth of your pain but others will. I am so sorry you have to begin this painful journey but please know that some day you will smile again. Wishing you peace on this journey.  [end]
[start] My prayers from Pakistan to you and to your son Teddy.  [end]
[start] We lost our son last October. He was a month old. I know I can say that I’m sorry, or that you have my prayers and I know that doesn’t mean shit or help at all. I am here if you want to shoot us a DM.  Anything at all, whether it’s questions, or advice, or to talk about Teddy, or even if you don’t have the energy to go get dinner and you want me to order you a pizza. Also - Let your family & friends take care of you. [end]
[start] My heart goes out to you and your partner. May Teddy rest peacefully, and may you find your peace. Hugs.  [end]
[start] I’m so sorry.  Peace to you and your family. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry for your loss.  He was beautiful.   [end]
[start] I saw your picture you posted of your boy when he was born. He is a beautiful little boy. Please treasure these moments with him. One mother to another, I am thinking of you and sending all of my love.  [end]
[start] Oh honey, I don’t even have the words. My heart just breaks for you. Teddy was lucky to have so much love surrounding him right up until the end and even now. My 2 are sound asleep after a hard day and I find myself wanting to go and snuggle them now.   Thank you and Teddy for the reminder of how precious and fleeting this all is ❤️. I’ll light a candle for him. [end]
[start] i am so sorry for your loss. 😔❤️ [end]
[start] I’m so so sorry for your loss. Seeing the love and prayers from strangers all over the globe has given me a little faith in humanity. I didn’t know baby Teddy but he gave me an amazing gift just now. Faith is powerful. [end]
[start] I am so sorry for the loss of your sweet baby. My heart hurts for you and your partner. Big hugs and lots of love and prayers for comfort.  [end]
[start] There are no words for your pain. I’m so sorry, this is beyond devastating news, a parents’ worst nightmare. Sending love and prayers to you and your family. [end]
[start] You made an awesome little human. So glad he was here. I’m sorry he couldn’t stay 💔 [end]
[start] Holy shit I’m so sad rn  [end]
[start] Lel [end]
[start] Find comfort in all the love you gave him and will always have for him. ♥️ [end]
[start] I’m so sorry life handed you this tragedy.  I’ll be thinking of you and how you and your partner are holding up for a very long time.  I think all of us here will be.   [end]
[start] Some are too good to be here and to live this evil entrenched world.. love you Teddy, thanks for making a stop. I’ll be thinking of you, pray us down here.  [end]

[start] I don’t know you, but I’m so proud ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ [end]
[start] Ayyee!!! No it's my turn 😂😭😭 [end]
[start] Congratulations! From someone who's been there, I know its really difficult to do, and I commend your strength. [end]
[start] Be proud of yourself. It takes so much strength and bravery to escape a terrifying situation. You did it. You survived. I am so happy for you. [end]
[start] Congratulations, love. I understand that feeling.   Sending love to you for this new life you'll be entering.  💚💫 [end]
[start] NOT easy. Hella congratulations to you!!! [end]
[start] This is the shit I want to see on my feed more often.   Good job. [end]
[start] From one survivor to another; you got this. It's going to be hard in places, but you got this. NOTHING will EVER be harder than being in the 'relationship' (I use this term very loosely as those are not relationships those are dictatorships) and escaping from it. You. Got. This. Always. [end]
[start] Bravo [end]
[start] Gooooood!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ [end]
[start] Excellenté [end]
[start] Congratulations! [end]
[start] YESSS. Well done [end]

[start] Good job! [end]
[start] Congratulations! [end]
[start] New lease on life... Be happy! 😁 [end]
[start] Cheers to you [end]
[start] I don't care if you said you're not asking for attention, you deserve some! Proud of you ❤️ [end]
[start] Congrats!! You did something that takes hella strength and we are v proud of you [end]
[start] Congratulations!!! :) :D [end]
[start] Yay!! Congratulations!!! Now stay gone and have the faith that your next chapter will be full of joy, love, and freedom! [end]
[start] Yay! Enjoy your new found safety and freedom!! [end]
[start] *THIS DESERVES ATTENTION* [end]
[start] Well done you. Leaving is hard. Proud of you. [end]
[start] hell yeah 😭🎉 [end]
[start] Something more beautifull is waiting for you in future🙂 [end]
[start] Omg 🥳🎊✨💗CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!💗✨🎊 [end]
[start] FUCK. YES!! CONGRATULATIONS! As a survivor this makes me heart sore!   Whoever tried to bring you down is already beneath you! [end]
[start] Fuck yea, block that, don't be nice, keep it blocked...the universe will drop something/someone amazing at your feet...be open to recognizing and appreciate it. Don't be scared...believe in yourself and not the crap you've been told! [end]
[start] Congratulations!   Something people don't talk about is the withdrawal period.   You get addicted to the chemical your brain makes to survive the abuse. Your own mind will try its hardest to find reasons to go back off and on for a bit. It's just withdrawal from a drug that was killing you.   Also, be very careful. If you don't have a safety plan, feel free to pm me and we'll work on one.   And lastly.... you may find yourself wanting to know where they are and what they're doing. That is probably because your sense of safety is tied to your ability to read their emotions.   I've read all the books, all the blogs, watched all the videos and taken all the courses and classes available that I could find for people leaving abusive relationships. It took me 15.5 years to get out, and it's been 3.5 since.   If you have any questions and nobody to answer them, I would love to help. I never intend on needing this information for myself again. [end]
[start] I'm proud of you 💕 [end]
[start] God bless you, you have so much to be proud of. I have been there myself and I know what an achievement it is. The wonderful thing about it is you get to keep feeling like this every day and it’s going to keep getting better, and you are too! [end]
[start] Good job!  RIP your inbox tho [end]
[start] Good for you !!!!!! It’s amazing to see you have been through the process of recognizing and acting to change your life for the better. Go you! [end]
[start] Whenever you feel like sharing your story and how you were able to leave, we would honestly appreciate it! Congratulations my heart is extremely happy for you! And I hope you heal from all of it and become a stronger version of yourself. Lots of love! <3 [end]
[start] I don’t even know you and yet I am so genuinely proud of and happy for you for this 💙 [end]
[start] SO VERY PROUD OF YOU!   New beginnings are scary but exhilarating! [end]
[start] Congrats! [end]
[start] Act on your highest passion to the best you are able at every given moment without any insistence on the outcome. Act with integrity treating others as you would treat yourself. Love and light [end]
[start] Congratulations! I hope everything goes well for you from here on xo [end]
[start] Congrats [end]
[start] congratulations! [end]
[start] So happy for you! [end]
[start] Wow that's great. I'm happy for you, I'm sure it must have been so tough. All those arguments and drama. Now you're free to be yourself [end]
[start] Good job! It's really hard to walk out of a situation like this! I'm proud of you! [end]
[start] Two weeks ago my Ma finally filed the restraining order against her verbally abusive gaslighting ex. Happy for you! [end]
[start] Good!! I am so happy for you! Now that you're out, stay out! That is the hardest part immediately after the break up.   You've got this!! [end]
[start] First, I'm happy for you.   This could be a dangerous time for you. He may become desperate to see you again. Especially after a couple days without you.   I don't know your specific details, but abusers can become desperate and some of their most violent actions can occur when their victim attempts to leave the relationship. Even if he is locked up currently, watch out when he gets released. Make sure you have people looking out for you and that know he is not welcome around you. [end]
[start] Well done anything that was his/hers burn it [end]
[start] HalleluYahhhh 👏 [end]
[start] Hi! I'm very happy for you. This may not be your experience, but it was mine. So I want you to know that it's okay if you miss them. It's normal to feel this way. Just stay strong when it happens. Good luck 😙😊 [end]
[start] YESSSS GO GIRL YOU DID IT WE ARE ALL SO PROUD OF YOU!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩🤩. [end]
[start] Congratulations!!!! I hope you’re well, getting out of an abusive relationship can be a struggle, I hope your future is bright. [end]
[start] Scream out loud! We’ll scream with you!!! [end]
[start] Congratulations! This is truly amazing and takes a lot of strength!! Super happy for you!! <3 [end]
[start] I applaud you. I was in a very verbal, toxic abusive relationship a few years ago. Looking back I do not regret it. Unfortunately it took losing my mother for me to realize that I should have left her years ago. Kinda bittersweet in that aspect. [end]
[start] CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! [end]
[start] WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO [end]
[start] I'm SO beyond happy for you. I know how hard that can be, and I really can't stress enough how awesome that is. I hope you know how strong you are for surviving this, and also getting out of it. <3 [end]
[start] You deserve attention!! So proud of you <3 [end]
[start] that’s amazing sweetie! im proud. go out and live your life :) [end]
[start] Yessss!!! Congratulations!!!! [end]
[start] Sending my love and support! [end]
[start] please learn from this So many women don't learn from this and think they are worthless and it's easier to just stay in an abusive relationship [end]
[start] So proud of you!!💓 I know how hard it is to get out of an abusive relationship, so it is awesome to hear and I am thankful and happy that you got out of that situation! If you ever want/need to talk, I know I'm a stranger, but I can be a friend! lol [end]
[start]    better late than never [end]
[start] 3 months out from leaving a 4 year abusive relationship and I have never been happier. Congratulations!!!!! [end]
[start] Y’all are a little too gullible on here. [end]
[start] So proud of you!!! Keep moving forward!! Don’t look backwards [end]
[start] good for you..... [end]
[start] Congrats! Beginning of a new life ! [end]
[start] Awesome! well done 😁its so difficult to get out of a relationship of that sort. As you become brainwashed into thinking its a normal, when its actually far from it. You also begin to believe that you actually deserve what is happening to you.   Its the people who pull these stunts should be arrested for it, and shouldn't be allowed to be able to be around others. Let the healing comence. [end]
[start] i said slime im prada u!!!!!💓💓💓💓 sending love and best wishes u did what’s best for urself and that’s progressing i’m genuinely glad x <33 [end]
[start] I’m so proud of you!! [end]
[start] GOOD FOR YOU!!! I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT [end]
[start] A fist pump and hug for you WTG! [end]
[start] Way to go! Never look back! [end]
[start] not asking for attention but surrounding your post title with bright emojis? [end]
[start] Good for you [end]
[start] That’s awesome. Good for you. Took me 3 and a half to get out of one. You really begin to realize how bad things were when they’re gone too. [end]
[start] Fantasy! It took me 35 years and him killing my dogs before I left. Go be the best you ever! [end]
[start] Congratulations stay strong and live your life to the fullest ❤️ [end]
[start] Omg that’s great!!! I’m so happy to hear that and I hope you fine someone better for you! 😊 [end]
[start] Thank you all for the support!!!! I didnt expect so many of u would!!! 😭❤️  I would loved to share my story. But atm moment I’m still shaking. I’m afraid he will find this post and get to me.   But I will tell that he got caught doing drugs by the police. So I saw that as an opportunity to leave and  I did.  Once again Thank u !!! 😢❤️ i appreciate this so much. This show me that everything will work out at the end. And thank u for those who have shared your story. U are my heroes.  Bless you all. I love u deeply❤️ [end]
[start] I'm so proud of you! That takes a lot of courage and inner strength. I wish you healing ❤ [end]
[start] Congratulations ^-^ I hope you keep enjoying like that [end]
[start] CONGRATS GURL!!!  I ran into one of those. Wish I also ran out of one of those. Let’s just say I had to ghost real slow. It was awkward.  AND YOU MADE IT!!! [end]
[start] Scream it once again on our behalf. It's one life, one world. Wish you a lot of joy. [end]
[start] Took you long enough [end]
[start] Just for clarification, were you the abuser? Or your ex partner? [end]
[start] Wishing you the best [end]

[TITLE] My white friend punched a guy after he called me the n-word [TITLE]
[start] Your friend sounds pretty cool [end]
[start] True friends protect friends mate. In high school there was a buddy of mine that I saw getting picked on by someone else. Rushed over there and knocked that dude on his ass. Turns out this kid had been following my friend after class for a while, harassing him and bullying him because he was a nerd.   Good things happen when we look out for each other. Years later that very same friend came out to me before anyone else and we are still good friends even after 15 years. Hold onto your buddy! He sounds like a keeper. [end]
[start] Yo is your friend single?  Jokes aside, that's amazing. A lot of well-meaning allies just freeze in the moment and while it's not always willful, I do wish they'd take action more. [end]
[start] Don't ever let that friend go. This is an example of what it means to stand up for someone (he may have gone a bit far but sometimes too much is too much)  &#x200B;  in the wonderful words of Macklemore "We may not be the same but that's not important. No freedom till we're equal damn right I support it!" (yes I know this is song is about sexual orientation and the modern persecution of those who don't fit what is "normal" but this line works for many contexts) [end]
[start] Something in the way you said “I wasn’t even laughing that loudly” made me sad.  I need you to know that you are allowed to exist and to laugh however you want without being harassed for it. You do NOT have to be less of yourself for the comfort of others. [end]
[start] That’s awesome. I’ve seen so many professed allies of minority groups who talk the right way but balk when direct action is needed, including my younger self. It’s one thing to believe in equality. It’s another for a privileged person to put their own ass on the line for it, [end]
[start] He did nothing wrong. I'm glad you have someone like him in your life. [end]
[start] This is fantastic.  When I was about 14, my best friend (black) and I (white) were at a fair and out of nowhere someone came up to her and told her to "go back to Africa with the rest of the n-words."  I was on crutches at the time since I just had knee surgery and I promptly walked up to the asshole and thwapped her upside the head with my crutch.    Don't fuck with my people. [end]
[start] This dude sounds like the man that should be making the best man speech at your future wedding. [end]
[start] My brother punched a coworker at a holiday party for saying the n-word. He got fired. [end]
[start] I wish I was there to see it.. boy would that be satisfying. [end]
[start] You have an awesome friend keep him forever [end]
[start] He's a keeper. [end]
[start] Good friend. I need some of those. [end]
[start] This is so wholesome. Not only for the punching of a racist, but also for the fact that it added a layer of depth to your friendship. I love it!! [end]
[start] Literally a white knight. [end]
[start] Nowadays, is very rare to see people defending black persons when some trolls in the internet called you an N word. Your friend is the best and treasure him while you can [end]
[start] Nice! Your friend assaulted someone. [end]
[start] I probably wouldn't have punched the guy, but I probably would have said something along the lines of *"Fuck off you dirty, drunk hobo. What makes you think your opinion holds even a shred of value?"* [end]
[start] "Because that's what heroes do" [end]
[start] While calling people names is juvenile, assault is even worse & punishable by law.  2 wrongs don't make a right, ever. Que the brigade in 3..2.. [end]
[start] People love violence so of course they will approve of that.  But you shouldn't escalate the situation like that.  Someone saying a bad word doesn't give you the right to assault them. [end]
[start] One of my close friends is black. I'm white. My daughter knows him as her uncle, there's nothing I wouldn't do for him, and I'm sure the feeling is mutual. I refer to him as a brother, because I feel you don't need to share DNA to be family, never have. I honestly would do the same if someone said that to him. Because he doesn't deserve that ugliness of being denigrated. He's someone to look up to. He's a beacon of amazing character and what people should strive to be. He's someone I trust with my life. He's family. So yes, I would defend him 10/10 without even thinking about it.   Your friend is a true friend, OP. [end]
[start] Everyone should be lucky enough to have a friend like yours. [end]
[start] Well done your friend, and well done you to have a friend that back you up [end]
[start] This is what a good ally looks like. Well, minus the violence, but the way that he so completely backed you up, that's what a good ally and a good friend does. [end]
[start] Nice LARP [end]
[start] you're friend is what the word means, a FRIEND.      Really nice person you've got there, hang on to him! [end]
[start] So, your friend calls you the n-word and then punches a guy... and you're still friends? [end]
[start] My only issue is that he jumped the guy immediately. I would have called him on it and told him to apologize if he didn't want an ass beating. [end]
[start] It is a very dangerous precedent to decide you can violently assault someone if you decide what they said was immoral.  Some people have different ideas of what is moral. I think the guy was an asshole but you said yourself he was a drunk with a bottle. Beating a drunk for saying dumb shit is not going to work out. Most drunks say dumb shit. I fought a lot when I was young. For ANY perceived slight. Whether it was intentional or not. It took years and painful lessons to learn that, hitting someone does not change them or help you. In fact, it just lowers you to their level.  You can't have a society running amok using violence as vigilante justice for saying shitty things. [end]
[start] r/thathappened [end]
[start] I am really glad you have a friend you know values you and loves you.  But also, violence is not the answer. If a cop was near by, or the punch hit the wrong spot (plus blood thinning effect however mild while drinking) could have led to a very bad outcome for your friend.  That said, I tend to freeze and or slow to process so I hope I can at least be as fast thinking if I am ever in a similar situation. [end]
[start] I mean that's cool that he's willing to stand up for you, but am I the only one that thinks that beating up a homeless guy isn't commendable? There's a 99% chance the guy had mental health issues. My city has its fair share of dudes like that who will spout sexist and racist slurs at everyone who walks by them, but generally you learn to just ignore them. [end]
[start] A good riend for sure, but he should know that punching someone could get him prosecuted and in jail. Not only that, people have died from a single punch.  It's cool that he was brave to defend your name, but you wouldn't be so happy and neither would he if he got in serious trouble for it. [end]
[start] We can take insult ourselves but it's harder to watch a friend be insulted.   I'm glad you both were ok. [end]
[start] Good [end]
[start] I was in the park a few weekends ago trying to re-learn how to skateboard.  I truly suck at it now. There was a group of teens there and a couple of them kept laughing and calling me a honkey.  They were black kids and were wearing shirts from a nearby private school. Upper middle class kids. I just laughed. Honkey is a pretty funny word even when the person saying it is a racist.  I was raised to judge people on their character and not how much melanin they have in their skin.  It just seems ... simple minded.   I guess I don’t see the point of being violent about a word.  It’s nice that your friend stuck up for you but really, was his response productive in any way?  Some drunk asshole called you a name. Rise above that shit. [end]
[start] >He’s genuinely one of the nicest people I know and I would never associate him with any violent outbursts.  What seems like a contradiction on first glance is actually just a nicest person you know, not standing for a very unkind thing happening to his friend. Completely in line with his character. [end]
[start] r/humansbeingbros    Your friend is the best kind of friend. You two deserve each other in the best way. [end]
[start] That's a real friend [end]
[start] I wish there were more people like your friend. Thanks for sharing the nice anecdote. [end]
[start] I’m just glad he wasn’t sued! What a good friend you have! [end]
[start] I was so confused at first, by the title i thought your friend was a scumbag who called you an n-word and also punched a guy [end]
[start] That's a true friend [end]
[start] I’m doing the same think if this happens and I’m out with one of my black friends. Standing up to the real racial injustices in this country is something we should all strive to do.  Proud to say one of my sons cold cocked a kid who called his friend the N word. [end]
[start] Sounds like a trade unionist I know who got arrested for assault after punching out a guy who made a comment about his aboriginal mate. Christy Cain, good bloke, look him up. [end]
[start] Its really hard to find a friend that will do that for you this days. Keep that friend of yours. He is a blessing. 😊 [end]
[start] Even bad things can have good outcomes. :)  Your friend sounds awesome. [end]
[start] I'm sorry, but I HATE those ignorant patronizing displays of concern. Why doesn't always just kick over the tombstones of his dead great grandparents, and their parents, and so on? Certain they probably did worse. [end]
[start] What a fucking champ. [end]
[start] He earned a free pass to the BBQ now.... [end]
[start] Yo, if your other white friends don't do shit like that 👏🏾 drop 👏🏾 them. [end]
[start] Good friend. Hearing this is heartwarming :) [end]
[start] what a guy [end]
[start] What a sweet gift. To find out in a tangible way that a friend really does have your back. [end]
[start] Good friend. [end]
[start] That’s a friend [end]
[start] Lemme quess, everyone clapped? [end]
[start] I need a black friend to punch someone for.  I guess I have some, but nobody I'm around is dropping the N bomb.  I just wanna punch someone righteously, you know? [end]
[start] Sounds like a made up story yet again. [end]
[start] Your friend will probably kindly return the n word pass even if you gave it to him. What a bro. [end]
[start] Now that’s what a real friend is all about. [end]
[start] I appreciate that your friend stood up for you ! If you would have done it for yourself it would have played into that racist man's stereotype. the other thing that stood out to me while reading your story was how you felt that you had to point out that you were in a public park with other people and kids being loud. I am sorry that you felt that you needed to qualify that.  I hope you have many more friends that would stand up for you! [end]
[start] Your friend is a true friend. I was raised by parents that taught us that there is no difference between a person of color and us. We are all humans and we love one another and treat other people who you would like to be treated. I've had aunts, uncles, and cousins who are black but that never played a role in how we treated them. [end]
[start] Your friend may be a super hero 😂 [end]
[start] Love your story... love the friendship... love the brotherhood. It's a shame that it took the issue of race to show just how much race doesn't matter if two people really like and respect one another. As a former military guy and a person who has had a diverse range of friends, I can tell you that I have been in similar situations... and those stories have stayed in my head for years.  Your story is both a fond reminder and reinforcement of this portion of my personal soundtrack. Thank you for that. [end]
[start] Laugh as loud as you want no matter where you are💖 [end]
[start] Nice! [end]
[start] Not all hero's wear capes [end]
[start] One girl in our friend group in middle school bought the last copy of a long-awaited game from our local store after our mutual push over friend told all of us about how he found it at the store and was going to pick it up after school....  When I found out what she did, I gave her hell. The push over friend was trying to shrug it off but he ended up crying after he found out what happened (he'd been waiting a LONG time for that game). I found the girl and I let her have it (just telling her off for being a horrible friend and human being) and made her give the game to our mutual friend for free.   I hate people who take advantage of the weak. It's just so low. [end]
[start] This should not be as uncommon as it seems to be. It should be commonplace when someone calls another out of their name, when a woman gets groped, when someone weaker gets bullied.  We should always stand up for those who need it. [end]
[start] He sounds like an amazing friend. [end]
[start] Dope [end]
[start] Awesome friend! Is his hand alright though? [end]
[start] Your friend seems more like a hero. I'm glad you have someone who cares for you, its important in life to find true friends. [end]
[start] You and your friend give me hope! Thank you! The race issue has become so bad lately (last several years) and I know I am terrified of insulting someone I care about! God forbid, I be daft enough, not to notice.   My best friend is a gay man. I am a straight woman. We have been through some interesting situations here in the south! Lol! I will kill for my friend. He is the greatest guy I know other than my daddy and hubby, so that’s saying something. I hate when people use race as an excuse for behavior.   Your friend is a great guy for standing up for you and you must be, too for not beating your friend to it! [end]
[start] Good friend! Hopefully the asshole learned a lesson. [end]
[start] That's assault. Fuck your feelings. That guy was right because you stood there while your friend hit him [end]
[start] This kinda sounds like a made up story by someone who's seen too many marvel movies. And it's plainly idiotic, in a black and white way, to praise any sort of violence. Civility is always the right choice. [end]
[start] I would've grabbed the bottle and shoved it up his ass, no joke Haha no one ever under my presence will mistreat my family or friends, they will know exactly how the gates of hell sound like when they are opening. [end]
[start] The real question is: does your friend get the N word pass now lmao jk [end]
[start] You a Female or Male? [end]
[TITLE] Just had an unbelievably kick ass 12 hour first date [TITLE]
[start] Just reading that lifted my mood. I hope you have an amazing day and thanks for posting :) [end]
[start] Aww this is so cute! Congrats you found someone you can stand to be around for 12hrs straight that is a challenge! Seriously, really big challenge [end]
[start] So happy for you! [end]
[start] Sounds like you made a great connection and you did a great job planning an awesome date! [end]
[start] All I can think of when you say "blacklight pajama bowling party" is an absolute ocean of telltale jizz stains [end]
[start] The only guy I went on a 12 hour date with, I married. Almost 20 years ago! [end]
[start] That sounds really sweet. How'd you guys meet?   Sounds like there's a lot of energy there, so I think you've found something special! Makes me actually want to get back into the dating scene haha [end]
[start] So happy for you man! Hope it keeps getting better for you :) [end]
[start] Don’t know anything about you, but just the mention of Tipper makes me think we’d be friends. You have good taste, homie. [end]
[start] The energy in this post alone made my spirits high... So happy for you OP! [end]
[start] Love the trip hop Tipper mention in this lol [end]
[start] Damn. Even a 2.5-hour date sounds exhausting to me because of constant human interaction. Congrats. [end]
[start] This sounds fantastic. Y'all have an opportunity to have a partner in crime for adventure and good food. Dating isn't my strong point so I always advise others to enjoy the ride and see where it takes you. [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing!! This put a smile on my face. I hope y’all have more great dates :) [end]
[start] Nice! My marriage started off as a kickass 12 hour date! Good luck! [end]
[start] Upvoted for Tipper. Glad you had a great time too! [end]
[start] I hope she likes Tipper [end]
[start] How much did you spend? Legit question. [end]
[start] Gwan my guy! [end]
[start] Congrats on a killer first date! [end]
[start] Sounds like a lot of fun, happy for you OP! [end]
[start] This made me smile :) sounds like an awesome day let alone date [end]
[start] Now that's a great connection between two souls! [end]
[start] I love everything about this! I'm no longer in Chicago, and I often feel like I MUST be misremembering how amazingly *good* it was there, but stories like these reaffirm - it really is a wonderful place to just be with other people. I'm so glad you had a delightfully full day with what sounds to be an incredibly cool person, and I genuinely hope great things for you both! Keep us all posted on your adventures together! [end]
[start] Bravo, zelim ti sve najlepse :) [end]
[start] Had to do a double take to see what subreddit I was in when you mentioned Tipper. Absolutely love Tipper, we just were in NOLA for his three night run and it was beautiful. Was really upset that his plans for a Chicago run fell through, would really like another excuse to come visit.      Congrats on your first date! [end]
[start] congrats fellow Serbian, hope it turns out even better [end]
[start] must be full as fuck lol [end]
[start] Homie I don’t know you but I salute you, I’m proud [end]
[start] Awesome! It's so great when you just Click with someone like that [end]
[start] Me and my bf had a 12 hour “first date” and we’ve now been together a year and moved in together after 2 months as we saw each other everyday!! I wish you all the best and hope it turns out amazing!! [end]
[start] I loved reading this, it sounds like you had a wonderful evening and so did she! [end]
[start] Well done lad sounds fun time flys when your having fun. [end]
[start] Sounds like a good time if I ever heard one. You earned it. [end]
[start] You did an amazing job planning this date!! I hope you have many more special times together ahead of you. [end]
[start] Beograd bureks were my jam! Do they still make the sugar doughnuts on the weekends? [end]
[start] After a few shitty weeks, this sounds like the best thing to happen, I am happy for you! [end]
[start] Bro what a baller!! I love hearing about awesome times likes these. keep the vibes going my man!! Super happy for you! [end]
[start] All of these activities are too expensive for me as a college student. I’m glad you guys had a good time! That sounds amazing [end]
[start] Makes one want to go to Chicago! [end]
[start] what bowling alley did you go to? [end]
[start] This is how my first date with my husband started! We had a plan to get coffee & take a walk, but it turned into an unexpectedly long hike, then drinks, then dinner, then a movie and a walk.... Good luck and may your future dates be as exciting.  I wish I could relive those first few months! [end]
[start] I hope I have a similarly successful date with the girl I'm pursuing lol [end]
[start] Love this! [end]
[start] I can bet you you’ll be feeling butterflies every time you see this girl. [end]
[start] God bless cevaps [end]
[start] Sounds absolutely amazing. Now I wish I had that DJ's track list, looove chill trip hop! If anyone wants to, I'd be glad to get some recommendations [end]
[start] Joga i ćevapi for the win! Sretno na drugom dejtu 😊😊 [end]
[start] I know its not the point of the story but In curious, do you know what Trip Hop they played? Its one of my fav genres and Im always looking for new stuff [end]
[start] Majstore [end]
[start] Svaka čast za čevape! Sretno! [end]
[start]  this is like outta a movie. happy for you!! [end]
[start] svaka cast zmaju kakvi su bili cevapi [end]
[start] Wow, this made me happy, congrats dudeee [end]
[start] AAA++++++ in date planning!! [end]
[start] This is really great. Although committing to doing something for 4 months together on the first date seems a little fast. Unless you're a lesbian. In which case things are going slow.   Just kidding (kind of). I'm glad this worked out. Where did you meet her? [end]
[start] How do you plan dates like this?!  For me it’s like all I’ve got in the bag is dinner at a nice place.  I’m so boring haha [end]
[start] Myman! [end]
[start] Oh my god if a guy took me on a date to get cevaps, I would be so happy I wouldn’t know what to do with myself 😍 [end]
[start] I thought this was going to turn out to be a fiction designed to highlight the wonderful things our nation’s diversity affords us, but I’m so happy it’s a real experience you got to have!  I hope there are many more like it in your future. [end]
[start] That's awesome! Just a bit curious had u ever meet before u picked her up? I'm asking because I have a date next weekend and dunno if i should offer to pick her up or not (we haven't met, it would be our first time) and i don't want it to be awkward [end]
[start] This sounds like the best day ever [end]
[start] Tipper style? I’m in [end]
[start] Actually funny, I also had a 12 hour date, it was a first for me but by far mine was so simple compared to yours I am even a little jealous of how wholesome your date appears to be.  I hope everything goes well and that you can have a blast during the next times as well and honestly congrats haha :) [end]
[start] r/thathappened [end]
[start] Not gonna lie, read the one line as "never been to the studio. *very horny* welcoming with a great lavender aroma" I was like damn this is gonna be a long 12 hours! But props. That is amazing sounds like a great time!!! And I hope you have many more. Cheers mate. [end]
[start] Yessss!!! I def ship for you two!! [end]
[start] > The dj was spinning some awesome chill trip hop. Tipper style. DJs were killing it with the breakbeats.  Uh oh. I think getting old. I don't understand what any of this means. [end]
[start] I think it's an ad [end]
[start] Sounds amazing! [end]
[start] That sounds amazing. Good job! [end]
[start] This sounds like my perfect date. Mindy’s is the best [end]
[start] Oh, to be young again! You got me at the "got there at 9:30... A bit early but..." Lol that's late looking like bed time to me. I'm so old now! [end]
[start] Was the bar Berlin? Also I gotta check out that Cevap spot now [end]
[start] That sounds like such a fun date. Best wishes to you both in the future. [end]
[start] This is awesome! Hope you guys keep it going! [end]
[start] This sounds like an incredible time. Happy for you! [end]
[start] Dude so happy for you, congrats. Live the dream [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] This is cute as hell :,) [end]
[start] Please let us know how date 2+ goes! [end]
[start] What is ' Tipper style'? [end]
[start] She´s the one bro [end]
[start] hello, fellow chicagoan! keep us updated! what studio did you go to? [end]
[start] that sounds like an amazing date! [end]
[start] Mindy's is soooooo good!   Congrats on the good time :) [end]
[start] Uh, yah, that sounds like a pretty amazing date to me! 🥘 🎶 🧘‍♀️ [end]
[start] Why 12 hours? [end]
[start] Great job dude! [end]
[start] Sounds like you made a real friend! [end]
[start] wonderful! [end]
[start] Congrats on your date! Sounds like it just click with her. And having cevapcici for your first dinner is pretty cool! [end]
[start] Being fun and having fun for 12 hours is a major flex! 💪 [end]
[start] So excited for you !  What a nice post to start of my day :)) [end]
[start] Loved reading this and got even more excited when I knew the places you were mentioning! I live by Charlie’s and hoping you went to Salsita - love it! Hope it continues!! [end]
[start] Youre lucky af [end]
[start] Nice dude... wish it was as easy with guys... how did you meet her? [end]
[start] Posts like this make connecting with other people look so easy. [end]
[start] I just had a break up and I’m kinda sad, but fucking good for you man! Keep it up [end]
[start] My second date with my boyfriend lasted almost 70 hours. We’re now engaged. :) [end]
[start] Please tell me you're a lesbian and eating tacos was a euphemism for a reallllly good first date. [end]
[start] How do you even meet women? Where do you go? I’m 30 and dateless [end]
[start] Did she end up eating your cevap? Good job brother [end]
[start] She's going to ghost you. [end]
[start] *In the other post*... "I went on a date with a guy and spent 12 hours with him and he didn't put out! It was pretty obvious from the first few minutes, so I though whatever if I talk he might engage but it lasted all day! Never doing that again!" [end]
[start] Who boy is that ever limerence in full swing... [end]
[start] Did you fuck tho? [end]
[TITLE] I am a teacher. If your child is doing school work at home in the coming weeks and you’re struggling please feel free to ask someone else as I want to watch every season of The Wire. [TITLE]
[start] Totally understandable, but by the end of season 4 you'll be wishing you could do more to help the kids.      Edit: autocorrect [end]
[start] My school district is assigning 6 hours of work to us everyday that we have to log 😑 [end]
[start] As a teacher who has already seen The Wire, please ask me.  &#x200B;  I'm a HS science teacher, hit me up if yall need anything. [end]
[start] I live in Baltimore. Every day IS the wire [end]
[start] I grew up a few minutes from the West Side of Baltimore where most of The Wire was filmed. Feel free to ask me anything you want to know. This show was quite an accurate depiction of Baltimore.  PS. McNulty and Bunk were Comedic Gold in many scenes! [end]
[start] The Wire is amazing and worth another watch! [end]
[start] The Wire is def a top 2 show for me, I struggle when it comes to choosing between The Wire and The Sopranos.      Omar is my fav char by a long shot. [end]
[start] Omar comin’! [end]
[start] I have a first grader. Do you think it's actually important to do much schoolwork during this time, or should we just hang out and read books and play? [end]
[start] LMAO, At least you're honest. [end]
[start] Apparently a lot of people in here didn’t pay attention when their ELA teachers taught sarcasm. [end]
[start] I haven't even started doing the 100 pages of homework my kid's teacher has sent him. Of course, he is only 4 years old and still in Pre-K. I am a single mom who STILL has to report to work until tomorrow when they FINALLY send us to work from home. My retired father does not have the patience to deal with my kid. He is anxiously waiting for me to start working from home. Thankfully, his teacher is very understanding but still. I hate how all schools still assume every kid lives with two parents and that they also have a parent who stays home. Most of us fucking work SORRY we weren't lucky enough to be stay at home parents ugh ugh ugh So I totally understand your frustration! They don't pay you teachers enough for this crap lol [end]
[start] Quarrtining does not mean that we don’t have to work. This is not a “vacation” to binge watch tv. Your students still need you to support them in their learning experience. Parents may feel a little lost with how to help their children. It is your job to be assisting them in this strange transition. From one teacher to another, do better. Your students deserve it. [end]
[start] I get you feel disrespected, but it’s not the kids fault. Remember why you should have got into teaching. This is the most crucial time to continue with that spirit, when it’s not easy. This disease could have long term effects on kids development as well as psychology. [end]
[start] I (an educator) can’t express how deeply I resonate with this after the 30+ identical Facebook posts from my educator friends. “I am a teacher. If your child is working remotely and you are struggling please reach out, I’m certified in blah blah blah.” I’m on spring break y’all, call me Monday between 8am and 5pm [end]
[start] The only problem I have is that my spring break end this week, and we're supposed to head back, yet I have no idea what I'm doing for instruction. [end]
[start] It’s all in the game, yo [end]
[start] Enjoy it, such a great show! [end]
[start] A great example of why school systems suck in general. [end]
[start] Ahhh ik its supposed to be a joke but.... you're a teacher?? You cant be serious like all these people are still working out here. You still have to teach the fucking kids you know that right? I really hope you're just kidding and don't mean this but you never know now a days and idk this kinda made me feel a certain type of way. [end]
[start] What is the wire? [end]
[start] Yes thank you. Geeze can't even have a pandemic without being expected to go above and beyond, for the kids! [end]
[start] That was my binge watching during bed rest. Well one of my shows. [end]
[start] I haven't seen *The Wire*, but I did watch *[Treme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treme_\(TV_series\))*, which I understand was made by the same producer and lead writer and had at least one actor in common (Wendell Pierce). *Treme* is probably my third favorite series, after *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul*.  I did watch the opening episode of *The Wire*, but it didn't grab me, so I didn't continue. Maybe I should try again. [end]
[start] Definitely better than heading to downtown Baltimore.. [end]
[start] You had me in the first half, not gonna lie. [end]
[start] No one will blame you if you skip season 2. [end]
[start] After you finish The Wire then watch Treme and then Generation Kill. David Simon does not mess around with his dramas. The Duece is up there too but I'm having a hard time with how dark that one can get. Next will be The Plot Against America. [end]
[start] Totally get it. I fell hard for  Idris Elba in 2002. [end]
[start] Coys [end]
[start] At my school we finished today. It was so sudden and I feel so lost, it’s just over, no exams. It all kind of feels like a waste of time now and it’s really getting me down [end]
[start] Don’t spoil it for me I’m only on season 2 [end]
[start] Greatest of all time.  Watch The Americans next! [end]
[start] i don't mind helping the people out, they can message or pm me for help [end]
[start] We deserve it. 🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️💅🏾 [end]
[start] I am a doctor. If your child is feeling ill, please seek help elsewhere as I want to watch a TV show during a time of crisis where people might actually need my help. [end]
[start] I hate Kima, Lester  and Bubbles. Bodie and Clay Davis are the *Shiiiiiiiiiittttt!* [end]
[start] I’ve given up with anything meaningful to teach them in the next two weeks. We’re mid move to another neighboring county 30 minutes away and I just can’t keep fighting them to focus and pack at the same time. [end]
[start] When you walk through the garden... [end]
[start] Teaching is a hard and often thankless job. But this sentiment leaves me feeling the same way I felt when I saw people hoarding toilet paper, disappointed. [end]
[start] Sounds like you should find a different profession. My kids teachers are all reaching out to us to help them continue to learn during their time at home. It's looking like school won't be back in session until after summer. [end]
[start] ahahahahaha  Here I am emailing and texting and figuring out online lessons... [end]
[start] Gavin was right after all. [end]
[start] Please post this in r/funny. My mother and I just died laughing 🤣🤣🤣 [end]
[start] LOL [end]
[start] Lol [end]
[start] Well teacher ur a useless man and ur not doing ur students well [end]
[start] You are probably an awful teacher then. Smh. [end]
[start] LAD!  Omar dies... [end]
[start] What season? [end]
[start] "Teachers are underappreciated."  lol  /s [end]
[start] Woof [end]
[start] Your username fits you perfectly, bc you’re a total dick :) I understand that it is “quarantining” and I accidentally replaced two letters with another. I feel sad for you that that is the only thing you have to say in this conversation. Bless your heart, grammar nazi. [end]
[start] that's why people don't like most of their teachers. can't even help them to understand a concept [end]
[start] Rose comes back. Jimmy dies.           Now you can do other things :) [end]
[start] I’m guessing you are expecting to be paid as if you are teaching. [end]
[start] Too bad you have a job to do. [end]
[TITLE] I'm sorry Mr. Obama [TITLE]
[start] That's big of you, honestly. Making a mistake, acknowledging it and even going public.  Congratulations my friend. [end]
[start] I think people who want to make abortions illegal are on the wrong track, if stopping abortions is the end goal then making it illegal does not stop them.  A much better alternative is better education and access to contraceptives. [end]
[start] I am not a Republican but I am fine if you believe in God and your right to worship as you like should be protected. I think we can also agree that nobody goes out of their way to get an abortion for the thrill of it, so we can work together to help women  and girls avoid unwanted pregnancy. I will anyways believe that they have the final say about their own bodies though. I don't think this should separate your goals from mine completely... there is a lot of work to do right now and with climate change bearing down on us the stakes are higher than they've ever been. [end]
[start] To be fair there are a lot of my friends who are Democrats who are pro life and believe in god. I believe in god albeit I’m pro choice, but my pro choice line isn’t as aggressive as the party itself. I just believe that some women should have the option and a safe option where it’s not illegal and leads them to seek out some back alley infection spore.  Also, no reason you have to be a democrat. You can choose to be unaffiliated or a libertarian (I know a few of those too and they are lovely and interesting folk.)   The world is made up of so many options and so many accepting people in all parties. Having someone like Trump in office just makes us all think we have to be more strict in who we are because we just have to be offended all the time about the other party. But in reality most beliefs and political ideologies are more fluid. [end]
[start] Is this real? [end]
[start] I am proud of you for challenging your thought pattern when you saw that it was problematic, it's not easy for anyone to do that (regardless of party lines). Thank you for rising to that challenge.   I truly wish you the best, and I wish more people were as brave as you! [end]
[start] I long for the day when we have more than two legitimate parties.  The big tent philosophies of the Democratic and Republican parties makes strange and awful bedfellows.  But I fear that’s a pipe dream. [end]
[start] Vote on your morals not your affiliation. [end]
[start] It takes a LOT to recognize this kind of thing, and to follow through with your questions and concerns. Im really proud of you! Whoever you vote for in the future, you can now proudly say that you vited with your conscience. [end]
[start] Thank you for your thoughtfulness and attention. People like you help make America - and humanity - beautiful. [end]
[start] Sometimes i just feel bad for you Americans having to deal with a two party system. As a Dutch person who can vote on a ton of different parties I just look at the politics in the US and think: my god this is not how i would want my democracy to work. [end]
[start] That’s big of you to admit! Kudos! [end]
[start] Thought this was on r/copypasta because of the title lol [end]
[start] This give me hope that my more conservative friends will see we have more to gain together than divided by the system.  It realy can be difficult not getting swept up in dogma, especially in such a polarized age [end]
[start] There is nothing more difficult than taking an honest inventory, and coming to the conclusion that we have been wrong.   I think much of life’s problems stems from that fundamental inability of most people. To simply admit to being wrong, or even the possibility of being wrong. To rethink things that you’ve already made decisions about, and to course correct.   You should be very proud of yourself for doing what so few could. [end]
[start] I admire your willingness to other perspectives and Open mindedness to change your views. [end]
[start] Takes a big man to say he's *been* wrong, and is changing his ways.  Yeah, even anonymously. [end]
[start] I recommend giving the bible a good read. See how many times it mentions abortion vs caring for your fellow man.   The republicans are a lot like the pharisees that jesus railed against. Do not be yoked by their words, but look at their actions. They are hypocrites using your faith to control you and pretend they are are holy. [end]
[start] > Likewise, it is no longer acceptable to dismiss so much of the Democratic party simply because they do not agree with two ideals that are very important to me.  As someone non-religious, I'd just like to point out that like 99% of Democrats are just as Christian as you are. [end]
[start] I'm (genuinely) curious to know why you think that believing in God is inherently Republican?  I feel as though Republicans for years have been saying that Democrats are trying to extinguish religion, but I think that's because Democrats try and keep religion out of the political process/lawmaking (as the founders intended) and because the Democratic party is more diverse than the Republican party, they're not all Christians and thus have been branded as less "American."  &#x200B;  Regarding abortions, I'm curious to hear your stance on bodily autonomy.  Republicans continue to pass laws that don't allow women to have abortions, but allow leftover IVF embryos to be destroyed, which would support the argument that Republicans are more interested in controlling women's bodies than preserving an unborn embryo/fetus.  I'm also curious to know if you are against abstinence-only education, and what your stance is on universal pre-K, funding early childhood education, nutrition programs, welfare, etc.  It appears to many of us on the left that the Republican pro-life talking point is disingenuous - that they want to force women to carry all pregnancies to term, and then want to take away any possible assistance for that child once they're born.  &#x200B;  I hope my comments have been even-keeled, and that you do take the time to respond.  I enjoy engaging with people of a different political view than mine, as long as their thoughts are considered.  Thank you for your comments and for being civil. [end]
[start] Hey OP, that’s a big step.  You can believe in God and be Pro-Life if that’s what you feel strongly about.   Me personally, I’m religious and am Pro-Choice, and a Democrat.  Being Pro-Choice doesn’t make me Pro Abortion. It’s me acknowledging that sometimes in life, things happen, and a woman should be able to decide what’s best for HER without my opinion being involved in the matter.  But I digress.   Thanks for being so honest. Continue growing. We are all growing together and hopefully we can clean up this mess together as well. [end]
[start] People can call me out for promoting my favorite candidate but you might like Andrew Yang. [end]
[start] Just this administration has made you ashamed to be a republican? [end]
[start] Most liberals would like to see abortions be exceedingly rare. Just like you. We just maybe disagree on the best way to achieve that goal. [end]
[start] It takes a real man/woman to admit they are wrong and their mistakes. [end]
[start] Just fyi   Some states registering independent means you cannot vote in primary elections.  It might be better to stay registered Republican or register democrat  and just vote against republicans during actual elections. [end]
[start] That’s cool that you are acknowledging this.... but just throwing it out there.... you know libs aren’t a bunch of heathenistic atheists looking to abort all the babies right?  I’m a lib. And sure I’m pro choice. Actually I’m very pro choice, however, I don’t think I personally would get an abortion unless the situation absolutely necessitated it. I also believe in God (although my bf is an atheist and I completely understand why.) but I’m also Jewish, so I guess I don’t count in the republicans eyes as a true god fearin American!   Quite frankly, it doesn’t really seem like the Republican Party is upholding a strong belief in God these days either..... [end]
[start] This is the kind of ex-Trump voter we should embrace. [end]
[start] Good for you. Your self-reflection and honesty with yourself and others is admirable. [end]
[start] First of all, congratulations on your moment of clarity. Opening your eyes to different points of view can be difficult, you've taken the first step.  I think you are mistaken that left-wing/Democrats (FYI: these two are not mutually exclusive) don't generally believe in God or are pro-life. Fox News has convinced you that all Democrats are Atheist Heathens who want to destroy Religion and disproved God. Nothing is farther from the truth. Many Left-wing people are highly spiritual, involved in their churches, etc. They just feel that these are personal choices and are not trying to ram their beliefs down other people's throats. As far as pro-life, we believe in what Bill Clinton wanted abortion to be: "safe, legal, and RARE." A women/couple with a stable financial outlook and supportive family and community is vastly less likely to choose to abort, and the myth of women using abortion as a birth control device is laughable, especially when forms of birth control are so cheap, plentiful, and accessible. No, the right's anti-abortion stances are more rooted in punishment of women for having sex without intent of procreation rather than any interest in the welfare of the baby, which is proven by the right's opposition to funding programs to help the baby and mother post-birth. [end]
[start] You could have a greater impact by staying as a Republican, but only voting for Republicans who aren't batshit crazy (kinda impossible right now, but hopefully those days will come again... ). If you prefer the philosophy of governance, I'd suggest it's better to stay in the party and try to make it better. You can still vote for Democrats. The only real difference party affiliation is voting in primaries, and that's not even always the case.  But bottom line is you don't have to be a Democrat to vote for Democrats. You should always vote for the best available candidate, though at this moment I'm unaware of any examples where the Democrat isn't the better option. [end]
[start] While you may identify as Independent, I do recommend registering as a Democrat so you can vote in the Democratic primary. As a registered Rep that is what I plan on doing for 2020. I'm finding hope in the lot of candidates running for the Dem nomination and am looking for representation through them. Maybe you'll find the same thing. Best of luck. [end]
[start] Just remember Republicans are only pro-life until their mistress gets pregnant. [end]
[start] This is old news. Thanks for catching up [end]
[start] I recently had this realization as well and changed my party to independent 2 weeks ago. [end]
[start] American Independent Party is a political party in it's own right.  It doesn't mean that you are voting independently for whomever you want.    It means that you believe in the Independent party philosophy and in their particular candidates.    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Independent\_Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Independent_Party)  It is a far right party.    It's most famous candidate was Geo. Wallace who blocked blacks from University of Alabama.  Is that really who you are for? [end]
[start] Thank you for looking inside yourself and realizing what is truly important. Even though we may not agree on everything, we agree on more than you realize if we could sit and actually have a real conversation. Compromise is indeed truly an art. Peace to you.... [end]
[start] I love when people make logical decisions outside of their parties. Makes me feel like logic comes above blind loyalty which I appreciate. [end]
[start] I wish my parents could be as mature as you [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] This smells of “I want silver” [end]
[start] politics was never about which party. like our first president said, a bi-party system will only divide the nation, and make matters worse as the division grows.   we should all stick to our principles, yes, but at the same time we should all remember that politics is not about the party or the candidate. It has always been about we the people.   we created a democracy, we are obligated to defend which we have created. we are also burdened with the duty to establish and use our rights as a part of that democracy. we shiuld look to improve ourselves, debate, and make the decision that can make America better, stronger, and healthier.   OP, this is a good thing for you as you have learned to look past the bias you hold. I am a liberal, and i hold on to my beliefs strongly, but that doesn't mean i can't be convinced, nor does that mean i can't support conservative causes.   we have to find ourselves in a higher place than petty bickering and lies. we have to come together as a nation to make amends. to our children, and to our children's children, it will be a great deal to help create a fair democracy that favors no sides, but considers them as equals and  treats them as such. [end]
[start] Thanks so much for thinking this hard about it. most don't. most stick with whichever party their friends/family are a part of and then defend it to the end of time like a baseball team. Politics isn't a sport, there are no sides, it's just about who is serving the people better. You're honestly really brave and I commend you. [end]
[start] You should consider registering as a Democrat, especially if you live in a closed-primary state, so your voice gets heard.    I am a pro-life Democrat.  Despite what the propaganda coming from evangelical circles of the religious right says, Democrats do *not* advocate the use of abortion as birth control.  I have serious moral and ethical issues with abortion, but I recognize that it is sometimes the only available option in emergencies.  I think comprehensive sex ed will reduce the demand for abortion, because if you know how to avoid accidental pregnancies, they’ll happen a lot less often.  Making abortion illegal just drives it underground and creates terrible outcomes for the mother and their unwanted children.  I am hostile to religion for reasons that we need not explore in this thread, but the Democratic Party as a whole is not.  Keeping religion out of government is critical to protecting religion from government.  Your faith is perfectly compatible with the values of the Democratic Party.  We are not anti-theist, nor do we have purity tests.  We welcome diversity of thought and opinion. [end]
[start] Well done. It's difficult reassessing strongly held beliefs. I have to say though that I'm not a fan of describing ones self or registering as a member of any political party. It can blind you to what that party is doing or what it's current policies are. I'm in the UK and I try to look at what each party is stating as their plans are and choose from that. It very good of you to start thinking about what you're supporting. Keep trying understand why people believe things that are contrary to what you believe, even if you don't change your beliefs it will help you understand why others hold their beliefs rather than just putting it down to them being idiots. [end]
[start] Presidents should only be figure heads, cheerleaders if you will. Congress makes law. We are in bad times when a sitting president makes policy. Congress needs to get back to doing the will of the people and stop playing politics. [end]
[start] This is also my first year changing my voter registration from republican to democrat. Andrew Yang is the first Democrat I actually want to vote for. [end]
[start] Since you are so staunchly "pro-life" I have to ask, are you also in favor of free healthcare (including birth control and contraceptives) for all, comprehensive sex-ed in public schools, an increase in funds to social welfare programs for poor women and children like food stamps or WIC and more aggressive penalties for men who abandon their children?   I'd also like to know where you stand on the death penalty.. [end]
[start] Congrats on having the ability to acknowledge what was wrong with your decision and trying to make it right. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 [end]
[start] I mean, here's the secret, the Republicans are the same people they were 8-12 years ago.  It's just that the figurehead better reflects their members. [end]
[start] Bravo. [end]
[start] I don't even consider myself as a liberal. Some of my beliefs lean towards a moderate. But as a black man, I find it real hard to align myself with a party that disenfranchise minorities like the Republicans. [end]
[start] It takes a lot to look past what's most important to you and look at the bigger picture. We're proud of you. [end]
[start] There are a lot of christian democrats out there (I have literally been harassed for my agnosticism by them 🙃).   My fam also used to be republican and now they are split due to Trump. Half of my fam loves him and half of my fam HATES him. [end]
[start] Stay registered as a republican and show up to vote in primaries. Write in no confidence a lot. [end]
[start] Just a heads up, depending on your state, if you want to have any say in who the candidate going up against the incumbent will be, you may have to register as a democrat in order to vote in the primary, and also depending on your state "independent" may actually be the name a of a party that you do not wish to be affiliated with. The good news is, you can switch party affiliation every election cycle if you have to in order to vote for who you want. It's dumb that you have to do such a thing in some places, but if they are going to make convoluted rules, it doesn't hurt to know them. [end]
[start] cool now vote for bernie [end]
[start] I wish more people were able to let go of political tribalism, and see that the team they staunchly support can sometimes get it horribly wrong. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Welcome to the side of reason, friend. Don't feel bad, a lot of good people were fooled by him in the beginning. [end]
[start] There are republican for Obama buttons.   Would you like one? [end]
[start] I'm always amazed that pro-life conservatives actually vote Republican anymore.  The biggest war mongers are always Republicans (talk about serious outlay of our tax money!), and half of them have daughters/mistresses who had abortions. Even if they were all the wonderful religious people they claimed to be, isn't invasion of your personal life just more big government encroachment?  I know I am exaggerating (a bit) but that shit is funny. [end]
[start] Wish this happened more often. Thank you for this post, and I genuinely appreciate your realization and transition. It's very mature of you.  Nobody is trying to convert Republicans either. Well, maybe some people are, but that isn't the proper way to handle the situation. I'm pleased to see you think for yourself and turn away from your party which no longer represents you and your beliefs. However, I do want it to be clear that regardless of your political standpoint, there is no wrong answer. We simply wish that those who blindly follow this idiotic lunatic and farce and his administration would come to realize just how terrible they truly are, or at the very least begin to question them.  Regardless, I am an Independent myself, and I firmly believe both ends of the political spectrum to be a joke. Unfortunately I don't believe there will be any reparations in the foreseeable future, but I can hold onto hold. I just won't bother holding my breath. [end]
[start] \>because I am pro-life and I believe in God. It is no longer acceptable to disregard all the problems with my party simply because they claim to hold to two beliefs I have. Likewise, it is no longer acceptable to dismiss so much of the Democratic party simply because they do not agree with two ideals that are very important to me  You're pro-life and that's important to you, you say.  How about the lives of people outside of a uterus? How about people killed by insurance companies, people killed by refusing to expand Medicaid? How about people killed by pollution? How about the lives of people killed by all the Republican policies?  The Democrats are far more pro-life than the Republicans. If you were really pro-life, you'd support Democratic policies since they support the lives of people from birth to old age. They even support the lives of the pre-born as far as getting those pre-born medical care and nutrition.  Let me remind you that when Alabama passed their recent abortion law   \>ALABAMA LEGISLATORS REFUSE TO FUND MOTHER AND CHILD HEALTH CARE AS THEY BAN NEARLY ALL ABORTIONS  \>Alabama's Senate approved legislation on Tuesday that would ban nearly all abortions in the state at every stage of pregancy, but refused to consider amendments that would take provide health care for the mothers who were denied abortions.  \>State Senator Linda Coleman-Madison proposed an amendment to the bill that would require the state to provide free prenatal and medical care for mothers who had been denied an abortion by the new law. Her amendment was struck down by a vote of 23-6.  \> [https://www.newsweek.com/alabama-abortion-ban-mother-child-health-care-1426643](https://www.newsweek.com/alabama-abortion-ban-mother-child-health-care-1426643)   \*\*\*That's not a pro-life position. That's just an anti-abortion position.\*\*\*  As for believing in God...Lot of Democrats believe in God. They support the right to believe in God. They just don't support the right of you forcing other people to believe in your god and following your religion's rules.  And yet the Democrat's policies are far more in line with the Christian God than the Republican's policies.   [https://i.redd.it/rmpi802qz6331.png](https://i.redd.it/rmpi802qz6331.png)   Someone who really wants to be pro-life and follow the Christian God should be voting Democratic. Not Republican. [end]
[start] To be honest though --- many many democrats have a strong faith. The pro-life part may not be common on the left, but religion isn't as uncommon as conservatives might have you believe. There is certainly a community there! [end]
[start] we need more open minded people like you in this country! [end]
[start] Now if only you could somehow share your same awareness to the rest of your republican registered constituents. [end]
[start] r/UnsentLetters [end]
[start] Exactly why im Independent i vote for policies not the party anymore. (and POC are mostly conservative than liberal so that myth about them being Democrats, its fake most of my friends who are Latinx and African American are Republicans but now Independent since Trump showed that the party is a bunch of crooks). [end]
[start] Wasn’t until around roe v wade that republicans flip flopped on abortion, changing from advocating for privacy of the woman and government deregulation to where they are now, totally fucking inconsistent and hypocritical.. Really fucking wild. [end]
[start] We need to get away from a two party system. Everything about it is wrong. Everyone thinks that you have to be on one side or the other. It splits everything and make everyone bicker back and forth even the government which does no good. [end]
[start] Vote whoever you want idc. But I have a right to say vote for Yang. If you don’t like it, then you don’t like America. [end]
[start] Why do you think Republicans believe in god and Democrats don't? Or perhaps a better question is why a belief (or lack thereof) in a diety is am important characteristic of a politician? [end]
[start] This is good, this is very very good, things are very very good, you’re a very very good person.  My own personal political beliefs aside (strongly on the  side of the fence of the I (do not give a fuck) party) that’s pretty damn cool to hear someone say such things in today’s world. Gives me a small amount of hope back for my country. Maybe I won’t have to dig a hole and hide from it all after all.  It’s a small gesture but here’s my upvote for having your own self worth and dignity in the face of mistakes such as these. [end]
[start] You can still be pro life, believe in God, and not be a Republican. I'm pretty pro-life but I'm a raging Democrat that won't pass laws that insert the government into the patient-doctor relationship. That's just huge government and an invasion of bodily autonomy, which I'm all for. I also want a good, solid safety net for our soldiers our children and our poor.   I think what keeps me from being a Republican anymore (I was one from 1988 to 2007) is their weird stance of: no big government in the boardroom but all kinds of big government in the bedroom. I had to ask myself, which is more in line with individualistic autonomy, regulating the behavior of every man and woman's, consenting, naughty bits or a corporation that has the potential to effect the health and prosperity of millions? The choice was clear to me. [end]
[start] Let the healing begin [end]
[start] You are right we should not vote because of party, but because we want the best people to lead our country. Your are going in the right direction I don't mean because of party but because of you taking the time to really think things through. [end]
[start] we need people like you. Everyone’s upbringing plays a part in what they believe in but it takes character to admit when you’re wrong willing to change for the better. I salute you man [end]
[start] Just a suggestion....  Before you change your registration, consider whether you want to vote in the primaries.   I am also a Republican, and I will probably be changing my registration.   However, I live in a state that does not have open primaries.    This means that anyone registered as an independent doesn’t get to vote in the primaries.  It’s important to me that I be able to vote in the republican primary, so that I can vote for someone who opposes Trump in the election.   This way I can do what I can to get someone else on the ticket next year.  My opinion is that doing it this way allows me to do the most to oppose him.  If your state has open primaries, not an issue, just make sure you understand the ramifications of changing from Republican to Independent.  Regardless, I will not vote to re-elect Trump, and will actively work against his re-election. [end]
[start] FUCK YEAH! [end]
[start] So... what is it Trump did that you don’t like? Defund Planned Parenthood? I can understand supporting individual pro-life Democrats, but on a whole that party touts abortion as some kind of womanly virtue.  Just a Canadian’s 2 cents ✌🏼 [end]
[start] Yea say good bye to your elephant friends. They aren't going to talk to you (they'll talk about to behind your back), invite you to party, cook outs, etc. anymore. I'm only saying this because I know how politics affects peoples relationships and I could be wrong and hope I am. Maybe they are good and real friends that don't push people away because of what party they belong to. I'm kinda in the same boat , I started full blown Democrat , but as I got older started leaning more to the right on things such as guns , healthcare, and a few other things but I'm in the middle because I disagree with both party  views and positions on a few things, but most of all it's how bad it's how each party trash talk the other instead of compromising to find solutions that can help the people instead of just bring right all the time and winning . The current state of politics is just sad and cruel. There is corruption on both sides and niether party seems to act or rule like our founding fathers would have wanted  They must be turning in third graves. [end]
[start] This is the entire reason why I despise political parties so much. It encourages people to root for a "team" rather than just pick the candidate that most closely represents their views. I'm glad you've been able to break away from that partisan mentality, even if I don't agree with you. More people need to start adopting this line of thought. [end]
[start] Hi sir,  I respect that you believe in God and have some ideals but what I can't understand is why do you think everyone else should follow those ideals too? For example I believe in God too but that doesn't mean I or the government should have the right to decide if women can have abortions or not. I wouldn't have one because I feel it's wrong. Always vote based on who will be good for your future, that is invest in your development as an individual through education, health and law and order reforms.  I am from pakistan and it scares me to think a country that can spend almost 3 times our GDP on defense alone cant provide health care to it's citizens and a third world country like pakistan has government subsidised healthcare for the poor. Needless to say overall we have issues too (actually far greater than most countries on the planet) but atleast as far as health care is concerned we are better than the richest and most powerful country in the world.  Also our government initiated a 10 billion tree planting program I know it's way too ambitious and is bound to fail but hey even if we hit like 5% of the target it's still playing our part in trying to solve the global warming crises unlike the Republican party who will just literally let our future generations pay for an election victory tomorrow. (On mobile so sorry for spelling errors) [end]
[start] Both parties are dissolving in their own poison. I can’t believe in either. [end]
[start] Just a question, do you think Hillary would have been a better option than Trump? [end]
[start] I think most people aren’t single issue voters. You just have to parse out which candidates you want in each cycle.   I agree with you though. President Trump cares not for due process or the constitution or his party. The party currently cares not for its constituents.   Good luck. I wish you the best.   Also, health care is great. We’re getting hosed by not having a better federal system with fixed pricing. [end]
[start] Honestly I'm a life long democratic voter. Atheist, scientifically minded. However the democrats have really pissed me off since Obama. The PC culture "reparations for slavery", the general pandering to minority voters, trying to legislate diversity, etc. All that shit drives.me.nuts. Democrats fucking suck too and I am losing my patience with them. You won't ever catch me voting red, I think Donald Trump is an absolute disgrace to this country and does not represent me, my views, beliefs, or ideals. However, more and more, I am seeing both sides converging on being equally insane and unrepresentative of the majority of Americans but rather just reflections of their extremist bases. [end]
[start] r/Trumpgret [end]
[start] Wow! I can’t believe people are giving you kudos. I’m not generally a negative person but here goes...  As a believer in god you voted for a known lying, cheating, serial adulterer, racist who legitimately hints at wanting to violate his daughter; because you don’t want women to have abortions. [end]
[start] Easy karma [end]
[start] To be fair, both parties are hugely corrupt. One just happens to be a little more blatant about it. Good on you for maintaining critical thinking and the ability to change your mind on subjects most people don’t dare budge. I pray for a day that moderates or middle line people can make a stand in politics [end]
[start] Js pro-life policies tend to actually increase the number of unwanted pregnancies and possible abortions, and I'd say the democratic party is far from being officially atheist. Sounds like you might support them more than you think [end]
[start] Remember, Trump is not really the issue. All other republicans in senate/congress support him and what they are doing as a government.  Trump is just a face for the rest. [end]

[start] Registering as Independent takes you out of the political process. You’d be better off staying republican and voting for candidates you support in primaries. You can vote for whoever you want in the general, it doesn’t matter how you’re registered, but regestering “I” will stop you from having any say in any party with even a remote chance of victory.  Also be careful, the nazi party is the “independence” party on registrations, you have to make sure you’re actually registering  independent and not “independence” [end]

[start] I have a question as a non American.  What is "registering"? How does it affect politics? If you are "registered" as a republican, you can't legally vote for democrats? [end]
[start] Thanks for your thoughtful post. There are many things that need to be considered when choosing who to vote for. Some people and parties will agree with some of the things you do and will disagree with some. Your title is an apology to President Obama. Looking back on his presidency, are there any things that you, OP, can point out that you now retrospectively admire / agree with him on? [end]
[start] welcome to the light. thought for a moment you were going over to the other dark side. been an independent always. voted republican once (sorry jimmy), 3rd party perot, paul, stein...joyfully voted for obama in 08. with anger in 12. forgive the banks? wut?! [end]
[start] As an independent myself, I can't find myself agreeing with either side. However, I can pick-and-choose the things I agree to an *extent* on. Sometimes I'll agree with a majority of an agreement set down by a Democrat, sometimes it's by a Republican.    You have a great groundwork and perception for understanding both sides of a debate now, and I encourage you to keep listening to how to you're thinking and perceiving things like you already are and make choices accordingly.  Thank you for going public and sharing your thoughts. It's very bold of you! [end]
[start] Lol [end]
[start] That’s a very mature decision to make. I support! [end]
[start] Remember you can not vote in primary elections if you are registered as an independent. [end]
[start] I didnt vote because i dont like Trump or Hillary, but Trump has proven better then Obama tho, honestly. [end]
[start] Obama was a terrible president though. [end]
[start] Cheers, bro!  I was republican once...even Young Republican in university. Voted for Reagan x 2, bush the father and 1st term of Bush the son.  By 2003 it was very clear Bush had lied to to us all about iraqs wmds.    I've been an independent ever since, but mostly vote democratic as they are closer to the ideals I have  Republicans were different back then... They weren't infested with evangelicals trying to make America a Christian nation [end]
[start] If you are pro life, funding planned Parenthood and giving women safe access to birth control has reduced the numbers of abortions in states like Colorado. So that's something to think about, if you really care about the life of unborn children, make sure they are born to women who want them. [end]
[start] I almost voted for trump. I couldn't bring myself to do it so I just went to the beach [end]
[start] Democrats aren’t against God. We’re just more about women having control over their bodies than we are against “pro-life.” [end]
[start] While Trump is clearly horrible, how exactly did Bush earn your vote twice over?  The man dragged the country into an unjustified war in Iraq, which ended up killing upwards of 600,000 civilians.  And he also promoted the use of torture and rape on detainees.  You lean heavily on Christian values but I really have to wonder where your conscience was back then? [end]
[start] Fuck yes dude. I am a liberal, leaning towards socialist with much of the things that come along with that typically.  I want you to know if you read this I appreciate you and I don't want or need you to turn on your principles and agree with me/us in everything , but I do expect at this point any decent conservative to distance themselves from Trump.  Thank you for evolving basically. [end]
[start] What exactly are you giving Obama credit for?  He did *literally nothing* in 8 years.   Hate Trump all you want, but to say you didn’t give Obama enough credit demonstrates that you do not know very much about this, or were never actually a registered republican. [end]
[start] Not to harp on you, but it is really confusing to me when so many people seem to mix religion with their politics.  Can you give an honest answer as to why those subjects shouldn't be completely separate, and both Republican and Democrat policy shouldn't be completely agnostic to religion?  I would be so much more likely to vote Republican if there wasn't so much religion in the base, wanting to mix religion and politics.  I don't mind a lot of the Republicans stances on things, I just don't think it should give special standing to one religion over others.  I don't want my vote to end up automatically being pro or against a certain religion by association with the political party, I'd rather all political parties had nothing to do with religion...  What about the fact that this country, like many others, should be accepting of all religions? [end]
[start] President Obama is the typical address. It’s like how we still say President Bush, or President Kennedy, in case you didn’t know (and happen to care). [end]
[start] Why do pro lifers who believe in god vote for republicans who clearly don’t care about either?  Fox News and Talk radio. [end]
[start] More of those pro-life Republican policies that got people killed...  >Lovequawn Scott was turned away from a mental health facility the day before he killed four of his family members in Mount Pleasant in 2018, said Jennifer Kneece Shealy with the Ninth Circuit’s Solicitor’s Office in court Friday.  >“He was denied treatment because he did not have the requisite funds and no insurance,” she added.  https://www.live5news.com/2019/10/25/man-who-killed-family-members-mt-pleasant-found-not-guilty-by-reason-mental-insanity/  I'd ask you how pro-life you're feeling your former party's positions really are, but so far you haven't had the courtesy or the guts to reply to me even one time. [end]
[start] I used to be a staunch Trump supporting Republican. But over the last year or so I’ve left that mindset almost completely behind as well.  Good on you my friend, party loyalty is never a good idea. And in all reality, neither are parties in general. [end]
[start] Im swowwy mr owama [end]
[start] edit: independents can't vote in the primary...if you truly want to help get this man out, register as a Democrat until after the primary so you can be sure your vote goes towards the BEST POSSIBLE PERSON to beat the D. [end]
[start] The biggest congrats to you is for shaking off the “one issue voter” mantle. I see it to often that the Democratic Party upholds 90% of someone’s values, but they vote Republican because they are “pro gun” or “pro choice”. It’s sickening, and they wonder why they were about to lose their healthcare or why they didn’t get a tax return this year...Also, there’s plenty of religious Democrats, Republicans are more the...Crazed White Evangelist end, you want to be far away from that, it’s the US’s version of radicalized religion.  Seriously though, good job on that. Another important distinction is that you can be pro-life and pro-choice at the same time. The fact is, Republicans are pro-birth, not pro-life. They could give two shits about the mom or the baby once it’s born, especially if they are minorities. You’re against abortion, but are you against the mother having a choice to abort? For health reasons, for safety reasons, rape, or incest? If you can make that distinction, then you’ve always been in the wrong party until now. Pro-choice isn’t pro-Abortion, it’s...just pro choice, haha! [end]
[start] It's good you learned but I hope you know you aren't off the hook.     The sheer *damage* that this administration has done to this country is horrifying. It would take me hours to list out all of it. Suffice it to say that because of Trump's actions, I really think it is possible that we will lose our status as the world's #1 superpower within the next few decades. That is seriously how bad this is.     You guys voted him in, when it was **SO. FUCKING. OBVIOUS.** that Trump is the living embodiment of EVERYTHING you guys apparently hated (coastal elitism, infidelity, disrespect for our troops, etc. etc. etc.). Why? I will never truly be able to understand what the FUCK was going through your heads.      But you betrayed this country. You really, really did. You're actions DIRECTLY impacted our economy, our allies' trust, our respectability on the world stage.     I will never \*truly\* be able to forgive you. [end]
[start] I am the opposite of you. Lifetime democrat here, I voted Obama both times. Then i realized how bad of a job he was doing and how divided things became when he turned people against the police, and cut the balls off of the military.  I'm both an Army veteran and in law enforcement.   I voted for Trump this time around, and am glad I did because our country is doing great! I get more money, the minority groups are better represented, and the military is stronger than ever.  Also, we have record low unemployment!  Sure Trump says stupid things, but he gets the job done. He didn't just happen to get elected, he is a direct symptom of how bad our government had gotten, and he is setting things right. Before he was president, rappers sang about being like him, the Clintons loved him, and nobody called him racist, bigot, or homophobic.  Once he became president people called him all those things, and immediately talked about impeachment on the news. That's when i knew that changing my vote was a great idea. I will be voting for Trump again in 2020. [end]
[start] What is Obama’s last name? [end]
[start] Congrats! [end]
[start] Lol you need to get that TDS treated. [end]
[start] oragn man bad   edit: thakn gold strangr!!! [end]
[start] I'd definitely start going independent and start listening to and researching candidates [end]
[start] Hi!! [end]
[start] FYI: if you wouldn't have an abortion yourself but don't care what others do; you're pro-choice, just not for yourself. [end]
[start] Good for you. Keep this attitude and share it with your peers. Obama was the man.   Granted, in your defense, the Republican Party was very different years ago. It makes sense that this is happening now. [end]
[start] Kudos to you as others have said. I do want to say, the Democratic party is not against God or believing in God - no matter what God or god or no god at all. I think you'll find there are plenty of people of faith in the Democratic party. Cheers bud. [end]
[start] I...don't know what to call myself anymore.  I'm pro guns.  I'm pro abortion.  I'm pro stopping illegal immigration.  I think Obama made a lot of mistakes, but at least he didn't sounds like a high school drop out bully.  Trump's "common speak" is an insult to our country.  However you have AOC and her fantasyland list of "good" ideas that are 100% not possible.   You have Chicago, Baltimore, LA and SF, all ran fucking horribly by...democrats.  Republicans..oh you mean like Alabama, and Mississippi, two of the worst fucking states based on almost any factor like education, income, etc?  Those non vaccinating, bible thumping idiots are the real idiots who need abortions.   Here's my take...99% of people running for election don't give a shit about you.  They care more about their rich friends.  Yes, BOTH sides.   The one thing that someone could maybe possibly slightly fix, would be heathcare, and the only ones "claiming" to want to do that are Democrats....so fuck it, I'll give my nod to Bernie Sanders.  I disagree with him on plenty, but we need to stop getting fucked over by insurance companies.   Universal heathcare can't come quick enough.  Yes, I DO know multiple people in Canada, UK, Germany, Spain, etc and while it's not perfect, maybe even not great, they at least don't go broke over heath issues. [end]

[start] It’s really hard to step back and take stock of our beliefs and stances. So good job doing so.   If it makes you feel any better, science-based, sex-ed (not abstinence only), access to birth control, and access to safe, legal abortion is actually more “pro-life” in that it prevents more “deaths”, if you want to count abortions as deaths. This is the only proven way to lower abortions while also helping lower deaths from unsafe abortions. It also cuts down on STIs and teen pregnancy.   By the way, if you’re looking for more straight-forward news sources, I’d recommend NPR or BBC.   I’d urge you (and others) to remember though, that Trump is unlike any other candidate we’ve ever had. Sure I’ve disagreed with every other Republican candidate we’ve had. But this is different. This is dangerous. We don’t really have the luxury of voting for the perfect candidate this time. We didn’t have that luxury three years ago. So while the Democratic candidate, whoever that is, might not be your top choice, I urge you to still vote for that person in an effort to get Trump out of office. He is truly a danger to this country. [end]
[start] We would not be friends. You screwed over my grandkids air and water quality not to mention quality of life as the man you voted for has plundered our treasury and is driving our national debt beyond the stars. Do better. Much better. Everyone who voted for this clown should be storming the immigration centers and protesting. That still doesn’t make up for having this criminal in office. [end]
[start] Interesting.. I truly am an indecent.. voted for Clinton.. then bush twice then Obama twice and now Trump.. I actually feel the exact opposite way. Democrats to me seem to have gotten away from the norm and just want to do everything for people that do not do their part..Seems to me that the government only works for “the rich” or on the other hand for people who do not work.. while very capable.. The news media is horrendous to the point where I can no longer watch cable news it’s pathetic.. neither side will work with the other the Trump hatred is unreal..Now will I vote for him again? Not sure but right now the options aren’t looking good for the dems.. All I know is none of this shit is working right now and the answers are not there on the dem side for me.. [end]
[start] If i were president i would make sure all those babies were born and grew up in grade A+ orphanages [end]
[start] So I'm not american but I wanna know why people don't like Bernie sanders. I mean doesn't he make sense [end]
[start] Literally what? [end]
[start] You should have felt ashamed to be a republican long before Trump. Both parties are corrupt, disingenuous, self serving scumbags with stupid sheep that follow them thinking they have their best interest in mind. It's sad that it took an egomaniac and unprecedented media bias to wake you up a little bit, and equally sad that you hated on Obama just for being on the "wrong side". Even now you seem confused, praising Obama as if he did anything good. You're desperately clinging to a sense of belonging, of needing to play for a team. Join team America, stop wasting time chasing bias... [end]
[start] Don't be dude. It's completely ok to stand up for what you believe in but don't let other's change YOUR mind cause Trump did something people didn't like. I'm not going to say trump is the BEST president but I'm not going to say he's the worst. The issue is that my generation and the next has no idea what politics and vote blindly based on simple notions of what politics are. Sure, I grew up in a lose republican house, but that's not why I vote republican. I vote for the republican party BECAUSE I don't want a socialistic society where it doesn't matter what I do, I'll get paid the same as a janitor.   &#x200B;  A lot of millennials think that they should be handed a job and money and a home. If that's what you want, go move to china, russia, find a country where everyone is "equal." It's not that simple. Granted, in America, you can be homeless and still get treated nicely. But that's not the case here. I vote republican because democrats only make things worse. Remember when Obama tried to make the country pay for health insurance EVEN if couldn't pay for it and you'd be fined if you didn't? Yeah, you know how many people would be in DEBT right now if that actually worked? OK then.   &#x200B;  Don't sit there and be sorry, look for what you want in America and find ways to change that. [end]
[start] Wow. Thank you for sharing this. Thank you for being open minded and giving me hope!! [end]
[start] I'm with you on most of this however Bernie kind of bailed for what reason we really don't know. They gave us the ol' he didn't have the delegates spiel but the only reason the vote was as close as it was is because Bernie rallied the liberals who in turn voted mostly for Hillary mistakenly believing she was the liberal candidate because Bernie ended up endorsing her.    I don't know what we should have done. The media with the DNCs help eliminated every other GOP candidate then eliminated Bernie leaving us with the goatf*ck of a choice we had. It was and continues to be great for ratings. Even Jeb bowed out because it was "a clownshow" or something like that.     Seriously,  had you polled Americans for the least liked public figures a year or two before the election Trump and Hillary would have been up there with Kanye and the Kardashians for most hated.   My gut tells me the media is gonna get Trump reelected because ratings.     Not a single democratic candidate has a chance with the exception of maybe Warren or Buttigieg but only if they agree to tow the party line which is to sell out.    Biden will probably still end up being the nominee because they know he plays ball but he's boring and can't really win. [end]
[start] It’s not everyday that you see someone apologize for their political beliefs and accept their faults. Although I do lean left I am completely ok with the people on the right but I think it’s imperative that people look at the platforms not just peoples beliefs because at the end of the day it’s the platform that decides the policies more than the beliefs do. [end]
[start] You sound like a good dude, and I really commend you on making this post. That being said, I just wanted to let you know that the hardliners on the conservative side make the same type of posts online, and even Fox News has done schpeals about "converted people".   &nbsp;  I hope you tell the people around you about your revelation, so that *they* know it's real. That way your thoughts actually spread at ground level, instead of being another untrustworthy internet thing. [end]
[start] Fellow (?) Republican here.  I voted Libertarian last election as I couldn't stand Trump or Hillary.  I'm surprised you couldnt see Trump's buffoonery before you pulled for him.    As to his administration proper, there have been things I liked, and things I dont.  More than anything, I despise his behavior generally, his unpresidential manner.  It's an embarrassment.    I'm not sure what I'll do in 2020. [end]
[start] Michelle is proud of you. [end]
[start] Please consider checking out Andrew Yang. I’m a born and raised and registered republican and Yang makes more sense to me than any republican candidate ever has.   His motto is, “Not Left, Not Right, Forward.” And, even if just for this election, I will be re-registering as a democrat to vote for this man. [end]
[start] One thing I will warn you about is that in some states, you can only vote dem if you're a registered dem and can only vote republican if a registered republican.  If you're a registered independent this can basically throw a wrench into your plans, if you plan to vote that is.  I would look up the laws in your state. [end]
[start] Lol wtf concern troll [end]
[start] Hey now that you've opened your mind up just a little bit, only took two decades, you can spend your next 20 years questioning why you believe in bronze age mythology and forcing women to have babies they'll hate because "fuck you woman and fuck you child! Go have a shit life together!" Meanwhile not supporting things that may at least help *prevent* unwanted pregnancy (thus abortions too) and also probably not really giving a shit this entire time about whether or not the man paid child support or is present at all, what amount of money that should be, or maybe government funding further healthcare and education so these children you supposedly cared so much about when they were in the womb could have a half assed chance at a decent childhood.  Yeah, lots more to life than God and forcing women to have children. [end]
[start] At first I thought this was a r/copypasta [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Talk about narcissists... Do you think anyone cares about you or your apology? Especially a man who was the fucking president of the United States? This is the most pathetic circlejerky karma grab I've ever seen in my life. If I were a Reddit admin I'd perma ban you from the site on principle. Like anyone gives a fuck about you. [end]
[start] I still can’t believe there are “Christians” who are Republicans. Brings shame to what god-loving people are supposed to be. [end]
[start] Honestly the Clintons seem dodgy as hell regarding emails, your country had to choose between two unsuitable candidates for president. Obama was such a nice guy.  Unfortunately my country is run by a bunch of idiotic people. One was a pig fucker, one was a muppet who didn’t know what she was doing. And the clown we have at the minute is a serial womaniser and wife beater who think he’s can just make up rules and suspend all politicians doing their job until his idea goes into action. And that’s just the last three. Another got us into a recession. [end]
[start] This seems ridiculous at best. Your lack of reasoning is why I think this is fake.  What Trump as done is made me research on the large amount of scandals that Obama as gone through in his presidency. I feel bad that I supported someone like Obama because he is a scumbag. There isn't anything good about him and the people that voted for him are scum, plain and simple.  Good on you for being an independent though. [end]
[start] inb4 'this was their plan to discredit the repubs so much people will stop voting for them as default and will start listening to the news and vote whatever we want them to vote instead ps forgot to take my antipsychotics' [end]
[start] I'm the opposite. I used to be a Democrat since 18, after all everyone in my family is, and 99 percent of my friends are as well. But that's pretty typical within Jewish communities. After eight years of Obama, and Hillary Clinton being the DNC favorite, even going so far as to snuff out Bernie. I knew we needed real change. So I voted for Trump instead of the establishment. Someone I felt would make some real change to better America, and I will vote Trump again in 2020 because he's making a positive impact where it counts. I used to believe that most Democrats weren't gun-grabbers, but looking at the candidates now, they are that and so much more that this country does not ever need, which is socialism. We don't need wide open borders, universal healthcare, even for illegals, of which they won't have to pay for.   I'm Libartarian who leans towards conservative values. So, I think that the government has no right to any of the money that I make. Income tax is theft, property taxes paid to a governing body is theft, and so will universal healthcare be. Democratic candidates all seem to be in favor of "mandatory buybacks" of certain firearms that they never bought, nor owned to begin with. The Democratic party is the enemy of freedom.    Even though you and I may now be on different sides, it is always important to stand up for what you believe in, and let it be known. I can respect that. I lost all of my friends, with the exception of just a few, and had family members make up tall tales of threats that got me arrested, and now they are being sued by me, because I proved my innocence. All of this because I chose to vote differently and I didn't hide it. I know you won't go through such an extreme change, but I do imagine you will probably lose a few friends. It's silly, because at the end of the day, politics isn't what made a friendship.   Reddit loves to hate Trump, so I am sure my comment will be downvoted to hell, and that's fine.   Good luck on your new path! [end]
[start] This owns. I'm really glad you're open to critical thinking. It's OK to be critical of our leaders, we should be. It's even OK if you voted for Trump. I'm a life long liberal and I don't, won't, and shouldn't hold it against you. You realize that it was a mistake.      Interesting about pro life and wanting to believe in god. [Watch this clip, but not to get you on board with a democrat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naA8OlSQ1mU), but more to show you you're right in the way you're thinking. [end]
[start] I'm pro choice and not a Christian (I don't believe in "god" in any form). But I still believe the republicans are the better of the two parties to run the country.   I mean, does how you register really matter? You can vote for either party in the general election, can't you? [end]
[start] xD fuck outta here. #TRUMP2020 [end]
[start] Your weedy self-flagellation on a public board populated almost exclusively by ill-informed and virtue signalling low performers has renewed my own faith in the precept: "TRUMP NOW. MORE THAN EVER!"  Let the down votes begin. Your approval would sicken me. [end]
[start] Make America Great Again [end]
[start] I score very high in humility testing. It just means I’m willing to listen and not insist I’m right, ever. It also means it will be hard for everyone to convince me they are right. If you are humble enough to see a whole lot of shades of grey a two party system will never be enough. Issues like god and abortion, are made up conventions. As are many, many others.   Dividing the pie of resources will always be best done with all the ruckus and imperfections that comes from everyone chiming in.   That’s politics in a nutshell. [end]
[start] i’ll stop hating obama when he apologizes for the hospital bombing [end]
[start] I also register as an independent to avoid being tied to the Republican Party. However I rather like Donald Trump as president. What specifically has turned you away from him? [end]
[start] Don't stress it too much, Obama had many terrible issues with his presidency. [end]
[start] Abandoning PYD and withdrawing the troops was the only thing Trump did correctly. It’s not your fight so fuck outta there and leave it to Turkey to kill the terrorists who aim to take her land. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] > I often cried 'oh what a narcissist!' Obama was, "He's acting like a spoiled child!"...  I'd love to know what Obama did that makes anyone say he's a narcissist or spoiled.  I spent years listening to people I know claim how he's some closet terrorist going to destroy America from the inside and never give up his power. All I'm thinking is "wow he was the worst terrorist ever then."  ___________  I always want to remind people, you have the right to not vote. You don't HAVE to vote. Far too many people vote on issues even though they're dissatisfied. For example the conservative who doesn't like their candidate but they vote for them anyways because of abortion or something.  Well don't! This is why. You don't have to choose one or the other. You can choose neither by not participating. The "pick a side" part of this is trash. I'm not obligated to decide between two piles of trash, and I'm also still allowed an opinion that it's all trash. [end]

[start] I am sorry you were put through all that. I am sorry you were raised in an environment, where you were oppressed, and not loved the way you should be.   You are an inspiration, and an aspiration. You are a living example of what love, can do. Thank you for sharing, thank you for lifting my soul, thank you for helping me see gratitude, and it’s profound importance.   I love you. You are loved. Don’t ever forget that. Be well friend. [end]

[start] What a great story..  Must drive your family crazy..  Please update us when thwy come crawling back..  And they will..  Especially if they need money. [end]
[start] This is very nice. Good thing you’re doing well. :) [end]
[start] so your parents disowned you for going to college? Are they completely out of your life? [end]
[start] A very Happy Birthday to you! Love and light to you 💛 [end]
[start] Wow, you're amazing. I'll think of you from now on whenever I struggle with the downs in life. <3 [end]
[start] Saving this post because it’s so dam heartwarming. I’m so proud of you for coming this far in life. You never let the struggle stop you and now you’ve reached happiness.   I wish you good luck and mental peace for the rest of your life!  EDIT: please write a book about all your struggles and feelings throughout all of this! :) [end]
[start] 🏆😎 [end]
[start] I'm happy for you. Thank you for sharing what you endured and how you've succeeded. [end]
[start] Happy birthday to us!!! As a complete stranger on the internet, I am as proud of you as I can be. Stay strong and keep  going! [end]
[start] You’re so strong!! Happy birthday beautiful! [end]
[start] I had a perfect life compared to you: good parents, money, good school, safety... Yet I want to kill myself since 7 years ago. It's clearly genetics. [end]
[start] Sometimes I think I have it bad. But then I read people's stories like yours and I feel so grateful for what I do have, and so sad for the people who are living in worse situations every day. Congratulations on getting out of those situations, and I'm glad you are happy and loved now [end]
[start] You are strong and amazing [end]
[start] Glad life is so much better now. I know you really appreciate it after all that horrible crap you went through. I hope life keeps going so well. You've had enough bad for a lifetime. Everything you did and endured is pretty amazing. [end]
[start] You’re so strong! Keep at it. [end]
[start] Yea!! Hooray for you. [end]
[start] Made me cry and made me smile , hope the best for you In the future. [end]
[start] Bless you. I’m so impressed with you. Well done. [end]
[start] Eternally proud of you. [end]
[start] Love that you mentioned your dog’s love first and then your boyfriend in brackets lol. [end]
[start] It wasn't your fault man, it was your parents.  Trust me. [end]
[start] I am so sorry you were stuck with those parents but you’re one strong person. The best revenge is a life will lived, which is exactly what you’re doing. [end]
[start] I would read your life story if you ever wrote it down.   You sound like an extremely inspiring person and I'm happy to hear you've come so far and are doing so well! [end]
[start] I had a crazy family too!!! Good thing now you know the kind of parent you never will be. Sadly, parents like that will never be happy or realize their mistakes. It is great that you found your way out and met people who supported you. Applauding to your courageous journey! [end]
[start] You are a great story teller,I enjoyed it 😊 [end]
[start] I knew the happy ending was on it's way when I started reading this. :) [end]
[start] Well damn.... you fucking go! :) [end]
[start] Damn that's deep  I need to know  Where are they now? Do they try to contact you? If they were to try to contact you what would you do? [end]
[start] What job do you have? [end]
[start] They didn't deserve you. I know that everyone loves their parents, but the shit you went through, not a lot of people would be able to go that far. You are special. I hope your future will be bright. Looks like it already is [end]
[start] what a beautiful result! [end]
[start] I love you attitude!! We need more people like you in the world... I need to be more grateful like you [end]
[start] Your story is so touching and inspiring at the same time. When there is a will, there is a way!  I wish you all the freakin’ best that life has to offer, stay your awesome self. [end]
[start] That's the current state of the world we live in sad to say.  Not every place is like the USA.  It's bad enough here.  You did the right thing and came out on top.  Don't listen to you critics and don't more so respond to them. [end]
[start] Man, I have always fantasized about sending my future kid to a monetary of shaolin monks....  would that have been better for you? [end]
[start] ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ [end]

[start] I have never been more proud of anyone in my life. That is genuinely amazing [end]
[start] Call Guinness World Records rn [end]
[start] I was pooping! I also got all of it in the bowl. [end]
[start] Not to brag but I didn’t spill a drop during airplane turbulence last week [end]
[start]  great job .. try getting it all in whilst in a sneezing fit, then I’ll be truly impressed! [end]
[start] I do hope you put this on your resume as a Special Skill. [end]
[start] There is little worse that experiencing an earthquake while pissing.  The aim issue.  Twice, I have experienced an earthquake while, umm, fucking.  First time, she freaked out, and scarpered to the doorway, never having experienced one before.  (An earthquake, not an orgasm.)  Second time, it hit just on shared climax.  "Did the earth move for you too?"  We still laugh about that one.  Or we did, for years, until she divorced me. [end]

[start] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. [end]
[start] Where? [end]
[start] You are now the Michael Jordan of pissing into a toilets [end]
[start] I was on the toilet and it never came out so fast in my life (I also got it all in the bowl) [end]
[start] Plot twist: you sit to pee [end]
[start] You’re a national treasure, be careful. [end]
[start] I want to fuck California’s earthquake fault line. The dirt, the debris, the thought of the earth quivering under me as I slowly stick my dick into its gaping wide entrance. I keep looking at news stories and getting the firmest erections of my life seeing those beautiful cracks. She’s so open and so wanting. Each earthquake is like another whimper just begging for me to take her. The amount of cum I’ve lost just thinking about thrusting my rod into our beloved planet. Talk about getting my rocks off. Fuck I’m hard. [end]
[start] LA [end]
[start] I, too, felt that earthquake while I was on the pot. But since I'm a chick it's way easier to keep the stream in the bowl 😂😂 congrats on your killer aim! [end]
[start] i was sitting in a big soft chair and it gently jiggled it was kinda fun [end]
[start] Dude!!! I was on the toilet at work when it started and I opened the stall door with my dress up and my underwear showing when I decided I had enough time to flush the damn toilet and pull my dress down 😂 [end]
[start] Well done! Apparently it caught a few people in the bathroom [end]
[start] a 6.4 yesterday, and 7.1 today, is this a common occurrence? [end]
[start] Fuck yeah! The only thing that would have made it better is if you were also drinking a beer and managed not to spill a drop. [end]
[start] Holy crap you passed hard mode! :) [end]
[start] Good man. Keeping it classy [end]
[start] I'm so proud of you, OP! 🤗 [end]
[start] One small piss for you, one giant piss for mankind. [end]
[start] The 6.4 yesterday was rated by a friend as "the shakiest piss of my life" [end]
[start] Yee yee! I road that waaave! [end]
[start] Name checks the fuck out [end]

[start] Nice [end]
[start] Attaboy. [end]
[start] I was worried for a moment that there was video. [end]
[start] An earthquake? At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your toilet bowl?! [end]
[start] Respect [end]
[start] Once an earthquake happened near my city and I was sleeping. Thankfully it doesn't affect anywhere around my city but my parents didn't wake me up just left me in the house and went outside while the earthquake happening. [end]
[start] Hell yeah doggie [end]
[start] you're breathtaking! [end]
[start] You fuckin champ [end]
[start] Wow, dude. You're like a piss wizard or something. [end]
[start] You need to write a book about it, more of an accomplishment than are in most autobiographies. [end]
[start] Damn, now that's impressive! Felt it on the central Coast and posted about it on casual conversation. Now we're just holding our breath to see if a bigger one is coming. [end]
[start] I called my Grandpa and Dad and told them this.  We are all proud of you. [end]

[start] Now, are you proud because you've mastered urine marksmanship? Or because you had the calmness to no freak out and run out of the building? [end]
[start] You are a national hero [end]
[start] ayeee i felt it!!! solidarity [end]
[TITLE] I found a $20 bill... and cried for 10 minutes [TITLE]
[start] You got your white whale. Now what you gonna do?  [end]
[start] That's a great story.  I'm sitting here in my kitchen wiping away some tears because I know how you feel.  This story was very relatable.  Do you feel like you have this sense of closure now, a sense of happy relief?  Did you think of your Dad?  Did a rush of memories fill your brain?  How do you plan to keep the $20 now?  What a great story, I'm so glad you found it.  [end]
[start] Thats a really beautiful story man, thanks for sharing [end]
[start] Please tell me you're going to frame that $20 bill.  You've got a great story there! [end]
[start] Beautiful story.  Clapping for you.   Edit: I ain’t even from America. I was just touched by the story and felt like clapping for him also I clap for almost everything that’s motivational.  [end]
[start] I always think about going up to a random kid and giving them $20, knowing how meaningful it would be to them and how happy it would make them.  But you can't do that without people thinking you're a perv.  Also it would kind of condition them to trust strangers which might be bad. [end]
[start] Great story and great storytelling. This should be made into a Pixar short or something. [end]
[start] I'd give you gold had I not been so poor myself. Thanks for the motivational story bro. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] >It was one of those big desk things with huge sheets of paper. Desk blotter, we had them too.  Great story! [end]
[start] I browse reddit for these moments. Thanks for sharing OP, and RIP to your old man. [end]
[start] Such a beautiful story. Now ... go get that cap gun... [end]
[start] I came in to give you a pizza, but you gave me a reminder to hug the people around me instead. Thanks :) [end]
[start] You better go buy a cap gun and a shit ton of caps.  Something on that fantasy list 10yo you had. [end]
[start] Goddamn you! I just woke up. Now I got something in my eye...you should be a writer. [end]
[start] Frame it, op! Write a little card with this story on it, put it in a picture frame along with the bill, and pass it down to your children if you ever have them. [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing. [end]
[start] This either a bullshit sobbing story or you are just a good story writer.  [end]
[start] Great writing, made me shed a tear. Congrats on the find! [end]
[start] OP must be a best selling writer 🤔   The story is amazing, frame the bill after signing it. [end]
[start] I love this story so much!!! I want to read a whole book written by you!  [end]
[start] Suggestion: When you frame this bill: Print this story out and put it in the back of the frame.  Just so it's there. [end]
[start] Fuck you man, I just wanted to make it through one day this week without crying like a baby, but you had to go and ruin it.  As someone who lost everything from their childhood, hold on to that, get it mounted in a block of acrylic on a 200 lb steel base, that shit's going nowhere [end]
[start] This is so wholesome. I’m so glad you’re doing well <3 it’s ridiculous how things have such sentimental values. [end]
[start] Amazing story. Thanks for sharing!  [end]
[start] frame it.  [end]
[start] Lovely story, thanks for sharing [end]
[start] That's beautiful :') [end]
[start] Nice, when I found( saw someone drop) a 20$ bill, I tried to run to it to pick it up and chase after the person. Little did I know, a even faster sprinter ran for the 20$ and ran like hell the other way.  [end]
[start] Wonderful story. I've cried as an adult when I found a box of my boyhood "treasures" including yo-yo's, souvenirs from family vacations, and stuff that would be junk to anyone else.  If you haven't seen it, Amelie (French movie) plays on this theme as well, and it's pretty good. [end]
[start] Great now I cried  [end]
[start] Reading at work. Damn near sniffling. I have only cried 17 times in my life  [end]
[start] Frame that $20 and mount it above ur bed, it’s something of legend now [end]
[start] You're really great at writing, keep doing it [end]
[start] That's crazy, not 15 minutes before I read this post i found a 20usd note in a Red envelope (Chinese traditional thing) dated from 2009. It was a bit of a nice feeling. Yours has mine beat for sure! [end]
[start] Frame  it with a caption "No one or no thing is ever really gone." [end]
[start] I’m not crying, you’re crying.  [end]
[start] That story was legend.  The fact that your wife knew and appreciated it says a lot about how much it spoke to you, and even to her love of all things "you".  I imagine you have great big things in store for it, like ~~buying scratchers~~ framing it for posterity. [end]
[start] Well, thank you si much for sharing.  I can’t pass the vision of your dad laughing at you wherever he is when he saw you finding your little treasure... even guiding you to it... that’s what I thought... and yes, made me shed some happy tears.  Thank you! May God keep sending blessings your way! [end]
[start] That "desk thing with huge sheets of paper" is called a "desk blotter". So glad your mystery was finally solved!      I miss desk blotters.  [end]
[start] As it turns out, 10-year-old you was right; that *was* the greatest hiding spot of all time! [end]

[start] Damn it, who chops onions on a Wednesday morning?  😭 [end]
[start] Why are there onions in my office right now?! [end]
[start] Thanks for making me cry before going to work this morning.  [end]
[start] Now I'm crying. Fuck. [end]
[start] Yes! Caps and maybe a few “snakes” to burn off with your friends. Have at it! [end]
[start] That's awesome :) I'm glad you found it! I'm sorry for your loss though, RIP to your father  [end]
[start] This is so beautiful.. We can all relate to this, and I'm happy you found it, it feels lile a victory for us all. [end]
[start] That was an amazing story. Loved reading it!  [end]
[start] I hope you're proud of yourself, making me cry too... [end]
[start] I hope you framed it  [end]
[start] Best story EVER!    Jeez - now I feel like I was rich!   in 1962 I was five years old and got 15cents a week - when my mom could afford it.   I had three older siblings and she didn't always have enough.   (Dad wasn't in the picture.)   That would buy a Casper comic book, a nickel ice cream from Thriftys, and a bunch of penny candy from the five & dime.   Sometimes I bought two comic books or a double ice cream.    I used to hid my money in books.    Not a good idea.   Don't do it.        [end]
[start] Why am I crying?! [end]
[start] Beauty-full story. Thanks for sharing. [end]
[start] Some time in the future you're going to think of the $20 again, and you've been associating that memory with the loss of the bill for so long that you're going to forget that you actually found it, and you'll be sad about it for a second - until you re-remember finding it [end]
[start] Not even 10:30 here and I'm crying like a damn baby. Beautiful story. Thank you so much for sharing.  [end]
[start] Lovely story man! Thanks for sharing :) [end]
[start] Congrats on finding it. Nie make sure you hide it somewhere for safe keeping. [end]
[start] Such An Amazing Story! So Happy For You. Thanks For Sharing ❤️ [end]
[start] This was great! Thanks for sharing.  [end]
[start] frame it and print a copy of what you just written here at put it at the back of the frame.  a memory worth cherishing. [end]
[start] 10 Cents couldn't even buy a pack of bubble gum 40 years ago. It was 25 cents for a pack of juicy fruit.  [end]
[start] That actually had me tear up. I hope you framed it. [end]
[start] What a testament to the strength of our emotional attachments. Good for you! [end]
[start] Soooo, can I lend $20? [end]
[start] I really enjoyed your story! Definitely frame it and keep it near a photo of your father. Thanks for the uplifting story! [end]
[start] This is a beautiful story man.  [end]
[start] Now I want to hug somebody :)  [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing this wonderful story  [end]
[start] This story makes me very happy. Very glad you found it. I hope you have an amazing life. <3  [end]
[start] Love this story! So happy for you OP! [end]
[start] Idk why but this is the best thing I've read on here in a while. Rock on dude. Family is awesome. [end]
[start] such a beautiful story ;) gave some childhood vibes [end]
[start] You're gonna frame it, right?   Like, after that emotional roller-coaster if that bill is used to buy some shitty Chinese food imma be pissed.  [end]
[start] Excellent story man.  [end]
[start] /r/unexpectedcanadian [end]
[start] I think I got something in my eye. [end]
[start] Frame it. Now. [end]
[start] Stories like this do well to remind us of that which is common between us.  I chuckled after clicking on the image only to find out, lo' and behold, that the 20 in question is a ***Canadian*** $20.  Who knew?  To think that current rhetoric paints us as adversaries...crazytown.  Thanks for sharing the best story of closure I think I've ever read.  Frame that 20! [end]
[start] What a great story!  And I believe you’re describing a desk pad :) [end]
[start] Beautiful story. Since you have no shortage of money and the bill is rather symbolic, maybe put it in a glass frame? [end]
[start] This makes my heart so happy. Thank you for sharing!  [end]
[start] Man, I love that it's one of the old $20 bills, too. Which makes sense. But now I'm feeling nostalgic.  I'm sure I've got an old $5 kicking around in my collection somewhere. I'd be thrilled if I also found an old $20. [end]
[start] Fucking legit. They don't make them 20s like the use to. That $20 is no longer printed. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's about 5 versions old? [end]
[start] Wow, incredible story. It shows how memories are important to us. But finding and remembering something from 40 years back is so surreal! [end]
[start] That desk pad thing is called a blotter.  From the days of dip pens when ink would soak through. [end]
[start] Beautiful story man. [end]
[start] That's fantastic, and a great story to boot. [end]
[start] Freaking awesome. I hope you frame that sucker and keep it forever! [end]
[start] By the way, the paper thingy is a blotter. A nice one from the sound of it.  Congratulations on finding the $20! I'm still looking for my $47 I was saving to go to an amusement park. Sigh. [end]
[start] What an absolutely beautiful story. Thank you so much for sharing it.  [end]

[start] This reminds me of the time I lost my Gameboy Advanced.   I loved that thing. I was the youngest of 3 brothers so I often would not get a turn on the Gamecube while they were playing, but I always had my Gameboy Advanced. I remember I was playing with it one afternoon in the front room of my parent's house when I got called away for something.  Whatever it was took up a majority of my day so by the time I came back to the front room where I had set everything (Including my charger, Case, literally ALL of my games, etc.) it was gone! I looked everywhere for the thing. I practically interrogated my siblings, flickering light swaying gently in a dark room and everything. It's not easy to do because I was like 10, but they all insisted the hadn't seen it.  Well, I looked for days and days and never found it. Eventually I gradually lost hope but every few weeks or so I would renew my efforts as I yearned to play my games again.   Several months, and a Birthday later, my family was going on our Bi-annual road trip to visit family several states away. It was an 8 hour drive (Six if my mom was driving. She has a lead foot) and I had been dreading it for weeks. Every trip prior, I had always been able to rely on my Gameboy Advanced to keep me entertained, but now I had nothing. The morning of the trip I gathered up every last scrap of money I had from my birthdays, mowing the grass, etc, and begged my mom to stop by the local walmart. I was hoping against hope I had enough for the new [Gameboy Advance SP](https://www.amirmughal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gameboy-advance-konsole-gba-sp-rot-flame-red-netzteil.jpg).   She stopped, the whole family groaning as we were merely minutes into the long trip at that point. I rushed with her into the back of the store where the promised land was laid out before me (The electronics section). When I saw it, I stopped in my tracks. I had $80 to my name. The most money I had ever had in my life at that point. The Gameboy Advance SP Retail price was $99.99. My mother, bless her soul, saw how crushed I was and offered to pay for the remaining sum I was missing. Then, as if the heavens had opened and spilled out more generosity than I knew she was capable of, she also bought me a game to go with it. It was Metroid: Zero Mission and I will never forget playing that game.   Anyway, We went on with our merry way, me killing space pirates the whole car ride and generally content with my life.   Almost Two years passed and my SP was getting VERY well used. The L button, specifically, was starting to stick terribly. My hands were also quickly outgrowing the horribly shaped device, so it was time for an upgrade. Nintendo DS, here I come. You're the latest and Greatest portable console on the market. I got it for Christmas. It was amazing. But the games were starting to get pricy, and I couldn't afford them nearly as easily.  After wasting too many hours of my life playing NINTENDOGS I decided I wanted to play some of my old GBA games. Pokemon Ruby. Megaman Battle Network 1,2,3,etc. Golden Sun! Megaman: Zero! And many more! But lo, they were still very, very lost.   It was at that moment, I still do not know how to this day it came to me, that I realized I REALLY needed to check under the couch in the Front room. I tentatively got down on my hands and knees, pulled up the little flap of fabric that covered the bottom of the well-used fold-out couch, pushed away the shredded underbelly that was set to dangle thanks to the family cat, and saw nothing... Blackness. Emptyness. Like staring into a hole where my dreams would go.   Undaunted, I decided it was time to move the couch. A feat that two years prior I was incapable of performing. With my newfound prepubescent strength I wrenched the couch up off the floor (I lifted one side.) and looked underneath. There, laying against the back wall, was a small black case. My heart fluttered as I retrieved it. I clawed it open like an animal. There it was, that purple god of my childhood and all of its plastic children, waiting for me to give them purpose!  That day was great! =D Can't imagine how you feel 40 years later! [end]
[start] I read this with a skeptics mind, the troll in my gut starting to stir, but something else was down there, cut loose, but suddenly there it was again.... emotion.  This is an awesome story. [end]
[start] Your story touches me in some way.  I think all of us have a longing to fix things back in our childhood.    Impossible to achieve, of course, but in your case, you seem to have fixed a small part of your young past. [end]
[start] I don't know if you made this story up or you heard it from somewhere but it didn't happen to you. In your post history or says you're a "young" white male. If you were 10 in 1978 that would make you 50. r/quityourbullshit [end]
[start] Who gave this guy gold?!?  He cleared 200k last year let him buy his own gold. [end]
[start] Great story. [end]
[start] r/Picsoritdidnthappen [end]
[start] The only thing this story did for me was remind me that I'm old AF. Thanks OP. [end]
[start] /r/thatHappened  [end]
[start] Dammit! It’s too early to cry [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing! I love this type of santimental stories so much! [end]
[start] lmao I thought you where talking about actual money until I scrolled down and saw the image  [end]
[start] Hey how about you post this on facebook?? Because no one gives a flying rats ass about your affluent ass and your dumb story. How is this gilded twice? Did you do that, too, op with your 200k/year 5 bedroom 3 car garage? Fucking trash... you know talking about money is the trashiest shit you can do. [end]
[start] Fuck off with the sob story you old pos [end]
[TITLE] I have Coronavirus. [TITLE]
[start] Healthy, active 33-year-old here. I got it too, relatively "mild" symptoms. As far as anyone can tell, I'm out of the woods and officially out of isolation as of yesterday. I second everything you say here, and add from my own experience of SARS back in 2003, this was *way* worse.   These viruses do not fuck around, so we shouldn't either. [end]
[start] I see a lot of people describing the virus where they say after a week they have a day of starting to feel better, and then the following day it knocks them off their feet entirely. I don't remember the term for it, but I've seen people describe this as the body's immune system going into hyperdrive, and that's what's killing people who have healthy immune systems.  *Edit:* Found the term - "cytokine storm." The white blood cells suddenly fight back in large numbers, and this sometimes shuts down the organs and kills the patient. [end]
[start] God damnit. I’m 26,  fit and healthy and have no major health issues. I’m scared for my husband who intubates possible covid patients and is a bit less healthy than I am.  Thank you for your story and I am glad you have recovered. Hopefully others see this and keep up their vigilance [end]
[start] I'm recovered from it. I did everything right to avoid it, but my neighbor did not. He knocked on my door one day with some bad news and surprise hugged me. That's all it took. The whole family got it but it hit me the worst.   I'm 41, 5'4 and 120 lbs.  I lift weights, run and practice yoga. I work out everyday of the week except Saturdays and eat very healthy and it took me down hard.    This virus is no joke. [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing and happy that you are better now!  Today I got into an argument with my mother related to this.  Tomorrow my brother wants to bring his gf here because mum promised her she would show her how to make traditional easter sweets/cakes. I am livid because my other brother is a vulnerable person , plus I suffer from asthma.    They are countering that she spent 3 weeks at home , but for me it is not an assurance as her father still goes to work. I find it pathetic that we have to run a risk for a stupid thing like this. Football leagues got cancelled. F1 Grand prix got cancelled. But apparently my mother's promise cannot be broken.  I will go bang my head somewhere. Stay well op! [end]
[start] I had covid19 and it was bad. First week or so was a fever, with a headache, and feel lousy. Then after a few days I developed a dry cough and there felt an abnormality in my right lung. I couldn’t sleep in certain positions or I would choke. Then I would get shortness of breath. Around that following Friday I decided to call an ambulance because my breathing got so bad I couldn’t do anything and it was getting painful. I went to the ER and I got tested for covid19 and I found out I had pneumonia. The next day in my hospital bed they told me I had covid19. During my hospital stay they gave me meds such as malaria drugs, my regular meds, and antibiotics. I got better after 3 days as my breathing got better. I still needed to take things easily because I still had a shortness of breath.   I’d say to anyone if you get a fever and then it’s followed by shortness of breath call 911 and get to the hospital. Don’t wait it out at home, it can kill you if your body can’t handle pneumonia. [end]
[start] to anyone saying it's like the flu, I got the flu, was healthy as fuck, and nearly died from pneumonia.    here's the problem with being young and healthy: I didn't seek medical help until i was on my ass with a bacterial pneumonia infection that I allowed to develop bc I could tolerate my flu symptoms. [end]
[start] This illness has people so nervous that I hesitated to click on your post. [end]
[start] I'm 45 and relatively healthy although I do have asthma. My experience is similar to yours however no GI symptoms.  Additionally, I had a sore throat and lost my voice 3 times. It's been about 3.5 weeks for me now and I've been getting a little better, then backslide a bit, better, then worse. My doctor is not overly concerned and said it was pretty normal  Really really hoping I'm done with it now! [end]
[start] One of my highschool teachers got coronavirus and is now in the ICU. The guy is not even 40 and is at a serious risk of dying.  Take care people, this shit is serious. [end]
[start] You really should have gone to the hospital once you started having difficulty breathing. General guidelines say you can recover on your own like you did at your home, but once you start experiencing trouble breathing to the extent that you did, you need to get to a hospital.  You're lucky since it sounds like you're getting better, but it could have gone a different direction. [end]
[start] Dude this story actually scares me. I work in law enforcement and I get to deal with all kinds of people everyday, I never know who might pass me the virus and it’s getting into my head lately.  Stay safe folks [end]
[start] I'm 21, workout 5x per week and I have a good immune system.  This shit scares me.  My cousin is a nurse at a hospital and she said 12 of the 16 ICU beds they have are occupied, with around 8 or 9 being COVID-19 patients.   For the first time in my life, my extended family is not celebrating Easter together to keep my grandparents safe. My grandparents have a lot of medical issues and if they get sick, they'll likely die.  The only time any of my family leaves the house is to go to work (my dad's an essential employee), go to the grocery store, pick up a takeout order, or go for a walk. That's it.  Weird times we live in. [end]
[start] Get checked immediately. You have had a lack of oxygen for quite a long time, there will be damage to your brain, lungs and maybe other organs. Even if you didn't have the trouble with catching your breath, you most definitely would have a lack of oxygen without noticing it (yes this actually happens). Your saturation would have been very low even though you had no trouble breathing.  My mom works in a hospital and one of her collegues (the most well renowned lung surgeon of my country) has noticed that people who went through the virus without symptoms also had damage in their lungs, sometimes even brain due to a lack of oxygen. This is very dangerous as it's hazardous to your future health. It's recommended now to get checked if you're sure you had the virus, and saturation levels of risk patients are taken daily.  Please, for your own safety, get it checked out. You don't want to have trouble catching your breath at 35 because a part of your lungs was damaged and not treated properly.  &#x200B;  Oh, and edit: I'm a girl with irrepairable brain damage and damage in my organs due to complications at birth. You do not want to be me. [end]
[start] *cries in essential worker* [end]
[start] See this makes me worry. I like to think I have a good immune system cause I only ever get “sick” once a year and it’s usually a cold or hefty allergy attack. But how would I know if some of these symptoms are related to COVID if I have them regularly? I have diarrhea normally, it comes out solid about as often as most people have diarrhea. I’m fat AF so shortness of breath after light activity such as laundry is normal. I just had pretty bad allergies that I’m still not over so I still have some mucus stuck at the bottom of my throat that makes me cough and my nose went from runny to stuffy during all this. I guess the only way to know for sure to see if this stuff is just my body and not COVID would be to change my diet to cut out lactose to help with the bowls, and to lose a bunch of weight to fix the breathing. [end]
[start] Same here. I’m 32y female, no underlying health conditions. Take no medications. Take vitamins regularly. I workout several times a week, I’m a personal trainer in addition to my day job. I’m fit, active, healthy. I contracted the virus and it also knocked me on my ass for 2 solid weeks. In addition to your symptoms I also had visual disturbances due to brain swelling, another big symptom. Also lost my sense of taste and smell for a couple days. This was this absolute sickest I’ve been since I was a child. [end]
[start] I agree with you, everyone should be careful, young or old. I'm a teenager and I just started showing Covid-19 symptoms. I don't know if it is Covid-19 but I might have been in contact with someone who has it. It started with a fever of 101-99.5 for about 2 days. Now I have a cough and a sore throat.  I don't feel too sick, nothing I can't manage but it's still bad. I don't wanna go get tested because people need that test more than I do. I still strongly advise staying home. It's different from the flu. I've never had a fever for over 1 day and I have a strong immune system. Stay safe everyone and for those who also have it, I hope you guys get better! [end]
[start] Jesus mate why didn’t you call an ambulance at some point if you couldn’t breathe? This is not something to tough out!  Hope you’re on the mend and stay safe! [end]
[start] What state and city u in [end]
[start] This is a weird time in not knowing whether I’m overreacting or under reacting. I’m 26, and had bad asthma as a kid but haven’t had any issues in 8-10 years. I work a desk job, About 2 weeks ago I started having trouble catching the back end of a deep breath. I don’t feel sick or anything other than that, but it freaks me out. Teladoc said it was probably an asthma flair up due to the high pollen levels in Florida, but who knows. [end]
[start] Please report!

[start] We need more testimonials like this.  Too many people aren't taking this seriously enough.  Thank you, OP.  I hope you make a full recovery soon. [end]
[start] Ouch :( I hope you feel better soon [end]
[start] This reads like a horror story. Glad you're on the mend, stay safe and all that stuff [end]
[start] My 81 year old grandma has asthma. I live an hour away but I call her every morning and evening and brought her groceries on Saturday.   I called her this morning and she said she wasn’t feeling well, that her chest was tight but said it was just asthma from the bad winds and took a nebulizer treatment this morning and said it helped a lot but I’m still freaking TF out as I’m sure you can imagine. [end]
[start] I’m glad you’re starting to feel better but I am now concerned for the people you work with since you definitely had it at work when you began experiencing symptoms.. [end]
[start] ...you’re hearing all this news and buzz about all of these cases and not once did you think “hmm, I might have Corona, I’m going to contact a Doctor.” [end]
[start] Get well soon, OP. I am 26 and have the exact same symptoms as you describe. I cannot get a test because I am not in the risk groups and they just tell me to stay home and assume I have the virus. But from the fever coming and going to being completely out of breath is very recognizable. A couple of days ago I was struggling to breathe just sitting down and doing nothing. I couldn't get one sentence out without having to catch my breath. No one is invincible. Stay healthy and safe everybody and OP thank you for sharing. This is a lonely time. I really hope you feel better really soon [end]
[start] I'm 19 with a funky immune system (allergies and athsma) and this terrifies me. My sister goes out to be with her friends everyday and I don't feel like getting killed by someone who lives in the same house as me but didn't care. [end]
[start] You had one of the severe/critical cases. Your symptoms align with the serious cases being reported. Diarrhea, shortness of breathe, high fever and muscle aches.   In more common cases it is much more mild than what you experienced. That said there’s still definitely a chance people can contract this more severe strain, which is exactly why people should be careful.  Edit: I incorrectly referred to there being multiple strains when in fact it is one strain of virus with varying levels of severity on a case to case basis [end]
[start] on the other hand, sen. rand paul (age 54) recently was tested positive for the coronavirus after having a piece of his lung removed. rand paul remains completely asymptomatic despite his condition and positive test results.  the latest best information concerning this virus is that 4 out of 5 people who are infected experience no major symptoms. of those that have major symptoms and subsequently test positive, there is a 3 percent mortality rate. that is to say that the mortality rate of this virus is likely to be 6/1000. according to other medical sources, so far, the virus is not actually effecting death rates in any notable way. if that is true, the only thing that could mean is that that the vast majority of people who die with a coronavirus infection were likely to die very soon anyway. that revelation, if correct, should not be surprising to anyone that understands who other similarly behaving viruses kill.  while anyone can be severely affected by the coronavirus, such as the o.p, you are far more likely to not have a clue that you were even infected without testing. [end]
[start] The “seasonal flu” you think you get is just a cold. [end]
[start] 1. Glad you're healthy and smart. 2. " I have a pretty good immune system so even when I manage to catch the seasonal flu, it never lasts longer than 3 days and is relatively mild for me." Sounds more like you've had colds than the flu. I had the flu back in early December and it wiped me out for almost 2 weeks. I got winded walking a block when I run 15K/week at a high level. The flu isn't a joke. Get your flu shot. [end]
[start] F [end]
[start] I got the virus too. I’m 19 and relatively healthy so luckily my experience was relatively mild and somewhat similar to yours. The thing that scares me is that some younger people (even 10-15 years older than us) will get it and it will be fairly mild and will cause people to take it less seriously.  While we had it relatively easy, my boyfriend’s grandparents (in their 80s) got it and his grandfather has been in the ICU for almost two weeks. It looks like they’re going to pull through, but there are so many people that won’t be as lucky. [end]
[start] Did you not call a doctor at all??? [end]
[start] Did you ever get tested? [end]
[start] I’m so glad your ok!! I work at a healthcare facility that just got its first few positive cases. I’m a type 1 diabetic and my chest feels tight tonight. I’m secretly freaking out 😢😭😭 [end]
[start] I have it too, I lost all sense of taste and smell along with the usual symptoms. My breathings getting more labored. I cant breathe fully because I start coughing..  Im 22 as well. Stay home people. [end]
[start] I'm a Dasher, I deliver food. I currently only have allergies. God it sucks. I feel your pain to some degree. [end]
[start] Your lung may be permanently damaged from the scarring even if you feel recovered. People don't understand how dangerous this coronavirus is. [end]
[start] Im 22 too... Im scared [end]
[start] My boyfriend has been smoking for 20 years, is relatively unhealthy and underweight. I can't come to terms with the fact that he'll most likely die if he gets ill. He's my everything, I'd rather die myself. I don't know how to survive this year. [end]
[start] "Had Corona. Stayed home. Was fine.   Seriously, don't think you're invincible to this. Just I am" ? [end]
[start] Curious why you didn't seek medical attention throughout this ordeal? Especially since you live with a roommate. I mean call the medical authorities to alert them to your condition. [end]
[start] same [end]
[start] thank you for your story. i have been tryibg to tell people this is not a good thing, and my family especially keeps telling me and my girlfriend that we are young and healthy, we will be okay. im 23 and my girlfriend is 22, so im going to definitely take this to heart. i haven't left my house besides the small corner store and im planning to order my groceries for pick up to try and avoid the store. every day though im nervous that ive already brought something home and im just waiting for the symptoms to show... [end]
[start] I think I have it as well, but it's been a bit different for me.  First week I had 3 days of exhaustion and I could feel some tightness in my chest.  It went away, and then a week later I got exhausted again that lasted 2 days, and then better.  Now i'm into week 3 and there was one day that I got exhausted again but body aches.  I think this is something that takes many weeks to overcome, and is not like your typical flu. [end]
[start] I am from Columbus Ohio!! I have asthma do u think it would be harder to survive the sickness ?? [end]
[start] Very scary. I have been having some issues with breathing also right now. For the past couple days I've been feeling almost a kind of tightness in my chest. It feels like I can't get enough air in. I have asthma so I'm assuming maybe it's just that since I was running around a few days ago. Still pretty scary [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing your experience and I hope you and your roommate stay well. [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing. I'm so glad you both survived it. 🙏 [end]
[start] Well done for getting through that, I have no idea who you are but I'm proud of you. [end]
[start] So I just went through something very similar, but I had a wet cough. Lots of gunk being coughed up. My wife seemed to think it was pneumonia, and not coronavirus. But everything else pretty much lined up. It took me 2 weeks to start feeling better, and I'm still on the mend. [end]
[start] I’m 18 and healthy (play multiple sports and work out) and I think I got it too. The doctor said I had all the symptoms and said I most likely have it but they refused to test me. Even so, I appreciate the message! Anyone can can get it and it’s not fun [end]
[start] Do you have asthms [end]
[start] question, did you take any kind of meds? [end]
[start] so it's your roommate first or you first who got it? [end]
[start] Just know that you still may be infectious. We haven't quite figured that part out (ie: if you get it, can you get it again.) [end]
[start] Could you explain the pains in the back?? Location and feeling [end]
[start] mercy, feel better [end]
[start] What did you take for recovery? [end]
[start] ❤❤glad your better.. [end]
[start] > I have a pretty good immune system so even when I manage to catch the seasonal flu, it never lasts longer than 3 days and is relatively mild for me  Do you get tested and confirm that it's the flu? I'm 38 and have only ever had it once in my entire life, the way you say that makes it seem like you get it semi-regularly, but what you describe sounds like just a common cold.  If that's how you experience the flu, wow, count yourself lucky! [end]
[start] I want to sing your name from the mountaintops for taking the time to say this. I've been warning my co-workers about this exactly. Thank god I seem to have gotten through to them but yeah, people need to hear this. Thank you.  If even 1 person see's this and rethinks their approach to this thing, adds a bit more caution, something, anything... you'll have potentially done more good than you know.  Are you okay now? O.o How's your breathing? [end]
[start] People compare it to the flu, and I generally tell them two things:  1. Its much much worse than the flu.  It'll be like you can't breath and coughing razor blades and you'll have the symptoms of the flu.  2. The flu sucks ass and can kill you. I was fit as a fiddle and lost 20 lbs puking and shaking when I had the flu. Everything ached and I could hardly move for almost a week.  I couldn't keep down food.  The flu fucking sucks.  Also, see #1.  Thats why I get a flu shot every year.  Thats why I'll be fucking first in line when they come out with a covid19 vaccine. [end]
[start] and I have to go to work undoubtedly until this shit blows over or i get it and cant work, super stoked. [end]
[start] How do you think you got it? Cuz if you got it while just going for a walk this worries me, I should probably stop going for walks [end]
[start] Hope you’re doing ok. I had a low fever 24 hours ago, diarrhea and body pains but I am feeling very normal today. It’s scaring the shit out of me as I am with my old parents, my nieces and my 5 month old baby. [end]
[start] You say you don't know how you or your roommate got it. Can you speculate? Are either of you working? Did you go for groceries in the 2 weeks prior? [end]
[start] "Managed to convince his doctor" lol, no wonder this shit spreading like wildfire [end]
[start] I know of a healthy 22 year old who's now on a ventilator. I'm glad youre on the way up. Stay safe everyone [end]
[start] I don't now if I got coronavirus, but got nailed with a bug about 5 weeks ago. I'm in my 40s and don't get many colds.  This was the worst I'd had in 10+ years, but lasted only a few days. Curious if anyone has had similar expeirences, and knows if this is coronavirus vs. flu?  It started off as a dry cough on day 1.  On day 2, I couldn't stop coughing.  Took over-the-counter meds. Got really weak and couldn't eat.  For two days could get little more than a few teaspoons of soup down.  My skin was hyper-sensitive to the touch (but not body aches), which I'd never felt before when having a cold.   When I could eat again, I lost sensation of taste (not completely, but sweets had no flavor).  The intense part of it lasted 2 days.  Sensitivity and lack of taste lasted maybe a week.  A solid cough lasted for close to two weeks.  My right lung initially felt bruised (upper section of lung) then slowly that feeling stated to fade.  It's still feels a little bruised and lung capacity doesn't feel 100%, as I still get a tingly feeling when breathing deep.    Does it sound like coronavirus, or is this just a bad flu? [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing your experience [end]
[start] I'm so sorry you're going through that. Stay strong and I hope it goes as well as it can!! [end]
[start] How is your roommate doing? Are his symptoms same, worse or nothing? Hearing many people are responding to it differently. [end]
[start] You're really lucky you didn't deteriorate to needing a vent with those symptoms.  If possible, I would also seek out a pulmonologist to check for any permanent lung damage which is becoming a known thing with COVID-19. Sooner rather than later. Source-Im an rn at an all covid hospital in western ny [end]
[start] Ffs. I definitely have it. Doctor waved it off as a cold. [end]
[start] You have been banned from r/nevergotthevirus [end]
[start] Are you in SF and also can you cough on my manager? [end]
[start] Buy Vitamin D supplement 4000iu and eat two tangerines per day. If you start feeling sick take paracetamol. That is what I have done and I think I have beaten it. [end]
[start] dude, when there’s a fucking virus going around with “flu like symptoms” why would you just assume it’s just the flu? especially when you had the most tell tale symptom, shortness of breath. you should have called your doctor right away that way all the people at work or in public you exposed while coughing can get tested and the place disinfected as soon as possible. you’re putting other people’s lives at risk by being stubborn. [end]
[start] There are some people in r/GoForGold giving awards if you prove that you have it. If you want to, you can go claim it. [end]
[start] You're 22 saying that you never get sick, that's like saying nothing. If you get sick easily at your age there is something wrong with you. I don't think I was ever sick until late in my 30s, besides the usual children's sickies when I was under 5. Wait and see, my friend. [end]
[start] Anyone you know with it or anything can you try recommending actemra to them theirs something strange going on and it isn’t getting the publicity it’s needing coz it’s saving lives [end]
[start] Just remember that they want us to get infected to keep the economy rolling for them. [end]
[start] Hi [end]
[start] Yep...that's how the flu works. [end]
[start] Hey OP  Prove it. [end]
[start] Please for the love of god tell me you contacted your work and your state’s COVID hotline. You, unknowingly, exposed people to the disease and they need to know. Otherwise you could be patient zero for a new hotspot [end]
[start] Odd way to perpetuate a fear monger, pandering P.S.A. [end]
[start] So, you haven't had a test yet and you are self diagnosing?   Your roommate is lucky to get a test, I know someone who had trouble breathing, all the other symptoms,  went to the doc, and they got discharged with no ventilator and not even a  test [end]
[start] I had the Chinese Flu too and it wasn't that bad. Take some mucinex sit in a steamed shower... you'll be fine. [end]
[start] Nice lie post, coronavirus isn't real [end]
[start] Wow imagine shutting down a whole economy because if you get sick it’s hard to breathe for 3 days [end]
[TITLE] Growing up my parents were poor, I was made fun of for being on the free lunch program in school. In college my girlfriend broke up with me saying I didn’t work hard enough. Now I’m 25, almost 3 years out of college making $160k a year as an engineer in the tech industry. [TITLE]
[start] Dude, *congratulations.* I know what it's like to eat free lunch, and to work hard for a dream I've achieved. You deserve a million people to cheer for you. I'm one of them. [end]
[start] Good for you! Glad to hear!  Try not to waste time with resentment. You success is the best answer to all those taunts. That's an argument that speaks for itself. [end]
[start] I think it's so rude when people make fun of someone just because they're on the free lunch program like mind your own business. That being said, I'm glad that you're making something of yourself. That's something to be proud of! [end]
[start] As they say, living well is the best revenge. You don’t have to prove anything to anyone else. You’ve proven to yourself that you have value, that the others were wrong. Rather than think about the terrible people in your past, think about the people in your life now. Be the person to them that you didn’t have. Be the support and encouragement that others need. You know how not to treat others, so do the opposite. Be remembered as a good person.   I’m happy for you, OP. [end]
[start] Imagine growing up not missing those things, and turning up a fuck up. I would rather be you. You owe part of your success to your hardship. Your haters also made you. Love them and yes laugh at them too. [end]
[start] Pardon my language but fuck yea! Good job stranger, proud of you! [end]
[start] *Don’t* let those chips on your shoulder control the rest your life. Be generous to the people you love and the people who supported you, but try not to rub it in onto others. Nobody important cares how much money you make or how much cool shit you have.  That being said, congratulations! [end]
[start] Go to therapy. It helps so much. I’m really happy for you though. [end]
[start] We so proud of you! [end]
[start] Word.  I grew up poor too, free lunch, whole 9 yards.  First in my family to graduate college, making around 100k a year, married to a beautiful wonderful woman with two awesome shithead daughters.  Worked. My. Ass. Off.  Thing to remember is even though we both worked for everything we had, lots of folks had / have it even worse and even of they work as hard as we did, the odds are still stacked heavily against them.  Be proud. I am.  Be thankful. I am.  Work to help unstack the odds for those like us who weren’t as lucky. [end]
[start] Just don’t become a republican and cut the school lunch program, mmkay. [end]
[start] Congratulations! You’re doing amazing. Me and my sisters were in teased growing up, we lived in a condemned home for many years and have been homeless( only for a summer and a few months). All three of us have made it out of the working poor class, but not as high as you. Hats off! [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I don't ge it. If you feel that you are a better person now because you are wealhty, didn't you just prove they were right to make fun of you? [end]
[start] This might be an unpopular question, but if you answer it would be awesome and totally worth any negative Karma I may receive.  After all of this, where do you stand politically? Did it change?   Lastly, did your girlfriends words change you?   It is entirely possible in my mind that maybe her words were true, maybe they weren’t, but earning the 160k was only meant to say “Fuck you” to her and all those people who made fun of you at school. This post is just a way for you to feel what it might be like to say that. [end]
[start] I used a therapist to work through my anger and bitterness. I did the same thing as you though I don't make as much. It's a simple life and I'm content. I'm glad you got out man. It's so hard. [end]
[start] Does your ex from college know you're doing so well financially? [end]
[start] Congrats, you did extraordinarily well as making it through difficult circumstances is a huge obstacle growing up. Hope all will be well for you in the future 👍 [end]
[start] Shout out to all the poor kids on food stamps and shit. Go you, man. [end]
[start] Look no further than the 2014 Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl champions. Full of people with chips on their shoulders.  It's what motivates real winners.  You will achieve things because you work harder than anyone it was ever just handed to. [end]
[start] Good for you.  You can buy your own fucking trophy though :P [end]
[start] Shit bro good job, but that ain’t half as bad compared to others .  99% of kids are on the free lunch program now in days so , that’s not too much of setback haha [end]
[start] OP do you listen to Dax Shepard's podcast, armchair expert? He talks a lot about growing up poor and with a crappy family situation most of the time and how he continues to have a chip on his shoulder about that. It's really interesting to hear how vulnerable and self aware he is about that same thing. If nobody in your life says it, you're a badass and your fellow redditors are proud! Keep doing the damn thing. [end]
[start] Congratulations, my dude! I was raised in similar circunstances, was cheated on by my first gf when I was at Uni and she said it was because I never had money to take her to parties, and my last gf, which I recently broke up with was starting to treat me like shit, and once said, in front of her whole family, that I was broke and she didn't want to date a broke guy (yes, i broke up with her soon after that). I was making living wage back when my ex said that, and now I'm making a bit more than double that. I'm still just starting my career as a Mechanical Engineer, and my country is in a crisis right now, but I'm doing pretty well for myself. Do your best, my dude! You are an inspiration to people like us when we were younger! [end]
[start] Congrats, as for the chip on your shoulder, just relax and it should go away. You don’t need to prove anything to anyone. Just enjoy life. People will always be haters, ignore them and only allow good people into your life. [end]
[start] Who the hell makes fun of people being on the free lunch program? Almost everyone at my school is on it and most of them are filthy rich. [end]
[start] Dude wtf I was told there’s no such thing as a free lunch [end]
[start] your value is unrelated to the amount of money you have [end]
[start] You should be proud of yourself! You did it! There is nothing in this world so satisfying as knowing you achieved your goals. Whatever you do from here, remember that free lunch & safety nets helped get you here. As someone who has a similar story, I’ve made my focus in life to try to be the person I needed for me when I was coming up in every situation. It makes for a very rewarding life! [end]
[start] Don't measure yourself by how much money you make. Nobody likes those people. [end]
[start] Nothing wrong with having a chip on your shoulder. Sounds like you've used it to your advantage.   Sounds like it's time to take some of that cash and start investing.   Out of curiosity what type of engineering are you in? [end]
[start] People talk and you don't always have to listen.  When you do though you learn things. Maybe it was how to cope with reality and motivation for a different day.  Either way, what do you have to say to those going through the same steps? Your younger self.  Hope your days are full of smiles. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I'm just wondering how and why should kids know about the status of a lunch account? Parents pay into the account. No child should know about another child's account. The adults in charge are the problem, in my opinion. [end]
[start] *pat* [end]
[start] Keep in mind only a few made fun the vast majority were clueless and still are [end]
[start] Dude your most likely doing better than any of those people just forget about the past and start focusing on the present and future enjoy everything you can and most importantly just have fun [end]
[start] The best part is you will always be smart with your money because you know what’s it’s like to mot have any. [end]
[start] People who make fun of others have insecurities about themselves. It was not about you it was about them the entire time. Forget that stuff and live your best life. Stay hungry and great work! [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Fuck yes bro.  All those little shits in school never amount to anything.  They feed on everyone else and it’s not until they are left alone that they finally realise that their whole life was one big cuntish affair.   Glad you bossed it.  Hope one of those bullies gets to see you pushing a gleaming new whip around town someday.   Peace [end]
[start] >But I still have chips on my shoulder about the way I was treated growing up and by the people around me.  The best thing to do here is to treat the people you encounter the way you wanted to be treated.  Keep up the hard work. [end]
[start] You Rock...keep your head held high, you earned your way here.  Life's lessons helped you to become a strong, self reliant person.  Surround yourself with positive people.  Keep on being you! [end]
[start] Congratulations! My opinion the best way to seek healing revenge is to go out and help some other struggling family, student. One might tutor for free, pay a child's lunch bill, help a student whose ambition, hopes and dreams of ever going to college is going down the tubes.   Being the ambitious, hard working, courageous, successful person you are could do alot in uplifting your community's struggles. I am not saying take on the world or take on other people's problem, however, being an example of one uplifting themselves out of poverty to live a fruitful life than you may just heal your own pain.  Best revenge to those who have snubbed you along the way is knowing how helping 1 could add up to helping 500 if everyone pays it forward.  I don't know if you're a fan of Barrack Obama, Jimmy Carter however their words and actions of paying it forward have had tremendous healing powers!  I hope this is food for thought 🤗 and yes you do have a right to be very proud of yourself! [end]
[start] When I was in high school I bumped into one of the ‘cool’ girls who was wearing a Nike jacket (very cool in 1995!) and she turned to me and said ‘don’t touch what you can’t afford’. Shit like that stays with you forever and along with free lunches and generally just growing up very poor I get the whole chip on the shoulder thing.  You know you’ll do everything you can to not end up like that. It’s stopped me having children until now at a slightly later than ideal point in life as I was too scared that I wouldn’t be able to support them even though I’m happily married.  It’s also made me work my ass off like you have which is awesome but it also means you put a lot of pressure on yourself to succeed.  Just look after yourself and know that all those old negative experiences have shaped who you are today. [end]
[start] What was the mental process that inspired the work ethic? I get the motivation behind it, but how did it play out in your head? [end]
[start] You fucking rock! Good job! [end]
[start] Fuck yeah you did. You did it, man, no one can take that from you. Congratulations, you must of worked your ass off for it! [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Nice. And here I am, a person from poverty that stayed in poverty. It really happens only to some people. [end]
[start] What degree did you work on? I’m curious because I’m in my 3rd year of college for engineering technology as of right now also congrats on that long haul well deserved! [end]
[start] congrats! what’s you job title? [end]
[start] Similar situation. It doesn’t pay to be resentful, enjoy your success and try not to let it affect your decision making. Some people tend to overcompensate and become super sucks. Some people turn into squirrels and refuse to spend in case they go back to where they were. Enjoy your life now, only look back to see how far you have come. [end]
[start] What city are you in? The bay? [end]
[start] Go see a therapist and process this. You've worked too hard to let old thinking and feelings destroy your future.  All the best to you. it is really worth it to work thru this. [end]
[start] Congratulations!  Started from the bottom now you're here.  Only tip -- it's not about how much you make, it's about how much you save.  Head over to r/financialindependence and stack bundles [end]
[start] Fuck those people. They’re not worth worrying about. You did it my guy! All those experiences, even the bad ones, shaped you into the person you are today. You have proved to yourself that no matter what anyone says to you, or says what you can or cannot do, that you can achieve anything. Congrats my dude!! [end]
[start] My story is very similar to yours. Unfortunately, the ending is a bit different. I’m 35 and still struggling. I’m in school working towards a computer science degree. Thanks for the inspiration man. Congrats!! [end]
[start] YAY!! Im still on the journey, but i believe in it and it brings me some peace [end]
[start] Now I know context is key but that really just sounds so shallow of her to do that. Always sucks when people constantly assume you’re not good enough... well now YOU can decide who’s good enough and who’s not :)   You’re gonna be making more money then that too eventually with the path you’re on. As far as I see it, you left behind nothing important ;) [end]
[start] What do you do in the tech industry? Congratulations by the way that is awesome. [end]
[start] Wow that's awesome. You should be proud of yourself. [end]
[start] Congratulations OP. My family was on welfare when I was a kid and that’s a long road.  That said, it’s probably not a great sign that you didn’t have anyone else to tell. You made it financially, but make sure you have rich relationships and support group in your life too. I make in your ballpark and everyone is different, but the friends and family in my life always meant so much more than the money. [end]
[start] First, congratulations.  Second, fuck those people.  Third, get the chip off by paying it forward. Volunteer, donate, or check out mentoring programs. At the very very minimum, never ever treat anyone the way you were treated and go out of your way to do the exact opposite.  Again, congratulations. [end]
[start] I have a legitimate question, I’m a sophomore in high school and I want to make a four figure salary being an engineer, any suggestions? [end]
[start] Success is the best revenge. Congrats on the success, you deserve to be proud of yourself! [end]
[start] I thought I made it with a job at Microsoft out of college, and I made half that! Great job!   Just remember, in today's job market you're always replaceable. The hr dept is there to protect the company. The real way to move up and make serious money is to switch companies, or at least a different job in the company [end]
[start] Good fucking shit my guy! [end]
[start] Congratulations! This made my day! [end]
[start] What did you major in? [end]
[start] Let it go....you will not truly enjoy your life until you do! [end]
[start] Kill them with success and bury them with a smile. Well done! [end]
[start] Congratulations on your strong income! I'm wondering - are you also saving? There are plenty of broke people with strong incomes, meaning they spend the whole thing. Make sure you are also saving so that you are never broke [end]
[start] “You didn’t work hard enough” tends to be a statement people make based on your wealth not your actual hard work. Disappointing since a lot of hard working people are broke. [end]
[start] You are my favorite kind of people. [end]
[start] What engineering did you do specifically? [end]
[start] Really good for you! I aspire to be hardworking like you! [end]
[start] glad for you =)   this is gonna sound odd, but try to forgive the kids who have you shit growing up. high school and even early college age kids are not fully formed yet. they are easily influenced and can fall right in with kids who tease, because they lack the confidence to stand against it. people can be so shitty at 18 and super nice ten years later. not all of them, but a lot of them. they just need time to grow some self awareness and understanding. [end]
[start] Omfg wow dude [end]
[start] You have your whole life ahead of you to surround yourself with positive, supportive people. You can go ahead and erase everyone up until now from your history. You won’t remember them in 10 years. Good fuckin job, man. [end]
[start] You are amazing [end]
[start] as they say, success is the best revenge [end]
[start] F#@king kill ot bra! [end]
[start] Bro, I think kids who make fun of the other kids in the free lunch program are stupid. You're getting free lunch while their parents are stuck paying 30+ a month for a disgusting ass slice of pizza that most of the times they didn't even enjoy, don't be stupid, geez. I'm sorry you were surrounded by stupid kids.   I'm also sorry that your ex was stupid, at least the whole situation served as a means to know that you weren't meant to be.   I'm proud of you for making it *real good* in this cold, hard world. Leave those people who hurt you out of ignorance in the past, and focus on enjoying your financial stability and freedom now, and in finding more things that will make you feel more proud and more happy! [end]
[start] Good shit man the cleanest of shits [end]
[start] Congratulations. The hardest working and most ambitious people I know are ones that had similar experiences to yours.    It's hard to ever let the impact of that treatment go, but I think channeling into the whole revenge by success and living well is a healthy outlet. [end]
[start] *in a cheerleader outfit*  You go you AMAZING PERSON!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS A TON! [end]
[start] You go man. Reading this makes me so happy for you. Being poor is shit. Being treated like shit is even worse [end]
[start] So as an engineer what were your grades. I have a son who really wants to do that [end]
[start] Just keep doing u man. Congrats, my story is similar to the urs but I run a small biz. [end]
[start] First, **congratulations** mate, you deserve it.   Second, I´m in a similar situation, can you please tell me how you did it?, Recommend me something?. Anything a warrior like you can say will surely help me.   (hit me up in pm if you are ok). [end]
[start] Well done you!  Everything you have now, you've earned, and no one can take that away.  I hope you meet your ex, and you can rub her nose in what you have done for yourself.  Stay smiling, you got this. [end]
[start] love this [end]
[start] Good for you! I was always laughed at becuase my family couldn't afford fancy holidays, I didn't leave the country until I was 20 and could pay for it myself. Years on I'm in the process of buying my next family home and my parents have offered to help considerably with the purchase which they can do due to scrimping when we were younger and paying off their mortgage early! [end]
[start] Is $160k a lot? [end]
[start] I think we are all proud of you brother. [end]
[start] I remember one of my high school best friend literally told me she feels that her and I are different in ways that she was raised “better” and her family is just on a different level than mine in all aspects. (To be honest, both of my parents had higher education than her parents, but they were just richer.) I did go through the “I wish she can see me now” phase. But to be honest, as mad I was of her statement, it did make me want to make something more of myself to proof her wrong. Sometimes having crazy driven motivation is a good thing. [end]
[start] Congrats. A lot of empirical research suggests that you're making more than necessary to be happy (75k) or satisfied with your life (105k). Please consider using your extra to help those kids growing up in similar positions to their own. Not all of them can or should pursue what you pursued, but their wellbeing matters just as much as your own.   Once again, congrats and may you live a good and loving life. [end]
[start] I'm so happy for and proud of you!  &#x200B;  Keep kicking ass and taking names! [end]
[start] Well the same ones who made fun of you for being poor are the same ones who probably have to rely on state welfare to get by, even though they’re more than capable of working. You’re someone with drive and intelligence, something they won’t have. You deserve all that and more, you persevered despite your difficult environment. Congratulations. [end]
[start] Just because other people mistreated you doesn’t mean you should mistreat yourself I have nothing but admiration for you. I hope you achieve what you are looking for [end]
[start] Dude congratulations, seriously. Don't be resentful of the past but use that as fuel to keep progressing. I did the exact same thing, coming from similar background. [end]
[start] I'm so fucking happy to hear that, and fuck all those ppl who underestimate you. Coming from the bottom and now you here [end]
[start] hey you sound similar to me.....best wishes to you [end]
[start] Good work, keep it up. Focus on who you are now and actively choose to be around the people who brings up the best out of you. [end]
[start] Congrats! [end]
[start] The same story with me, but for I am still working harder harder my time is soon to come. [end]
[start] Good job now find someone going through it and lift them up.  Show them how it’s done and pay it forward.  Oh yeah and fuck all of them that tried to drag you down!!!! [end]
[start] From someone who's been there, to someone over half there and feeling the same emerging sense of I finally fucking did it (at 31). Congratulations and hope you can treat yourself without guilt. You showed more than anyone else that you yourself can do it and be confident in yourself. That's priceless. That confidence paid off in reality and I'm so happy for you. Good on you for not falling into the pits of poverty hell and repeating the cycle. I finally am getting closure myself and close to the finish line. So damn close. Cheers! [end]
[start] Fuck yes! You go boy. Did you know that it's a statistical fact that the socioeconomic status to which you're born, is the socioeconomic status to which you will die? You my friend are a great success. [end]
[start] Her loss!  Just remember not all gals are like that! [end]
[start] I'm not sure if this will be any help, but I haven't shared these with anyone and it's good to know I'm not alone. I grew up in a boarding school, and had no friends, I always wondered why, till I treated them to a lunch of sorts from 5 months of my pocket money, (my parents weren't rich but they did everything they could for me to get the best education). After this the bullying stopped for a while, people were nice to me. That's when it hit me 4 years of bullying and thinking of a reason as to why gave me some sense of answer. I never had close friends in my life. 3 years out of college, I'm not as successful as you are, but I make enough money to support my family,help my father setup his dream business.  The chip on my shoulder is still not having the privileges my friends used to have, the stuff they owned like a ps4, a flat screen TV, a nice bike, a car, the ability to drink in a pub and the list goes on. I feel incomplete, I feel like I haven't achieved anything since I haven't lived my life to the fullest. But seeing the satisfaction in my parents eyes makes me happy, knowing their investments didn't go in vain. They've struggled a lot in their life, now it's my time to keep them happy.  Sorry for the long post. But dude congratulations man, awesome job getting everything on track. Good luck for you future endeavours. [end]
[start] Well if you're an engineer...you definitely don't work hard enough 😆 [end]
[start] Could be my story. One thing to watch out for - wisely using that money. We were never taught how. Make sure you are saving. Survivors guilt has led me to make some rough choices. [end]
[start] You ROCK!!! [end]
[start] Treat poor people well. [end]
[start] Don't usually comment on this shit cuz I think it's mostly cringe. But something about this made me happy and happy for you. Good job my dude now get a nice car and go to the gym and fuck any girl with a pulse. And youll live a life free of regret my friend. [end]
[start] I know you don't know me, but I'm proud of you.  :) [end]
[start] Congrats! So happy for you! You did it and we're all proud of you! [end]
[start] I grew up the same way, welfare, section 8. My parents did their best to raise us (6 of us)Every struggle has a lesson and I’m forever greatful to my parents for that. I turned out to be a great person and so are my siblings and I’m sure you are too. Get what your worth and drop the toxic people In your life. And I’m proud of you!! [end]
[start] As a politician who has previously sought a blue collar job, I can confirm - mortals are delusional as fuck.  I have been called "trying too hard" and "trying not hard enough" at the same time by different people.  I have also been called "racist" by white supremacists. WTF?  Finally, after getting into the blue collar worker environment - I felt like a super-intelligent alien. I was surrounded by people who were unable to communicate at all. It was the one shouting louder, who was right, not the one who actually knew what to do. [end]
[start] GO FREAKIN CELEBRATE EVERYDAY!!! SO PROUD OF YOU! [end]
[start] I'm very happy for you. [end]
[start] Fuckem! Your self made be a indulgent, but frugal MAN buy yourself something NICE every payday [end]
[start] BIG congratulations! ALL that crap is in your rear view mirror, becoming smaller,,,,,, [end]
[start] Holy shit dude you are AMAZING!!!! YOU DID IT!!!!! [end]
[start] Same boat man, I’m glad people bashed me. I went the sasuke route and achieved out of hate. Because i felt that I could prove them wrong it would hurt them back. Don’t even know those ppl anymore but they can suck my successful slong [end]
[start] Dude I totally feel you. I got bullied in high school also, and that’s where my ambitions started. Congratulations !! [end]
[start] Funny I grew up getting free school lunch and guess what I make great money now and my company provides free breakfast and lunches. Still riding the free meals. [end]
[start] Dude congrats. For real way to show them what you’re worth [end]
[start] It would be amazing if you could get back with your ex and break up with her and say “You don’t work hard enough”. [end]
[start] Well done that’s a amazing.  We were pretty poor growing up. I was always embarrassed on school trips etc where we had to bring our own lunch. Ours would alway be barely anything and the value striped super cheap shop brand stuff.  As an adult, well even as a child, all I wanted to do was do better for my own children. In a lot of ways I have , we own a home, I work etc. However, I haven’t dealt with it quite as well and have got into a lot of debt just overspending getting whatever they/I want. Think half the reason is stress and half is childhood! I seem to panic even now (mid 30s) when we’re low on something in the kitchen. You should be super proud of yourself for what you’ve accomplished 👍💪 [end]
[start] Please keep looking ahead and don’t let the ineptness of others drag you down. You have so much more ahead of you to enjoy than what you’ve left behind you. My husband grew up poor. His dad walked out on his family, so mom had to take on several jobs to provide for him and his sisters. In the 1950’s there was no free meals at school and there was no child support, but there was discrimination and being shunned if you didn’t come from a 2-parent household. He didn’t have friends because he spent most of his time taking care of his sisters, and his mom didn’t let him go to parties because they couldn’t afford presents nor were they able to reciprocate the invitations. His saving grace was that he  qualified for a full scholarship to USC. Yes, he earned his degree and started successfully working, but then he kept getting himself over educated for the next 38 years, earning multiple degrees, up to 2 doctoral degrees, because it was his way of proving himself to the kids who made fun of him and to so many of the teachers who looked down upon. He’s definitely comfortable financially, yet he’s never been able to appreciate it or enjoy it. His enjoyment mostly comes from seeing me and the kids well provided for. It seems like that childhood trauma killed a part of his spirit that he’s never been able to recover. It’s sad how the world can permanently injure us. [end]
[start] I'm sorry you had to get bullied because of being in the free lunch program. In my side nobody really asks anything about that and if they do they just accept it, many kids are on it. [end]
[start] Yes you did! Internet stranger... proud of you :) [end]
[start] This made me so happy to read, I teared up. SO HAPPY FOR YOU! [end]
[start] *Congratulations by Post Malone playing in the background* [end]
[start] Obviously I don't know you, but maybe it's time to go back to your old community and volunteer.  Show other kids that are in similar situations that you can do well.  It won't change the past but might make you feel better about the current. [end]
[start] I'm a grandfather. I am so proud of you. You have worked hard and done well.  Now please do not be like those that picked on you.  I don't know if you have kids or might have some but can you imagine how awesome they will be if you can knock that chip off your shoulder and raise them up in a better world? [end]
[start] Good for you 🙄 [end]
[start] Congrats, easy claps brother. Hope your past events won’t affect or keep on affecting your mental, you are a great man which became someone of no one. Congrats once again. [end]
[start] I understand. I grew up poor as well. I get so pissed when I hear "white privilege". I was treated like dirt. I recall walking home and being ridiculed as I walked home because of where I lived. Never had the right sneakers to have friends. I recall one Christmas making a picture for my teacher for a Christmas gift and all the other kids laughing at me. I learned very young to stand alone. I too have been very successful. A CEO, a CIO. However, I will tell you, to this day, I work with others, but I always stand alone. I do not care what the crowd does. Nothing was handed to me. I worked my ass off with the one goal of getting out of the hell I was in and making sure my children never had to experience that. Kudos to you my friend. You prevailed. Poverty leaves PTSD. [end]
[start] Proud of you [end]
[start] I plan on doing the same...working hard to show that I’m not a lazy piece of shit [end]
[start] >I fucking did it.  &#x200B;  >I don’t really have anyone else to tell  You sure? [end]
[start] >Growing up my parents were poor, I was made fun of for being on the free lunch program in school. In college my girlfriend broke up with me saying I didn’t work hard enough. Now I’m 25, almost 3 years out of college making $160k a year as an engineer in the tech industry.  "And all I have to say for you all that treated me like shit is...**FUCK YOU ASSHOLES!!!SEE THE MONEY?!SEE THE MONEY?!HERE'S TO Y'ALL THAT TRIED TO MAKE ME FAIL, 🖕🖕🖕🖕!!!!**"" [end]
[start] Atta boy! I will PM in some time with something that might help even a little bit more [end]
[start] I know how you feel, and this is what got me over all my chips:  My family were all drug addicts. They would look at me, and get upset that I didn't partake in drugs. I joined the military and had a decent career there but got out after 4 years because it wasn't for me. There I learned that I fucking hated working in technology.  I got a job in my home town making 80k a year and all they did was literally gas light and neg me for it ***\*DESPITE\**** the fact that it was not only in the field that I was working towards a degree in, but I was going to college for and had a 3.5gpa in.  They all treat me as if I'm some alien because I don't want anything to do with them now. They all routinely talk about how "they knew" I would "be a failure." They will tell me this every opportunity I get about how "you could do so much more if you weren't such a fuck up."  I've even had them say things like "I would have been better than you if only I were as \[whatever\] as you. You are lucky that is the only difference between us." This occurs every time I talk to them. What they don't see is that no action I've taken has ever success or failure due to luck.  Luck goes to those that work the hardest.  Little to their knowledge my wife and I both believe that I'm about a year away from being good enough to walk in with a portfolio and get a job somewhere with my art alone (despite not having a degree.)  Lets talk about what kind of failure I am:  1. I'm that failure that has 250 college credits across three fields: Math, Philosophy, and Psychology (1000 level classes in each). I have all the equivilant credits for a 2 yeard degree in psych, but 75% of a masters. (3.5 GPA) 2. I'm that failure that stopped doing all of that because I realized I didn't like it, and enjoyed drawing, painting, and art far more. (Philosophy too, but I listen to audio books while I work) 3. I'm that failure that has managed to sell art works. 4. I'm that failure that is the only one in my entire family (that I know of, even distant relatives) that has a stable relationship. 5. I'm that failure that married 10 years younger than myself, and to a woman who looks better than me. 6. I'm that failure that married a woman who is in the medical field and makes good money doing what she does. (She graduated with the highest honors \[Suma Kum Lade\] from her program and is literally a scientist) 7. I'm that failure that has lived in other countries, speaks two languages (rare where I'm from), and has traveled most of the world, but never managed to "stay" in a different country. 8. I'm that failure that is happy because I'm just a lucky dope, and not because I put effort in. 9. I'm that failure that could have been so much more.  In reality, the only thing I've succeed at is doing what I love in the moment, and living in the moment. No one can be more, no one can be less. There is only now. There isn't a 'higher' or 'better' self. Self improvement doesn't exist. To put it another way (and to steal from stargate) "When you know the fire is warmth the meal was cooked a long time ago" If you know how to be better, actually KNOW how to do that, then you will just be better. If you aren't better its because there isn't a better.  They are:  1. They are that failure that can't hold a stable job. 2. They are that failure that has never left their home town. 3. They are failure that knows exactly what to do, but simply cannot execute. 4. They are that failure that let mere luck keep them down. 5. They are that failure that can't keep other people out of their business. 6. They are that failure that knows exactly what everyone needs to be doing at all times, and what would be 'best' for them, but can't get it right for themselves. 7. They are that failure that no matter how hard they try they just cant get anything done. 8. They are that failure that lets their ego, and expectations get in the way of their actions. 9. They are that failure that couldn't be more regardless of effort.  This realization came to me when my wifes father's girlfriend (both druggys as well) basically started talking shit about me, to my wifes brothers. I looked at my wife and said "Your Dad barely knows me, and his girlfriend has literally never spoken to me or you." When we show up to family events, if his girlfriend doesn't throw a tantrum at our presence, she leaves. Usually both.  I couldn't stop laughing about her talking shit. It genuinely made me feel better like "I can't really be messing my life up that bad if shes so angry about it." and it just 'occurred' to me. My family, Her, My druggie in laws -They don't talk shit because they are upset that "I didn't do better" and neg me, but because they are jealous and think "Oh given the opportunity!" but over look I dug those opportunity with a fucking shovel and hard work.  As a parable: They would complain constantly that I could dig in a different spot and find more gold. And if that were true then why aren't they there digging themselves? Every time I would find a nugget of gold, they knew if I just dug in a different place I would find better gold, more gold ect. It was just luck that I found any gold at all! Luck you see! Had you been digging where I tell you then finding all the gold in the world would be a synch! "Whats that?" they cry! "Why don't I get a shovel and start digging?" they scoff! "Because that kind of work is below me and I know it! Thats why I'm unlucky, I didn't get the gold I deserved! Thats why you are lucky, because you didn't earn the gold you dug up with luck!"     Luck is a lie the lazy and willfully ignorant tell themselves about the hardworking. [end]
[start] Bet that ex is sorry now lol.  But congrats! Happy for you! [end]
[start] Go and spoil yourself. You deserve it. [end]
[start] troll the old girlfriend on facebook and send her a screenshot of the W-2.   DO IT!.   gratz dude. [end]
[TITLE] Today, I woke up earlier than my man, got up, took a shower, made some hot tea and sat in bed reading while he slept. This is what I always imagined life would be like. [TITLE]
[start] So beautiful! Those are my favorite moments :) [end]
[start] I love this, and I love this for you!  You drew a picture in my head and gave me a feeling in my heart.  I can relate to this feeling. You’ve gone from feeling stressed and out of control to at peace and making moves that are good for you.  Work will be work. Those who get stressed are probably the best of workers because you care. Do your best, and feel confident in your work. You’re probably faced with circumstances you can’t change but you can change how you take care of yourself when you experience this and brings you stress. You can change your attitude to help perceive this circumstances to be lighter. You can work with it, and you can do it. I’m so proud of you for starting the day by getting up earlier, showering, making your lil’ tea, and feeding your brain with a book while you have your man laid beside you. You deserve that, and you deserve that feeling of peace and worth all the time.  I wish you the best, and am sending much love 💛 [end]
[start] I'm not crying, *you're* crying. [end]
[start] Please write a book. A biography, a novel. Anything. Write. [end]
[start] Gotta find your own peace. I wake up early on the weekends. Take care of the dogs drink some coffee on the porch. I use it as a time to reflect on everything I have and how far I’ve come. [end]
[start] It's the little things. I'm going to have a nice hot bubble bath soon. Inspired by this post 😘 [end]
[start] This is exactly the same thing I went through about 2 months ago now. Sadly, I went through with my attempt but failed. But I'm so glad I did. I've met someone and we recently spent the night together.   His parents were dancing in the living room, as we ate dinner. My man insisted we listen to Carly Rae Jepsen, and when his parents went out for a smoke, we turned it on and started to dance together. Just out of the blue, played a few songs and just danced for what felt like hours. We took the party outside and just danced like total goofballs.   It was the most comfortable I have felt with anyone. I felt at peace. I wanted to dance with him forever.   Thank you for sharing such a personal part of you, I'm glad you have found peace in these little moments of life :) [end]
[start] I’m happy for you. I read a comment once about a guy being insecure about his age and having to wear glasses. I HAD to comment because I’m in my later 40’s and the man I was dating (for 4 years at the time) wore reading glasses. He was an early riser and a contractor who was the caretaker of a mansion on the river so huge room with sitting area. I would wake up to see him sitting there, doing his crossword and drinking drinking his coffee. As I stirred awake, he would tilt his head and look over the top of his reading glasses at me and say “good morning”. In these moments, he was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. These moments matter and I’m happy you got to experience that. My relationship did not last for various reasons but it was beautiful while we had it. My hope for you is continued happiness. [end]
[start] Username does *not* check out 😉 [end]
[start] Thank you for this post. Now tell the ninjas in my room they can feel free to stop cutting onions [end]
[start] This is so cute, I’m truly & genuinely happy for you and I hope you continue to feel this way forever!❤️ [end]
[start] I've felt the same before and you're right, it's the most wonderful feeling. My boyfriend (of 4 months at that point) had fallen asleep on my chest as I lay in bed reading  in a hotel room after Thanksgiving and I remember looking down at him and just having this calmness and peacefulness in the following feeling. I was in the midst of a remembrance of sorts and had this feeling of looking at a memory of my husband when we were younger and first dating and him asleep on me, as if I were in the future. Been close to hear a few times before but have never felt this sense of certainty and happiness about marrying a man with the others no matter how much I loved them. [end]
[start] I swear to god, I literally just had this feeling just now. As I type this, it's about 10:30pm on Monday night, my girlfriend and I are both laying on the bed with our dog. We're each doing our own thing, but we're still very much together on the same level. I have my noise cancelling headphones on listening to some music, and she's on her computer. I feel warm inside [end]
[start] Thank you for posting this!  You made my day. [end]
[start] It’s the small things like this that really make life worth it. So happy you pushed past the darkness and made it to this side 😊 [end]
[start] I’m so happy that you’re happy. As a person going through a rough patch in life, it’s nice to know there are people that feel how you’re feeling it kinda reminds me that everything will be okay😊 [end]
[start] Go OP! I am so glad you didn’t choose to end your life and to continue living. I hope you continue to enjoy life like this every single day :) [end]
[start] Similar feeling, me(24m) and my girlfriend(30f) watching tv or netflix. Sometimes i will lay my head on her stomach And when i do, she always rubs my back or plays with my hair. In those moments, it is so easy to forget everything. Because the only important thing, is right next to me. [end]
[start] Its the little things that make us feel big! [end]
[start] I'm glad you are happy, but please talk to a mental health professional if you haven't.  Don't put it off just cause you're happy right now.  You don't want to wait until another bad spell comes and then do it. [end]
[start] Yes, men are great. Everyone should own a couple of them... [end]
[start] Having a serious headache and I cannot do anything even reading some serious news, but I managed finishing reading this post and it almost made me cry... [end]
[start] Oh my god, I'm crying. I'm glad you found peace from a crazy life. I wish you the best ❤ [end]
[start] This is beautiful.   Keep your chin up, it always gets better. [end]
[start] I love when my partner wakes up before me and I can listen to her softly going about her morning. [end]
[start] I'm so happy that you could find some peace. I have definitely been in a dark place before where things seem hopeless. I spent about 5 years of my life in this place. Eventually I also found some peace and I am now dating my future wife. I really wish you the best and hope you post about your engagement in the future. Hugs. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry you needed to, but so happy you used the hotline, and are here today. Also incredibly happy for the peace you found this morning! I hope you can hold onto those moments when life gets stressful again. It’s those little things that keep us going. [end]
[start] That’s so wonderful!!! I hope to feel that way some day ❤️ enjoy your week! [end]
[start] Heh heh, I am waiting for this moment to come. Prob will after I finish all my schooling. [end]
[start] I had a shit day but my guy was there for me the whole way and reading this made me cry.  I am so happy for you both. He is lucky to have someone who appreciates him so much. [end]
[start] STOP CUTTING DAMN ONIONS! [end]
[start] One day I want this too. Kudos to you OP for appreciating moments like these [end]
[start] Congratulations on your newfound serenity before launching out again. [end]
[start] One day I hope to feel the same as you did in that moment. [end]
[start] Am I allowed to be jealous? [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Go you!! [end]
[start] THIS.   I love it when I'm tired and I'm taking nap on my boyfriend's chest while he's just playing on the playstation or watching something on the TV [end]
[start] This morning I had to tell my mum to prepare herself because I am going to die soon because I'm going to have to kill myself. This is not what I always imagined life would be like.  Nice that it worked out for you, though. [end]
[start] Some people don’t realize how difficult it is to have that moment of peace and gratitude after a severe period of depression. When you’re in that valley, you don’t believe you’ll experience it again. I am really happy that you found that moment and I hope you experience more of them soon. [end]
[start] i’m really happy for you!  not got much else to say, but just to see someone else manage to achieve something i’ve kinda dreamed about gives me some hope, along with making me feel happy that atleast one other person is. <3 [end]
[start] I have kids. And I kinda hate you a little bit.   But at the same time, really happy for you. I miss those moments. [end]
[start] I used to have this - I'm an early riser so I would always wake up before my girlfriend. It's the most at home I ever felt since I was young. [end]
[start] A really nice moment. I am glad you experienced that :) I hope you told him how you felt at that moment - might help him to make you happy! [end]
[start] Most wholesome thing I’ve read on the internet today ❤️ [end]
[start] You deserve it. I'm so happy to read things like this. 3 years ago, came from a bad relationship, talking to myself in the front of the mirror crying to now waking next to my husband to be. Life is so good. [end]
[start] So beautiful, can completely relate. After being suicidal for so long finding someone who truly makes you feel happy and ‘right’ is such a pure feeling. Glad you were here to feel this moment [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] This makes me so happy to hear. Happy for you :) [end]
[start] But here’s the thing.. even if you get into a situation where he no longer is the thing that makes you have these thoughts ( you get into a fight, you break up, whatever), these experiences are always out there. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but there will always be this random moment in time that makes you happy. Even if for a moment. These moments add up to happiness and they are worth sticking around for.  I’m glad that you fought to have this moment. Stick it in your memory bank for when you think you’ll never have another. And good luck with your love, in hopes you never have to have this as only a memory. ❤️ [end]
[start] That feeling of peace and "home" when I look at a partner, that is how I know it's real love. I'm so glad you have that. ❤️ [end]
[start] Dont mess it up by getting married [end]
[start] I wish I could feel this, often times I feel depressed even in relationships [end]
[start] It so lovely and encouraging to know that some people do find happiness in this world. These are the moments that mean the most. [end]
[start] My wife and I have been together since 1998 when I was 16 and she was 20 ours is a long story  but let's just say we found In eachother that missing other half of our souls together we were bestfriends in love we had a daughter in 2000 got married in 2001 and had our son in 2003 now its 20 years later and being together is all we know but the spark is gone it's just routine now no passion and I want it back we made it through so much to get here today her being engaged to another dude who was 24 (I was 16) to pregnancy (@17 and 21) to addiction to me going from a pill addiction we shared to a heroin addiction that almost destroyed everything which is what usually happens when someone injects themselves daily with heroin and meth for 10+ years then there was jail and treatment programs and jail again and then inpatient and jail again I was book into the county jail 19 times in 5 years and now I've been off hard drugs and needles for 2.5 years and haven't been locked up in almost 3 years I moved my wife and kids Dylan my daughter 19 and Olen my son 16 out o fa my parents house where we had to live after losing everything including the house I bought when I was 22 now we are renting a nice new beautiful place of our own work is good kids are happy and I fell in love with a breed of dogs called American bullies (Google it if you arnt familiar) which have been the best source  for joy in my post heroin eccsistance but she mt wife mara just drifts farther away and nothing is working to reel her in I don't think she will meet me halfway but I'm cool with going all the way myself I just wan my bestfriend and lover back I have no interest in finding another woman to find what I missing I want her I know the past has past and wont ever return not just the way things once were but maybe reminiscent of what was but new and fresh herandi2.0 what should I do to get her to fall I love all over with me tho [end]
[start] Fantastic, I woke up earlier than my girlfriend this morning and finished a book myself. Nothing like starting out the day in a productive way. Enjoy those moments once you live together they'll just get better and better [end]
[start] So wholesome [end]
[start] life would be worth living if I wasnt forever alone [end]
[start] I’m so incredibly jealous [end]
[start] 😬 really hope he doesn’t break up with you. Sounds like you have a lot of your happiness and self worth tied to him.   But otherwise, hooray! Appreciating those lovely, soft moments is what it’s all about!! [end]
[start] I’m glad to hear you feel better and found someone you love so much but please work on yourself. Your happiness should not depend on someone else. To go from suicidal to feeling peace all because of someone else other than yourself is a bit extreme. I wish you find true happiness within yourself. [end]
[start] I can't believe Reddit eats this stuff up [end]
[start] [Redacted] [end]
[start] Being a guy, he is happy you let him sleep. We like to wake up when we wake up unless there are fun times involved. I will also wake up to that. [end]
[start] Do you ever make cold tea for the same purpose? [end]
[start] That's really sweet. Thanks for writing this. [end]
[start] Who gives a fuck? [end]
[start] Sounds boring af [end]
[TITLE] After COVID, we need to normalize wearing masks when we are suffering from cold/flu. [TITLE]
[start] Ideally people should simply stay home. However, if they have no choice, then I fully agree that this is a great idea. Not to mention that hand sanitizers should still be available everywhere. [end]
[start] Theyve been doing this for years in some Asian countries. [end]
[start] After COVID, you likely won't ever see a mask again.  Judging from the way *some* people act about them now. [end]
[start] I worked in a dental office pre-pandemic and I had become accustomed to wearing a mask for work. I remember one day I decided to take some masks home because it was flu season and I had to take public transport. The looks I got for wearing a mask was that of disgust and anger. I remember feeling so uncomfortable by other people. Crazy social conditioning! I really hope mask wearing sticks around. [end]
[start] We need to normalize not leaving home when you have a temporary contagious disease. Starts with better workplace protections, but hey, here in the US, we have the freedom to get fucked by everyone. [end]
[start] Good idea, but have fun getting people on board with that one. [end]
[start] I don’t know about where you live but it’s pretty normal in many Asian countries [end]
[start] How. Dare. You.   It is my right as a [insert whatever] to not be forced to breathe through a mask. Besides, germs can just go around man!!! What are you, a *democrat liberal socialists libtard?!?!?*  Sadly, the above is about what we can expect from millions of adults.   Yes, people, take precautions. Our great grand parents knew this stuff but we never had to. We need to learn it again. And fast. [end]
[start] I attempted to stay home years ago when I had a horrible flu. Boss threatened me into coming in anyway where I worked as a grocery bagger. It took one of my coworkers pulling a manager over and advocating for me to go home before they let me leave. Half the staff was sick a week later and I saw in newspapers that the flu had started spreading in the middle of summer.  I later found out one of my supervisors accused me of faking being sick after I left. The U.S doesn't give two shits if you're sick and contagious. They want your ass at work and if you don't go, you're fired at worst and lose out on essential pay at best. [end]
[start] Yes. Also, quit shaking hands and invading peoples space. [end]
[start] Or just normalizing not going out when you're sick [end]
[start] I agree, I’m hoping even when a vaccine is released that people wise up and take more precautions, and enough normalizing working with a flu! [end]
[start] Tell it to /r/Coronaviruscirclejerk [end]
[start] I wore a medical face mask to school ten years ago when I thought I was sick and my science teacher made me take it off... bet he feels dumb now. [end]
[start] We should also normalize not smoking. Yes Susan, we don't want to inhale the smoke that could in a long run kill us. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] God I hope this is the case. I've never been so healthy. I felt like I spent most of the year catching people's colds, but now I haven't been sick once. Fuck you and your germs, Karen! [end]
[start] I was actually watching a show about doctors (sort of like housewives but doctors) and one of the spouses had a cold and was wearing a mask at home to protect his family. I was like why isn’t this common knowledge?? [end]
[start] You’re right, but you fucking know we’re not going to. [end]
[start] Seriously. I haven't gotten sick once this year. I usually get a sore throat/cold about once every few months. But all these precautions we have been taking has slowed the spread of more common and mundane illnesses as well and I kind of like that. [end]
[start] Looking back I’m surprised this wasn’t already the norm [end]
[start] the first thing We should normalize is staying home when you are sick [end]
[start] OP said normalize, not mandate.  Normalize as in Japan.  To OP, common courtesy is not normalized here so I doubt you will see people wearing mask when sick.  In the same, you would have people looking down on those that do.  But 10-15years post covid, I would hope that those that want to, do not get viewed any differently than they would in Japan. [end]
[start] Hey or just stay home, maybe thats an easier solution that we've already been using. [end]
[start] Gotta be honest; once this is over, I never want to wear a mask again.  I have no objections to them now. Until a vaccine comes, they are our best reasonable way to combat covid and everyone should properly wear them in public.  Once this is over? No thanks, never again. I'll wear them now but they suck. I'd rather take my chances with cold. I get flu vaccines anyway, so if it's a choice between anyone who has a cold has to wear one, or take my chances? I'll take my chances.  Most people who are infectious with a cold are asymptomatic at first anyway, so would it make a big difference if they only wore them while they're sick? We wear masks now because we don't know who might have it. If you're sick, stay home. Like w/ covid. [end]
[start] I have been much healthier this year thanks to masks and not having to pick the grandkids up from school. Usually I get every single cold going around. This year I been strong and not sick all year. So. Yay for Covid? [end]
[start] COVID-19 is not going away any time soon, if at all, at least not during an administration  that's pretending it doesn't exist. [end]
[start] God yeah. They do it in Japan all the time. Be like Japan! [end]
[start] fuck off [end]
[start] Nobody will listen anyways there's so many stubern assholes who don't wear masks in public now do you really think they will listen then? People don't care most people don't listen because majority thinks THERE always right [end]
[start] I work in an environment with a ton of kids and I’ve noticed that ever since the pandemic, with all the sanitizing and mask-wearing, I haven’t gotten sick, not even a cold! It is pretty nice! [end]
[start] it unfortunately won’t happen. people are already lifting in gyms without masks, for example. [end]
[start] To be fair I don't think I've ever seen someone sick out shopping or doing something essential. There should be less of a stigma around taking days off /sick days. I personally have gone into work on a Monday and Friday when I'm not feeling great just because people would give me shit for it later. It's not always outright saying it but just those off handed comments trying to pass off as jokes like "how was the long weekend haha". [end]
[start] Wearing masks in public places, even if you’re not sick, will surely become the norm.  Just imagine what concerts and sporting events will look like - a year ago if you wore a medical mask to one of these you would have gotten some strange looks.  A year from now, you’ll get strange looks if you’re not wearing one. [end]
[start] pretty sure it is normalized everywhere except north america/ USA [end]
[start] I would do this at my previous job, they told me to take it off or go home due to optics to our customers. I took my mask off and sneezed next to him in his office, didn't cover my mouth, didn't attempt to excuse myself. I looked at him and told him I can't afford to go home. [end]
[start] After?  What an optimist. [end]
[start] I've been thinking exactly this. We need to normalize masks even after covid. It helps not only with covid but with every other contagious illness from spreading. [end]
[start] I think hygiene has been and will be focused on more now that we were hit with covid [end]
[start] I do wish a immunoligist would chime in. Weakened immune system, then you do catch a cold and it kills you. Everyone will be surprised but they really shouldn't be... [end]
[start] Idk... Isn't herd immunity to things like the cold a good thing in the long run? [end]
[start] In japan you are supposed to stay home if you are sick or if you have to leave wear a mask [end]
[start] Hahahahahaha. “After COVID” [end]
[start] Normalize staying home.   In japan people are apparently too proud or unable to so that's why they did this with masks. I don't think some people are going to be using them properly either so that can create even more problems [end]
[start] Yes, please.  Look at at countries like Japan as a model of what could be normal many places after Covid-19.  Unless you're just so selfish that you don't care if you potentially pass the flu to an elderly person who could die of it, why wouldn't you wear a mask if you're potentially contagious (feeling under the weather) but need to go out?  If lives can be saved and public health outcomes can be improved by a trend towards normalizing and encouraging mask usage when appropriate, that would be one nice thing to come out of Covid-19. [end]
[start] Sometimes you can't stay home if you're sick. [end]
[start] I wish i'd worn masks sooner. I'm pretty ugly as it is and wearing a mask help with a little confidence building. [end]
[start] I agree completely. But after seeing the pushback from people claiming “civil rights” I can see how this won’t happen. Because people are idiots. [end]
[start] I live in japan and I agree. Like normalize masks. I wear them everytime I fly and when I went back to the US for the first time to visit family people kept looking at me like I’m crazy (like 5 years ago) like I’m sorry I don’t wanna be stuck on a plane with recycled air with all you nasty people. [end]
[start] I hope so. [end]
[start] Yeah, that's great. But during a global pandemic people are protesting the use. So how are we gonna get all the Karens do go along during a regular flu? [end]
[start] Well we(at least where I live) did that before this so no worries. We’ll do it after this too. [end]
[start] Masks are good for allergies too [end]
[start] If you're healthy enough to fight it off, it can be a good thing for your immune system to be exposed to different assailants from time to time. For that reason, getting sick less often can actually be detrimental. The more unique invaders your immune system is exposed to, the more reactive it is when responding to similar invasions on subsequent exposure.  I'm not sure whether we'd see more benefit as a society from normalizing mask wearing or from the herd immunity we get from regular exposure to bacteria and viruses. Wearing masks more often may reduce infection rate, but worsen the infections that result when we do catch something. [end]
[start] I'll be wearing a mask in public for the rest of my life.  The prospect of defeating facial recognition pleases me. [end]
[start] Oh yah  When the covid first started earlier this year, I walked on the street wearing a mask, people looked at me like I was a freak. 🤷‍♂️ [end]
[start] Im all pro masks and evrything but my head hurts after a day of wearing one idk how doctors do it [end]
[start] I brought this up during a conversation a couple weeks ago, just like Korea or China we should wear masks even after covid ends. Ideally, it's best to stay home when you're sick but if it's mandatory for you to leave the house, we should wear masks then. [end]
[start] Actually, I would agree with that. Where I'm from, this is actually normalized in our society and community for a long time. People should simply stay at home if they don't feel well or if they have to go to work or go out, wear a mask not to infect others. Personally, I don't understand why this isn't the same case in western countries since this is basic health hygiene but I don't know, I maybe biased. [end]
[start] This! I work at a music school and an after school care and the amount of kids coming in with coughs and runny noses (even during covid when restrictions were relaxed enough for us to reopen) is ridiculous! I understand you’ve paid for the lesson but please, cold and flus spread like wildfire in school, keep your kids at home. [end]
[start] Im wearing it cuz im ugly as shit but i support the message. [end]
[start] This is my dream. [end]
[start] There’s other things that I would like normalised too. In the gym there are hand sanitising stations and anti bacterial sprays to use on equipment before and after use. This should have been happening way before covid. [end]
[start] We can’t even get people to wear them now though :( [end]
[start] This would be great [end]
[start] Absolutely. It’s something I’ve done for about 4 years and I’m always baffled by anyone that turns up to my place of work (my house) expecting a close contact service while sneezing into the air. Dirty bastards. A tiny cold to anyone else can put me off work for months at a time because of my immune system. I even say it and say if they are sick we reschedule for free, no fee. And to please protect me.  Nope, nobody has ever given a shit. [end]
[start] I was thinking the same yup [end]
[start] It’s such a weird thing. My cousin in the last three months went to bars and clubs in places like Texas, Florida, and Colorado, yet seems like he’s in good health. There’s no question that the virus is contagious, but I believe it’s only threatening to those with health problems, pre-existing conditions, or who are of older age. When it comes to younger kids, teens, and adults I’ll say we have a lesser probability of dying from it. Although we may catch the virus we wouldn’t be so awfully sick or have extreme symptoms. Wearing masks I believe is effective in crowded areas such as going to the grocery store, but when it comes to being outdoors or working out at the gym it becomes useless. [end]
[start] My name is Karen and fuuuuuuuuuu...ing hell naaaaaaa [end]
[start] I would agree, and I would tell people that we haven't been taking flu season as seriously as we should when they talked about how we don't do all of this for the flu. [end]
[start] So. Japan. [end]
[start] Nah I’m good [end]
[start] I saw a video of a public pool.....we really did that [end]
[start] No. You’ll lower your immune system. [end]
[start] how about we not do that [end]
[start] How about no. [end]
[start] Stay home and leave us normal people alone [end]
[start] Japan does it, it’s not really an issue unless you’re doing heavy exercise, people are babies tho “it’s infringing upon my rights, wahhhhh” [end]
[start] We can normalize it but it shouldn’t be a law [end]
[start] I completely agree with this and plan on wearing masks when we go out sick. [end]
[start] Did you have to stick something down your throat? I've been with a few woman that complained of soar throats after a night of fun. [end]
[start] People eventually aren't going to have immune systems! What happened to encouraging children to play in the dirt?  Five years from now, researchers will probably say that exposure to large quantities of disinfectant and hand sanitizers can cause cancer. [end]
[start] The stigma of wearing a mask is over...   and I am glad that is case now.  Hopefully it remains so. [end]
[start] This is actually disgusting to think about, it’s like no one paid attention in middle school, germs are good for you, it helps your immune system. If you avoid germs at all costs, you’re more likely to catch tuberculosis and other seriously life threatening diseases.. so please do us a favor and stfu [end]
[start] I’m salty because someone’s smole daughter spat at me in the grocery store the first week of Texas lockdown. I understand it can be uncomfortable and hard for children to wear masks, but I hope it gets normalized to wear one for everyone [end]
[start] The problem with Americans in general before covid is that my American colleagues who were visibly sick (common cold symptons) still came to work and treated it like this is nothing. I am from South Korea originally and work in Finance in NY and was shocked by this. Amercans simply don’t have a good hygienic manner and aren’t bothered by the fact they could’ve spread gems to ppl around them. Common cold spreads the same way as covid just a matter of contagiousness. sorry to say this [end]
[start] If you have the flu, you should be staying home for 6 days. If you have a cold, you should be staying home for 3. If you have COVID-19, make it 3 weeks. That’s the way I see it. [end]
[start] You really think you can get trump voters to do this? [end]
[start] No [end]
[start] No. [end]
[start] No we fucking don’t [end]
[start] how about no [end]
[start] Uhm, no! How do you think we develop immunity? Perhaps you need to be inoculated from the news media! [end]
[start] No we fucking do not. Do you realise how much damage not being able to see people’s faces is doing to us? Do you see how they decrease empathy between strangers? Do you see how they reduce societal cohesion? Do you see how they they frighten children?   Do you see how some people have had the most awful time of their lives this year, and every mask they see is a stinging reminder of that? Do you know how high the suicide rate is right now? No? Probably best to not think about it right?  Do you see how they make us more vulnerable to future viruses by reducing our bacteria intake and weakening our immune system?   I just want someone to fucking see this from another point of view. We’re still capable of that right? Considering other views? [end]
[start] Doggo was gonna do this anyways whether he was told to or not cause he doesn't want to be told to do.   Cause doggo like how masks at stores look on his face but all he got now is a monkey smile one instead, that makes him look like the joker. Its dumb cause he want other masks from japan instead.  Cause doggo also don't want to be told to get vaccine cause his mom was antivaxer but not him.   I beleive my mom doesn't like trump like my sister cause they don't like politics much like me and dad.  My sister may be a liberal cause she seems more in that range over the idea of a lack of respected rules.  Woof. This is why doggo has aspergers bro, atleast according to mom, cause I think I got it from dad.  Dad's a conservative who wants freedom and is paranoid about the left, but I think I can't really tell.  So Doggo think that instead he will sit and wear mask cause the rest is familially confusing I guess.  My mom gave me the monkey mask, she got it from my dads non-genetic brother's girlfriend, or mom.   I'm not into political rules on what should be mandatory past the basics of theft, fraud and murder. Or organizational restraints for success of beaurocratic system necessity by need for freedom.  As a free country doesn't enforce a saved life merely provides an available option for the people who are free to decide on whether it is worth living for. Since the other actually can be of far less comfort for it.  But this only evidently applies to current situation. If people are gonna buy toilet paper instead of food...  Then that's what seemed more important, because giving everyone food for it is a price to the cure.   Since it soends money on the wrong part of the solution that would inhibit the priority over choice. [end]
[start] lol wut [end]
[start] We should normalize wearing a mask in general, especially during cold and flu season, sick AND healthy.  If only the sick wear a mask, then they'll be ostracized. Who knows why they're out and about, if they have no choice, or what, but they'll get dirty looks or worse for it. They'll be less likely to wear one because they don't want to be picked out for it. Best if everyone wears a mask. [end]
[start] no. [end]
[start] Gotta do something like this. Lord knows there are way too many people that won’t vaccinate to get rid of COVID-19. Could comment on those people but why... [end]
[start] Yes. [end]
[start] No [end]
[start] Another option would be detection of infection in the air with the rest as it implies area contains infection. Implimented with the rest of them like a smoke alarm of sorts for diseases in areas measured. [end]
[start] The signs of wearing a mask is gone.  Hopefully it remains so [end]
[start] Good luck. [end]
[start] So you want to intentionally weaken our collective immune systems- immunity only works when you use is (c.f. last 600 years of first contact with indigenous peoples) [end]
[start] I get that wearing masks is neccesary in a pandemic but i refuse to "normalize" rules as 1.5 meters distance and wearing a mask for a simple cold. People who are afraid of catching should wear it if they really wanna dont wanna catch it But i am not putting on a mask for just a cold after this has all gone. I get a cold can mean the end for some but unfortunetly for them the entire world isnt gonna bend for them. The same goes for 1.5 meters. Its not really a problem but i just prefer not to do it when i dont have to wich is what ill do after this is al over. [end]
[start] What makes you think there will be an “after covid” [end]
[start] Noted. [end]
[start] No, we don't. If we eliminate infections our immune system deteriorates in it's effectiveness. This would leave us open to all sorts of other ugly stuff. [end]
[start] Yes [end]
[start] No, how about we normalize sick people and vulnerable people just staying home like we did for all of recorded history prior to 2020... [end]
[start] Hell no [end]
[start] So it took a mild virus that behaves like the flu plus crazy media for you guys to realize this? I’ve been saying this for years! [end]
[start] I think it would be best to always somewhat stick to wearing masks and not being too close to strangers. Even if not COVID or flu, you never know what kind of sicknesses other people may have. [end]
[start] If masks did anything I would agree with you. [end]
[start] Yes please [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[TITLE] My mom rage quit her job yesterday and it was honestly inspiring [TITLE]
[start] She’s my damn hero. Good for her. [end]
[start] Also she can likely file for unemployment due to untenable working conditions because she has the messages. [end]
[start] Your mom could probably make a nice bit of money offering online one on one lessons to parents with kids who are behind and trying to catch up. Zoom and other virtual live sessions make live lessons possible, as well as any kind of virtual payments like PayPal, venmo, zelle, etc. [end]
[start] As a 55-year-old I'm concerned about pension ramifications.  Where I live the teacher pension plan is a billion-dollar outfit with a wide range of investments.  Our teacher pensions are not only very secure but all in all quite generous.  Add to that good incomes, solid benefits, and all the perqs you could want.  But with your mom being 60 it's unlikely that she'll find another job unless she's so good that an employer builds a position around her after hiring her.  Workers her age just don't get hired without a lot of prestige and renown in their professions.  Which makes me wonder what she'll do for retirement income.  But I admit that it's none of my business and fully agree that at 60 she has the right to enjoy what's left of her life expectancy.  All the best. [end]
[start] My mom was the director of a preschool for 15 years and also rage quit... sort of. She gave them until the end of the school year (2 months) to find her replacement. She was so angry and stressed. She tried to update policies and implement small, positive changes to keep the school current with best practices. The teachers were gossipy, petty, and completely unwilling to cooperate. My mom is the kindest person and I felt so bad about everything they put her through. [end]
[start] I worked in a preschool/daycare for a total of two months before I said nope and bounced. For whatever reason they seem to be the most drama filled schools. Good on her for getting out of that toxic ass environment. [end]
[start] Good for her. [end]
[start] Yesssss. The people are rising up. ✊🏻 [end]
[start] Honestly, good for your mum. There's nothing better than rage quitting a job. I was a waitress in a tapas bar/restaurant after uni, and they treated me like absolute shit. I got my first proper 'grownup job' with a contract, then rang them from the pub to say I quit and never went back, except as a customer lol.  I thought I was badass for doing that. Your mum is awesome. It's a shame such an illustrious career ended that way, but she stood up for herself. I'm glad you're parents are a solid unit who support each other through thick and thin - marriage goals! [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing this. I am currently at my breaking point as well with my job. Weeks get busy and I understand that. However, due to this COVID19, I have finally opened my eyes and really understood how I’m being treated at my own job.   My time is not valued. Things get planned and IM EXPECTED to do them on top of everything else I have to do. I am the only person on my team (we have alternating weeks at our facility to reduce the amount of people exposed). I stood up last week and said, “I’m sorry I’m not able to help since I have (x, y and z) to do today.” To say the least, my co-worker was NOT happy about it and was upset at me  I went to my manager (on the other team) and messaged her explaining the situations. We have protocols due to COVID (I have to prep for tastings and generally I would serve— this time I’m NOT allowed to); with my team it’s not sticking. I’m still expected to serve and even with myself wearing a mask and gloves it still makes me very uncomfortable doing it (I’m high risk and my mom is higher risk). She said she’ll remind everyone, but I honestly don’t know if that will be enough.   I honestly have no idea where I am going with this— other than that I understand your mom completely and I don’t blame her. I’m proud of her for taking a stance and saying, “no!” Mental health comes first! [end]
[start] I’m right behind your mom on this same topic.  Been a preschool teacher for 11 years.  New leadership came in three years ago and the program has changed so much, a lot of good teachers are leaving.  I just had an interview somewhere else and praying I can jump ship too. It’s hard to let go of something you love.  I’m proud your mom has no regrets. [end]
[start] Cool read...and as long as your still living with two feet and a heart beat you can still take up hobbies and even still do things to earn income....just with less stress. [end]
[start] Preschools are infact festering drama piles, you wouldn't believe the lengths of pettiness primary school employees go to to make each others life miserable, and that's not even mentioning the chit chat behind your back [end]
[start] You’re mother is inspiring me too [end]
[start] She’s a hero! With her dedication, I’m sure she’ll find a job that’s worthy of her [end]
[start] She can start a YouTube channel going over different learning exercises/classes/subjects that she’s used to doing and teaching young minds. She has such high accolades for herself it’ll be amazing and fun! [end]
[start] From the European point of view it's unthinkable for me that a 60-year old woman isn't entitled to any kind of pension in her age and she cannot just retire and don't give a fuck any more... I wish all the luck to your parents, good luck with the piano lessons! [end]
[start] Wow! Sounds like a huge weight lifted off her shoulders. I'm so happy for her! [end]
[start] I hope a good school out there finds this deserving teacher.  When and if your mom is ready to go back to work, she is needed.  We need good teachers. [end]
[start] My mom was a preschool teacher for about 15 or so years. Can confirm how much drama happens behind the scenes every damn day lmao. Good for your mom tho! My mom did the same thing last year (from a nonprofit that managed First 5 in preschools) but it was the same shit - manager/exec has favorites that wreck havoc on other employees with no recourse and who can basically shun people they don’t like until they quit or are fired. She was already moving in with my brother and his family temporarily and was teaching college courses on the side so she said fuck it and quit. As she said “I’m too old and too qualified to deal with that shit”. (She’s 59 lol) [end]
[start] I commend her! She did something I couldn’t do. Co-teachers can be just as bad as that one kid in the group project who did NOTHING and made the presentation worse by speaking. Yay! Less stress! [end]
[start] I think the teachers don't get paid well enough for all the shit they deal with. She did what I would have done ... good on her [end]
[start] your mom is only 3 years from eligible for social security. is she going to get a job or just retire? [end]
[start] 👍👍👍 [end]
[start] I work in a daycare) all women. And honestly there’s a lot of drama. [end]
[start] I’m so proud of your mom!!! [end]
[start] Fucking boss of her to do that. Don't tell her I said a bad word. [end]
[start] I quit my job today. Similar story - just couldn’t take the crap one minute more. It was totally worth it. It’s really cool that you have her back - just like my family. They would rather I was happy again. Best of luck to your mum in her search for a new job. [end]
[start] Great story and props to your mama! But ... PRESCHOOL CODING CLASS!? Wowza [end]
[start] This happened to my mom too.  Different situation, but she worked at her job in HR for about 3 years I guess, managing handfuls of stores on her own and was fucking miserable. People called her at all hours of the day, on weekends when she was supposed to be off, she dealt with countless people just treating her like shit. It got so bad at one point, her heart rate escalated to high because of stress that we had to take her to the hospital, thinking she was having a heart attack.   She went to a conference for the company and a male higher up basically spoke down to her and that was the straw that broke it all. She was fired for not complying with his unattainable and unreasonable expectations. She cried when she called to tell me about it, as my dad is disabled and shes the bread winner of our family. I told her I was proud of her.  Shes currently in a court case against them for discrimination. They gaslighted her for being a woman and for having mental health problems. Send good vibes. [end]
[start] What a beast. Moms are awesome! [end]
[start] Good on your mom for leaving that toxic environment. I'm also a preschool teacher and it's no surprise that there's drama amongst teachers in a preschool. [end]
[start] I hope your Mom has the chance to enjoy being a part of the new administration in 18 months from now [end]
[start] Good for her! [end]
[start] Your mom is awesome! Hope she feels better :))) [end]
[start] Good for her. [end]
[start] Props to your mom..that other teacher doesn’t deserve a job though. Like how irresponsible is it to forget a lesson plan and then be like “meh I don’t wanna do this week either, you do it” like HELL NO. Good job for your mom and I hope she’s able to get another job if she wants one!!! [end]
[start] She now has the opportunity to try something new!  I'm happy for her. Money can't undo misery. [end]
[start] Good on her! I did the same thing just when coronavirus was really starting up. It was clear management didn’t care about lower employees and when my boss was getting a temper at me for things I didn’t do and had no control over again, I told her I quit and she can handle it and left [end]
[start] Your mom is a Queen [end]
[start] Go mom!! 🥳 [end]
[start] It’s a shame education has to lose good teachers like your mom over dumb administrative bs like that. Kids are so impressionable and need morally good people to teach them more than just textbook things. I wish your family the best and hope your mom can find new ways and places to continue teaching. [end]
[start] :Sounds like she should have a great resume if she decides to try and teach somewhere else! My mom had it great teaching preschool at a community center because it was the only preschool class there so everyone left her alone to make the decisions and create her own curriculums. [end]
[start] I have so many thoughts and questions!  My wife is a teacher and you are 100% correct on the e-learning.  Teachers stepped up big time to educate kids the best they could.  It wasn't perfect but it was amazing what they managed to do working with parents.  I hope parents appreciate how much effort is required to teach!  Second, a coding class for pre-school? Holy crap.  If they get started that young the matrix is just around the corner.  I can't even imagine how she did that.  Co-teaching seldom works out.  My wife has done it on and off for the last 30 years and I can remember only once that I didn't get to work on my listening skills while she complained about it.    Good for your mom. She now free to retire or work at a district that cares. There is also a possibility that if she has retirement benefits she could go work in another state without effecting those.  We live in Illinois and many teachers retire as soon as they can and go to work in Wisconsin.  After 10 years they double retire.  Good luck to mom!! [end]
[start] I'm happy for your mother. I'm also confident that when she decides she wants to try her hand at teaching again, she will not be short on opportunities. Until then, I wish her a restful time. She's earned it.  I would love to hear an update about what happens next. [end]
[start] A mother to be proud of. [end]
[start] Good for her! You can only be stomped on for so long! [end]
[start] Sometimes it’s just worth the peace of mind, emotional and physical health and ability to spend precious time with your loved ones.  I rage quit one job and it was honestly one of the most empowering things I did to take back my life.   Best of luck to her on her new chapter! [end]
[start] Good for her. That takes guts and she’s very brave [end]
[start] Your mom is bae. [end]
[start] Tell her I’m proud of her it’s a hard thing to do walking out I did it cause I pulled most of the weight at one of my jobs best thing g I ever did [end]
[start] Nothing kills a love of teaching faster than shitty administrators.   Also, literally every school is a dumpster fire behind the scenes. [end]
[start] Sometimes the best way to lean in is to lean the hell out of there. [end]
[start] My mom is an amazing teacher. The shit that they have to put up with from other unprofessional teachers/ administrators is unbelievable. It’s amazing how many teachers just don’t care about the kids and their education. They just turn up for the pay cheque. [end]
[start] As a previous preschool teacher, I feel her pain and that drama is real.  Good for her! [end]
[start] I've rage quit before and it felt great, good on her. [end]
[start] I wish I had the guts to rage quit my job like this. Ive just been stewing after what my boss said when I had to call off work because of medical reasons (I was in so much pain I could barely crawl to the bathroom). First time calling off in the whole year I worked there and even went to urgent care and got a note stating that I do indeed have a medical condition and she says "well you need to get this sorted out, everything is opening up again and we can't afford to have unreliable employees"... I didnt even know what to say to that  Anyways, congrats to your mom for doing what I couldn't bring myself to do [end]
[start] Time to enjoy her life!!! [end]
[start] Tell your mom she can put all her effort into her own preschool business online, shed make a pretty penny and do what she loves as well [end]
[start] "Have you ever worked in an office with other women, who you have negative things to say about?" [end]
[start] Man,  I feel like a weight has lifted off of me now that she quit....whew. [end]
[start] You don't quit your job until you have something else lined up. Sorry that's not the example she's teaching you by. She must have someone supporting her, because most people cannot do what she did. really, people with families should not do something like this. You should think of the long-term consequences it will have on the family. [end]
[start] There's people who have it 1000x harder and they don't even complain. [end]

[start] Happy birthday and have a great day. How did we ever lose the war on poverty though? I think it's the greatest tragedy of mankind. [end]
[start] How awesome. Thank you for sharing happy birthday!! [end]
[start] I could care less about your careerpath advancment.   What has made you happy in life? [end]
[start] Happy birthday! I’m glad I came across this post tonight. Do you have advice for an early 20s person like me just getting life started? I feel so fearful even when I know I shouldn’t be for some things. I’m trying to get sober as well. [end]
[start] Happy birthday 🎂 may you be blessed always [end]
[start] Happy birthday! [end]

[start] Happy birthday! [end]
[start] Sad how the war on poverty because the war on black men followed by other men. Sure it empowered women to have children before marriage and fornicate but it also destroyed the norm of what constitutes a family making it just another definition rather than what helped produced this great country in part... [end]
[start] I, AbRAhAM Aether, Thank You for your short, brief but valuable stories summarized with Love, humility, Humble, Struggles and Peace.   Thank You, Stories around Bond-Fires You’ve brought to My Heart. With Love. [end]

[start] Doo boys!  Happy birthday from another Pennsylvanian who knows how to pronounce it (or mispronounce it?).  Stay safe in the crazy Florida place! [end]
[start] Beautiful post, thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] Congratulation! Well done you. Many, many thanks for your fascinating account - so far!  More to relate no doubt. [end]
[start]  🍻 [end]
[start] thank you for sharing your story.  i'm a teenager and it gave me hope.  tho things aren't awesome right now, I realize i don't need to stress out too much about it.  things will get better if i do good things i guess?  would you like to give this young boy some advice sir? [end]
[start] Best reddit post ever. [end]
[start] I bet you have endless stories of your adventures, post them sometime, would love to read.   Happy Birthday 🎂 And Warm Regards  Your fellow Floridian [end]
[start] Just came to say that you should write a book or a memoir of your time!   I bet you have some stories.   Also the YouTube videos are awesome!   Keep it up Ms Elayne [end]
[start] Happy birthday! It is great to see someone even older them me on Reddit!!! Dad is a little older than you but I don't think we could get him on here.  I have to ask, what is you opinion of journalism now and how does that compare to your time in the field? [end]
[start] Happy birthday! You sound like a nice person [end]
[start] This is a nice post to read as a 23 year old who has no idea what she's doing in life and all i'm good at is art. Happy birthday :) [end]
[start] The fact that you're 82 and can use a keyboard, a mouse, a computer, the internet, and talk to us on Reddit shows that the elderly CAN be taught how to use a computer. So I thank you for proving that it's possible!  &#x200B;  Also, here I have something for you as well [youtube.com/radiodramasonline](https://youtube.com/radiodramasonline) this is my channel. You might love it and remind you of being a child once more. I have a lot of subs and I upload the Twilight Zone, Sherlock Holmes and Superman. A little bit more but you may love it.      I'm not plugging so much as wanting to share this exp with you to make you feel young again [end]
[start] Happy birthday. Reddit has a suprising number of old fucks. [end]

[TITLE] Two years ago today, I was crying in my car working three jobs to somehow pay for my education. Today I was notified I was the recipient of my 12th scholarship totaling nearly a quarter-million dollars dedicated to my degree. [TITLE]
[start] This is awesome. Now kill it in school and do something you love. And make a good living. You are now ahead. Keep widening the gap. Really happy to read this. [end]
[start] That’s awesome! [end]
[start] I'm proud of you too!! [end]
[start] Amazing news, congratulations! [end]
[start] 12th scholarship? Am I the only one that thinks they should be.... well, spread around more? It's great that it'll pay for your education and it's not your fault the system is obviously busted, but more people receiving a smaller cut would be more beneficial overall imo. [end]
[start] congratulations! any recommendations on where/how to apply for scholarships? [end]
[start] Yasss!!!!! [end]
[start] Super proud. Congrats, this is great!!!! 🎉 [end]

[start] As someone who has $100k+ in student debt, I'm proud of you too! [end]
[start] I obviously don’t know you and I’m so proud and happy for this. You’re amazing! [end]
[start] Really happy for you! But there is seriously something wrong with the world when education costs quarter of a million dollars. [end]
[start] Why isn't anyone asking how it is that one would need a quarter of a million dollars to attend school?  Is this all of med school in its entirety or what? [end]
[start] Congratulations a thousand times over- you deserve it all. Enjoy & good for you! Sending all my stranger good vibes to you!! [end]
[start] Wow. That’s so awesome. So proud of you for accomplishing that. Best of luck with everything ❤️ [end]
[start] What a breakthrough. Time to spread those wings. Congratulations! [end]

[start] Whoo hoo! Happy for you, your grind, and your success! Be sure to take a breather and soak it all in! [end]
[start] Congratulations!🎉🎉🎉 [end]
[start] YOU deserve it. That college is lucky to have someone like you attend. I wish you all the best. This is a huge accomplishment 🤗 [end]

[start] You make us all proud, blood be damned! [end]
[start] Congrats OP. You're doing great! [end]
[start] This is so amazing!! You are receiving the good things from all the hardwork you’ve put in. I also read that you want to do research through neuroscience? That is so cool. Congratulations! Go kick ass in life okay! [end]
[start] That’s awesome! Congrats! [end]
[start] I am beyond, BEYOND, proud of you. Shrugging off the thorny mantle of generational trauma. That was dramatic but fuck it. You earned it and you deserve it. [end]
[start] Proud of you, congratulations 🎉💕💕💕 [end]
[start] Your mother would definitely be the proudest women in the world. [end]
[start] Congratulations. You deserve it !! I am proud of you too. [end]
[start] Wow I'm really happy for you! I'm crying a bit right now... [end]
[start] contractions ... uhhh counterstains .... phone... congratulations. There were go. [end]
[start] Hey, congratulations 🎈🎊🍾🎉!  Good luck to you. [end]
[start] Your mom would definitely be proud of you! You’re not my child, but I am so immensely proud of you! You’re a hard worker, you’re proactive, and you follow through. These qualities will serve you so well throughout your life. Way to change your future! [end]
[start] Love it when good things happen to good people! [end]
[start] I’m happy for you. Congratulations! [end]
[start] We’re all super proud of you! [end]
[start] Hard work pays off! You deserve it! Congrats! [end]
[start] Holy shit congrats! [end]
[start] Awesome 👍 and congratulations 🎉 [end]
[start] As a high school student I’m feeling so happy and I’m proud of you. Did you try calling your mama? I think she’ll be super happy. Tell her ! She loves you! [end]
[start] That’s just amazing and I’m so happy for you! [end]
[start] I’m on scholarship too! It truly makes life so much easier, and you have to worry about so much less. Best of luck on your educational journey :) [end]
[start] Generational curses ! Seriously education is a human right and should be free ! Generational and money have nothing to do with education that is a governments duty ! [end]
[start] you don't know how happy reading things like this make me. I'm happy and proud for you, and never give up on your dreams. God always has a plan for you, and patience is key. May you live a long, healthy, and successful life. AMEEN! [end]
[start] It’s great to hear about your hard work starting to pay off!  If you start feeling guilty about your good fortune because of your friends, remember you put in the work. Scholarships are kind of a gamble that the recipient will use it wisely to make their investment worth it.  You’ve shown that you’re a good bet.   Congratulations! [end]
[start] That’s so awesome!!! I can’t stop smiling for you :) [end]
[start] You worked your ass off!! Now reap! 👍 [end]
[start] Mistakenly downvoted, immediately changed.... god how i felt bad for this little missclick!!! [end]
[start] You got 12 scholarships in 2 years? Go you! [end]
[start] Good job, mate! I’m proud of you for overcoming so much! Get those good grades and a degree, and enjoy your new life and a generational first! Cheers! 👊🏻🍻 [end]
[start] Congratulations! I felt proud of you after reading this - you're doing incredibly well! [end]
[start] Congrats and good luck for your study 💪🏻 [end]
[start] Congratulations on your hard work! Your future bright! [end]
[start] Congrats babe! Beyond happy for you:) [end]
[start] woo [end]
[start] Keep in mind the biggest luxury money gives you is time. Remember to build into your plan a period where it’s about today and not the future. [end]
[start] This is unbelievable, I hope you make your country a better place so future students don’t have to pay for education [end]
[start] Congrats! Your hard work and dedication is paying off. Well done! [end]
[start] That’s amazing! If I was your mom, I’d be proud of you! Heck, I don’t even know you and I am proud of you! Way to go!!!! [end]
[start] Feel proud of yourself! You might not want to mention it to others though if you feel they might get jealous. Depends entirely on your relationship with them whether you want to say something or not [end]
[start] i’m so proud this is an incredible achievement !! [end]
[start] That's fantastic! You are awesome! [end]
[start] You are such a sweet person; that makes up for the shit in this world [end]
[start] I'm 39, selling my $45k house(yes that cheap little house) , divorced, one son in other state , no friends , no gf , no work, was an architect and stoped because a family business that broke , I have $2kusd in my bank and $200 in my pocket.... Surviving until selling my house , want a worst panorama?... I'm Mexican [end]
[start] what do yu study and is it undergraduage or graduate? [end]
[start] That's amazing news!!!! Congratulations! I understand coming from generations of financial insecurity as well. I was sponsored for my re-education and paid monthly plus expenses. There is no bigger relief in this world than to be able to take that financial Boulder off your back and breathe easier knowing you can focus wholeheartedly on your education. I am so excited you get to experience that as well. It sounds like you are even smarter than I am so I hope you chase those dreams and go make a name for yourself someday! I'm rooting for you!! 🍻 [end]
[start] Awesome! Good for you... I totally agree. I went to school where I was paid as well. I made my job, school! I studied and read the material before teacher went thru it so I understood what they were saying. If it got boring I would make flash cards in class so I would be ready to study. Did well at beginning so I could lay back at end.  It paid off cause landed a very good job! My GPA helped me get it.  Now I’m thinking about starting a scholarship locally where I live.. for all the kids planing on going to school cause I appreciate those that gave some to me. [end]
[start] That’s amazing! I’m so happy for you! Congrats!!! [end]
[start] Please for God sake don't waste it on a useless degree. Stem, or you're just stealing from another poor person who would have done the world good [end]
[start] No BS or hate I don't wanna be understood in wrong way  But you put yourself in debt to get worthless diploma  When you could easily educate yourself   Considering the most millionaires and billionaires are self educated people  People just don't get it   Degree is worthless  in every possible way   It's there just to make money for state   You go into debt and then work your ass of and give up your life to pay that debt that's how money is made   Regardless is it a bank or a college or university   If you didn't go into debt and just found two jobs,cut unnecessary spending   In 2 or 3 yrs you could have quarter of million in your pocket   I know how money is made  And how the world works [end]
[TITLE] I overheard my dad talking to his girlfriend on the phone [TITLE]
[start] That is the sweetest!! You’ve got a good one right there :) [end]
[start] Wow I was expecting a horrible review of your bell peppers but was very pleasantly surprised!! That’s so sweet of your Dad [end]
[start] Honestly, I read most of this expecting it to be about you discovering your dad was having an affair, so I guess we were both pleasantly surprised. Sounds like he's got a good attitude. [end]
[start] Not gonna lie, when I read the title I thought you were finding out your dad was having an affair. I'm glad I was wrong. Sounds like you have one of the sweetest dads ever! [end]
[start] Awwwwwww [end]
[start] Awww. Sounds like a great dad! [end]
[start] My dad would've said it was disgusting, I hate my parents tbh [end]
[start] Wait did it melt you in a good or bad way? [end]
[start] That’s the best response, that would have melted me too! [end]
[start] Wait did you know your dad had a girlfriend? [end]
[start] Awww. [end]
[start] That made my throat tighten up [end]
[start] Awesome dad! [end]
[start] Very cute 💕 [end]
[start] Plot twist, he heard ya comin' ;) [end]
[start] Go hug your dad. He deserves one! [end]
[start] That's awesome! If you want to learn more, check out /r/cooking for learning more and getting support and tips on how to increase skills. [end]
[start] He LOVES you!!! Smile! [end]
[start] This right here... I’m a dad (1 boy, 2 daughters). Your dad is exactly right. It’s those moments when our kids flip the script (make something for you, buy you lunch, show up with a coffee) that I always cherish. Doesn’t matter what they did, it’s the act of doing. I’m sitting here, drinking my coffee, and you got me all in my emotions. Thanks for sharing. It brightened my day. [end]
[start] Should test it out. Serve him dirt next time. [end]
[start] Dads are the best ❤️ [end]
[start] There would of been a melted girlfriend on the other end of that phone as well. [end]
[start] That would have really hurt my feelings :/ It means I can't actually trust his feedback on things I make. If everything I do is good, the word good becomes meaningless and I might as well ask a brick wall what it thinks of my stuffed bell peppers [end]
[start] This is so sweet! [end]
[start] My dad would have pretended to like it too [end]
[start] I thought it was going in some other direction in the start lol but no kidding, a dads love for his daughter is infinite. [end]
[start] Congrats on it not tasting like dirt!  (I'd be the worst Dad as I can't stand peppers as a standalone dish 😂) [end]
[start] You had us in the first half, not gonna lie [end]
[start] Awe! That’s so sweet. [end]
[start] THAT is a daddy right there! [end]
[start] Parents just like the thought of it. He definitely appreciated you and what you made [end]
[start] That’s so awesome of him. If you need a full proof recipe just let me know. [end]
[start] So sweet! Love it, especially since my own dad passed a year ago, so I love reading sweet dad stories.   I’m also eating a stuffed bell pepper as I type this. 😂 [end]
[start] Best. Dad. Ever. ❤️ That melted my heart. [end]
[start] I need karma to post an important question in another community please help me out so I can post the question tonight. It needs to happen please dont down me lol [end]
[start] I need karma to post an important question in another community please help me out so I can post the question tonight. It needs to happen please dont down me lol [end]
[start] Wtf is this who gives a fuck lol [end]
[TITLE] Reddit, I have a terribly important message that can save lives, can you please help me get it heard? [TITLE]
[start] I hear you. I wish I could be of more direct assistance, but you are heard. I'm sorry this is what is happening. You and your fellow citizens don't deserve this. As Earthlings, we are all in this together, and what is being done to all of you is shameful. [end]
[start] I'm sorry you have to go through the situation you're in. If I could help, I would. I must admit though, I feel quite helpless. If anyone has an idea, beyond spreading the word, I'm all ears.  [end]
[start] What country? What’s the situation and how can we help if we’re across the globe? [end]
[start] 6 months ago I would not have believed you. But I spent 2 weeks at the refugee camp in moria, Greece, and in my short time there I met so many people from all over the middle east and Africa who are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  One of my best friends now is Persian, and I thought all Iranians wished "death to America." It's all a lie, we're just people.  I pray for peace in your region OP, I sympathize with your plight.  [end]
[start] >I can safely speak for the vast majority of us saying that we just wish to live our lives quietly, raise our children, go to work, enjoy the weekend, watch Netflix & chill. We do not want war.  I have been to every major country in the world and I can safely say the vast majority of the people *everywhere* (apart from maybe where Netflix isn't available) feel the same way.  [end]
[start] “War is where the young and stupid are tricked by the old and bitter into killing each other.” [end]
[start] The quote from doctor who comes to mind:   “Because it’s not a game, Kate! This is a scale model of war. Every war ever fought, right there in front of you. Because it’s always the same. When you fire that first shot, no matter how right you feel, you have no idea who’s going to die! You don’t know who’s children are going to scream and burn. How many hearts will be broken. How many lives shattered. How much blood will spill until everybody does what they were always going to have do from the very beginning. Sit down and talk!”  With that being said, it’s the average person who suffers during war. Leaders don’t represent the population as unfortunate as it is.    [end]
[start] Democracy doesn't exist in america when it comes to foreign policy or economic issues, which are very connected. Voters don't get to decide whether or not the cia will attempt another regime change this week. They don't even get to know about it. The justifications for both Iraq wars and Vietnam were based on lies.  [end]
[start] Dear /r/hi_sigh_bye, you feel powerless. You and your fellow citizens collectively are not. I refer you to the [People Power revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Revolution) in which the people of the Philippines peacefully ousted a dictator, and to the demonstrations that brought about the [fall of the Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall#Fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall).  It can be done. [end]
[start] know that we are in much the same predicament. although we have no expectation of bombs falling on our cities we too DO NOT WANT A WAR. we have no desire to send our sons and daughters to be killed. (and for what? as you said, to prop up the egos of  power-hungry psychos?)  we are being ignored by our government (hell, we wern't even consulted) just as much as you are being ignored by your's. [end]
[start] Just for the record, as an American soldier.  We don't want to go to war either.  Fighting and possibly dying in a nation other than my own for interests that hold no concerns or benefit to my nation are so far beyond what I signed up for. [end]
[start] This is an interesting conversation to be had. I recently watched the Vise coverage of the Ukraine conflict and I'm blown away by how complex the whole thing is. No one wants a war, but are you going to let Russia literally invade part of the country? Do you stand for that? If you don't fight them now then they might continue. If you do fight, pro-Russian Ukrainian fighters will get killed along with a lot of innocent people in the middle. If you do nothing, you lose a big part of your country to another war hungry nation. So what is the correct action to be taken?  Who knows! I'm happy I'm not the world leader dealing with this mess. No matter what you do it's bad, you can't win. It depends what you value more. The West values their borders more than the lives of 10,000 people, Russia values an ally between the west and itself more than the 10,000 peoples lives, and everyone wants the war to stop. So who's wrong? There was a big part of the population that wanted to be separated from Ukraine especially after the government opened fire on innocent people. Does it make sense to separate? Was it worth the 10,000 killed, just to set up a country with frankly not too many differences than Ukraine?   And all that just to say, no one wants a war. But sometimes there needs to be a war. I'm personally always hoping for the most peaceful resolution, but when a country like Russia denies it's involvement, the west backs a government that killed it's own people and has a history of corruption, there really is no right side.  What does no war look like in Ukraine? How do you not fight a war there?  Point being, we all hope there is no war, but sometimes there is no other option. Most of the time there are, but sometimes there aren't. And it's not always the world leaders that are the problem.  [end]
[start] Reposting to my DA account [end]
[start] We may not be able to sway the minds of our leaders but we may be able to sway the minds of our fellow men and women in the military. It is up to them to decide whether or not to carry out orders, for the powers that be have shown they are not responsible enough to make these decisions.  [end]
[start] I too want to Netflix and Chill.  [end]
[start] I hear you, as well.  I wish you the best of luck, and hope that everything pans out in the best way possible.  I think MOST people, regardless of whatever country they are from, are adult enough to realize it isn't the citizens of XYZ state that are evil or corrupt or power-hungry, but an upper echelon of angry old men, or those seeking their power.    As an American, I don't blame anybody in Russia for Putin and his actions.  I would hope the world would understand that Trump does not represent the best of America, either.  (Look back to Obama.) [end]
[start] Most world leaders are only puppets to their masters. You need to go after those who make money from every war.  [end]
[start] I hear you. I wish you, your family, your friends, and your people to stay well and stay safe, keep your spirits up. If the situation does escalate, don't allow anyone to break you. Please let us know if there is anything else we can do to help! Thousands of Redditors would be more than happy to contribute to you and your country directly! [end]
[start] Wow, this is very powerful and touching. Trust me, as someone in the American military and someone who KNOWS what’s going on. I hate it for WE the people, the EARTHS people. I (we) all know who controls these wars. We KNOW it’s not all Muslims, all blacks, all whites, all Mexicans, all native Americans, all Europeans, all Russians, all Chinese and Japanese, and everyone else. It’s the ignorant people who are racists towards the people because of “our” leaders. I hope and pray you all make it out ok and we can work together one day... I am sorry. If you ever want or need to talk.. please do not hesitate to message me. [end]
[start] did....did.... this person just vaguebook?  [end]
[start] What country are you referring to? What is your country and the aggressor country? [end]
[start] My heart goes out to you and everyone.  [end]
[start] im proud to say the country i live in has no soldiers out of the country for offensive reasons at the moment, ill keep you in my prayers man, stay safe. [end]
[start] Warlords will gain anytime there is a power vacuum.  The Middle East has no superpower to keep down the warlords.  You can leave now, wait until one of the warlords consolidated power to become the superpower, or become a warlord yourself. There are no good options.  [end]
[start] Powerful message. Thank you for getting it out there. Know that as an American I agree with you and feel no prejudice against you or your people consciously. Good luck and stay safe. [end]
[start] What do you expect Reddit to do?  [end]
[start] There is a very powerful message here. WE do not want war. The people, who they serve, do not want war. However, in this day and age, it seems we only serve them.    I’m not trying to be that guy but if our society wants to do some shit like travel into deep space and colonize other planets we should probably just get the fuck along because we’re literally on a big fucking rock circling around a much larger fiery ball and all of it is making a beeline for the end of existence. We might as well make the most of it and get along and be happy until the end. [end]
[start] > The world has got to end the madness caused by several hundred people who hold the power.    There are not several hundred people who hold the power.  This is an illusion.    [This is the real situation](https://i.imgur.com/DPU1amQ.jpg).    If you are correct and the majority of your region's people do not want war--  not like they aren't supporting the war, but that they DO NOT WANT A WAR--  then they should stand up and say so.    If you are correct and the majority of your region's people do not want war, then your enemy is not your leaders, your enemy is apathy of your fellow citizens.  Apathy in that they are too busy going about their lives to stand up and demand peace, demand removal of warmongering leaders, etc.    You want to live in peace and go about your lives and raise your children in safety.  Everybody wants this.  But you may have to fight for it.  If you are going to fight for it, that means you may have to leave your safe lives and fight- demand to be heard- protest, make noise, write newspaper articles, write to your government, go on TV, demand new leaders, etc.    ------  > I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain.   > --John Adams    Adams was on the right track, but he forgot that there will always be those who look to take advantage of a people.    > “Naturally the common people don’t want war. But after all, it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy, and it’s always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  This is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger.  It works the same in every country.”   > --Hermann Goering, Hitler’s Reichmarschall, at the Nuremberg Trials after World War II    So while Adams's grandchildren study painting and poetry, they must also be proficient in politics and war, so they know how to deal with a leader like Goering describes.    Unfortunately most of modern civilization has forgotten this.  We have become a society of painters and poets and architects who don't pay attention to politics.  And the result is it's easy for bad leaders to abuse us.    I don't know what country you're from OP, but as Goering said, it works the same in every country.  It worked / continues to work on us here in the US.  I wish you the best of luck. [end]
[start] I wish I had something better to say, but in absence of that I'll say that I hear you loud and clear. What's been happening in middle eastern countries makes me feel shocked and angry and helpless and sad. Growing up as a white boy in a first-world country I had the privilege of getting to tell myself for a long time that our species, while still leaving much to be desired overall, was by and large inching towards a more peaceful, tolerant, open, and compassionate version of itself. I still don't know if that was all a naïve illusion to begin with or if we actually made the pendulum swing the other way at some point in the past 15 years, but that feeling has sure been ripped to shreds lately. It's become so hard not to get cynical, but I firmly believe that the moment we give in to cynicism, we're lost.  Take care, OP. May sense prevail. [end]
[start] If you were anything other than a troll, you would have detail.  How is your message going to save lives?  War costs lives and the other themes of your post are not original. The topic of your post gives the impression that you have specific information about the local issue or how to stop it escalating.   [end]

[start] Here is the problem. It's not that other countries do not wish to help or intervene when citizens are in danger, it's how and how much. When does 'help' become occupation? What is the outcome? How much of the life you have had before are you going to give up for change when the kind of change you get may not be the most ideal? [end]
[start] unfortunately this is completely out of our hands  defense contractors make a lot of money solving problems their way.  and they are working both sides of the conflict.   we will be tricked into total annihilation. global warming and egomaniacs are not the doom envisioned by proponents of colonizing space and mars.  it's the bulletproof profit made by selling bullets and missiles to both sides.  All they have to say is "the other side already put in our largest order ever for ______________"  fear of missing out.  we are all doomed and have zero control over it [end]
[start] Government runs countries. Who lives in countries? Public. If public strikes and protests hard, (not violently) then who will have to make a decision. It falls upon us. We just have to have the heart to make an effort and sacrifice. But then people will say “why should I? I have bills to pay and a child to feed” think outside the box and for the greater good people. If we really want to make a change we all need to come together and do something rather than talk about what some can do. Sacrifices must be made for change, and even though it may suck, it’s what must be done for peace.  [end]
[start] Wish you the best my guy, no one I know wants war either it's crazy how we can do nothing about it, much love here from cali [end]
[start] You should read about WWI. It was literally a handful of guys who decided they didn't like Serbians and started a massive war.  Other than massive protests or targeted murders, I'm not sure there's a lot more that can be done. [end]
[start] Everyone knows that the average folk does not want war and that war is and always have been nothing but a fight for power of the politicians and rulers. Its a real pity that all that majority that wants to simply be left alone and watch netflix didnt actually do anything to make it happen. It could have deprived its own government from the right to start a war, and when a conflict arises, people could take a vote on how to handle it. If we are smart enough to choose between people offering different policies anyways, we could certainly choose directly between the exact policies aswell.   Or you know, we could also understand and trust the market that has provided you practically everything that you like and enjoy in your life, and allow it to bring its efficiency into thr fields of security, defense and law, which would mean dismantling the entire State as a whole. Then there would be no one to start a war. Walmart can't do it, and there would be nothing in the stateless society but businesses trying their best to sell stuff, except that those stuff will now include enforcing your property rights and crime-insurance.  The average folks has nothing to complain about. The arguments about how war, conscripton, national debt, taxes, depressions and corruption can be stopped once and for all have been out there for decades if not for a century. And all these average folks that only want to be left alone choosed to attack anyone who proposed them, and went to vote ever increasing power to politicians obediently.   Face it. We all know that we need a new system and that the current onr is complely and ultimately unsustainable. We just dont want to face it, nor do we want to fight for our freedom like our ancestors did. But sadly, our choice is not between fighting and peace. After two world wars, everyone should acknowledge that. Our choice is to fight for freedom or to fight for giving more and more money and power to our rulers, and to save their hide in the incoming collapse. States love going to war when they are running out of money. And now - just look at the national debt/gdp ratio - they are runninh out of money. [end]
[start] How do you expect bad dictators to be removed from power?   Do you really think war is never justified?   Was it not justified to stop Hitler?   Why don't you actually talk about the pros and cons of a specific choice, rather than an overgeneralizing knee jerk reaction?  [end]
[start] That’s how it’s always been... and likely always will be. We can talk on the internet about how we hate war, but what does that matter to hardened killers. Power corrupts. It’s not that these war mongers are special, they may very well have had strong morals or wishes of prosperity once upon a time. Yet years of doing things for the “greater good” soaked them in blood. Or maybe they really were just rotten to begin with. In either case it doesn’t matter. Your best course of action is to stand with your local community, prepare, and try and holdout till this cycle of conflict ends. Like a storm. [end]
[start] Yeah, we know. Unfortunately there are a few assholes running our countries who think having a military without using it is a waste of money so they create problems to 'solve'. [end]
[start] You must resist and raise the resistance to include those who are on your side. Speak all day everyday and find others who will join you in protest. If nobody fights, there is no war.  [end]
[start] The only way our country would  "help" is by sending troops weapons advisors and ultimately more death.  [end]
[start] Wars are prosecuted by rich men at the expense of poor people.  It's always about their money.   Always. [end]
[start] That’s what happened in the US in the 70’s. Our government forced its young men to go die in a jungle. It was terrible. I’m sorry, you can enact change by organizing protests against your government’s actions. Arab Spring! [end]
[start] >no one wants to fight  Global workers revolution or riot. The reason I don't support a lot of these rebels and insurgent groups is because they're so very, very often just as fascist as the people they kicked out. I'm American, my fight to help you begins at home. We have to stop arming and aiding war. When you stop making war, war stops. People choose not to believe that but it's true. It's not that I don't want to fight, I just think the cause of your conflict is not necessarily you or your government.  [end]
[start] If leaders are the problem, simply deny them an army to use. Refuse to fight and there will be no fighting. [end]
[start] While I can't say whether you can avoid war, I believe that if you ultimately choose to revolt against the ruling, violent powers, your revolution should include two basic practices:  1. A "nonviolence day", before *and* after a successful revolution. One day a month, people gather in the streets in an affirmation of nonviolence. It should be neither secular nor religions nor political and affirm nonviolence. It is a constant preparedness of the people to move *en mass* (altogether) to stand up to the ruling powers.  2. A daily practice with dinner: a single item (a rock, a small sculpture, a child's drawing, anything) is placed on the table with dinner to represent one thing: that *nonviolence must be on the table*. This is needed because in the event of a successful nonviolence-based revolution (such as the early part of the Egypt 2011 revolution), people will promptly *forget the role of nonviolence*.   Nonviolence may seem inadvisable. But the fact is that neither violence nor nonviolence are guaranteed to succeed as a revolution. But there are some basic points to bear in mind in the case of *failure*:  -- A failed nonviolence based revolution will have far fewer deaths and injuries than a failed violence based revolution. It is better to fail in a nonviolence-based revolution than in a violence-based revolution  -- nonviolence-based revolution prompts more defection than violence-based revolution  -- Even in a failed nonviolence-based revolution, more can participate  In the case of success, the government that is developed after a successful nonviolence-based revolution is likely to be less violent.  I don't know what country you are in, but I believe that nonviolence-based revolution is the only real solution. But these two steps, *or something like them*, are necessary. In particular, they must occur *after any successful revolution*. You can be sure that in the case of a successful nonviolence-based revolution, all talk at that point will do one thing: it will *fail to remember the importance and role of nonviolence leading up to the change of government*. This forgetting is the problem. [end]
[start] This is why the internet can be such a wonderful place.. it brings people from all over the world together to discuss any issues they want, even such grim ones. Even people from what are supposed to be 'enemy' countries.  I am from Israel and this is exactly how I feel, the governments all over the world, but especially in the Middle East area, are extremely corrupt and politicians & religious leaders use violence and rhetoric to keep themselves in power. [end]
[start] What's worse is the top brass that begin such nightmares have a secure bunker to go to and get to live in relative luxury while everyone else suffers.  I think the only possibility is for troops to refuse to go to battle, good luck there [end]

[start] > The leaders of our countries do not represent our best interest, and unfortunately, we have no influence on what they are doing.    Welcome to the world. [end]
[start] Its pretty much too late. Jews just announced Iran or Syria is enriching uranium, in english. Which means they are trying to garnish US support. Which means we are a couple months or maybe a year away from either all out war or some kind of terror or state sponsored attack on the US. [end]
[start] > World leaders have become and isolated group of ego maniacs, disconnected from their people's wish, playing geo-political warfare games with the lives of millions and millions of people  >>have become  Implying  [end]
[start] I don't want my country anywhere near the middle East and I honestly think it would be a better place had we never gone there. [end]
[start] Israel or Iran I'm guessing?  [end]
[start] Tell your leaders that, they seem intent on pushing that button.  [end]
[start] Our leaders want to fight. No one here wants to either. There’s money to be made with your land, and for that I’m sorry our leaders try to exploit that. [end]
[start] Am an Israeli, can confirm.  [end]
[start] I dont think my country should go to war to save a middle eastern country only for them to turn around and hate us. We learned our lesson the hard way. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I feel like Israelis are pro war  [end]
[start] Like you said, this war is between psychotic world leaders. Israel,  appears to be the biggest instigator in the escalation in Syria and now Netanyahu is also begging the world into war with Iran...but, Israel is too cowardly to take Iran on by themselves so they get their agents in the US to bring America to war for them.  As an American, I do not personally know of anyone who wants to go to war yet again in the Middle East for some other county's benefit. We are all sick and tired of the daily propaganda and the lies being told by the news outlets. We are all sick and tired knowing our government is behind the killings and the atrocities being committed in our name. We all want peace. But, this hatred and thirst for war and bloodshed seems to be happening on a level that Americans can't reach to be heard. I have tried on numerous occasions to reach my "representatives", but all I get are canned responses.  US Government no longer represents the will of the people. We are a nuisance that gets in the way of their corporate and geopolitical agendas.   Ever since 9/11, it seems that day has entitled psychopathic western leaders to do what ever they want...some of us know the truth that Muslims DID NOT hijack those planes, but in fact the whole thing was a zionist plot to bring Americas military to the Middle East to be used by Israel.     I wish you the best and I sincerely hope no harm comes your way. Peace~ [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] What country brreee [end]
[start] lol ok [end]
[start] Israelis are not mentioned. It is possible that average citizens in those Muslim states you mention do not wish war - but some of their governments do feel it is needed - so they restart it  in each decade. And their main argument is Israel. As if they had somehow less right to live there than others. So I will believe you want peace when you will mention that Israel also wants peace.   Of course we are not really heard. Reddit is just reaching maybe a few thousand people but it is not easy to persuade each other on an anonymous platform. If  the Russian and Iranian and Turkish leaders need to prove their strength and provoke the Saudis on the side of the US - where Israel has 70 million Christian Ziinist voters who want to preserve Israel due to Biblical prophecies - than the first thing yiu should begin wuth would be to work on the cooperation between Sunnis and Shi'ites. Until these two griups actively fight each other / in Yemen/ your words sound naive and your plea seems tragic.   Nobody wants war. It just happens because we are not wise enough. In all the countries of the world there are strict aggressive groups and less strict peaceful groups. In the habds if the powerful tyrants and leaders a war is just a tool to destroy the less strict group that threatens their central power.  But it would be interesting if your desperate letter would start a movement against war in the countries that are the most irresponsable due to psychilogically deeply hurt leaders. Who will first try to imprison such defetist pacifists as you. Be careful and change your name to some throwaway new name. [end]
[start] Are you talking about the eternal idiot war between Shia and Sunni? The rest of the world should stay out of it. If you are talking about something else, tell us what, and what country you are in. [end]

[TITLE] I just went to Japan at 18 by myself. [TITLE]
[start] Wow, what a cool experience! And a very cool write-up! I finish college in a year and I'd love to have more experiences like that. My entire life has been in Dallas or Chicago, so I feel pretty uncultured. Adding Japan to my bucket list! [end]
[start] Good for you man. Your post inspires me. I’m 25 and I still haven’t left my home country. You’re a strong dude. [end]
[start] That’s awesome! [end]
[start] I travel alone. The best thing about it is that it's so cleansing. You're basically on your own and the freedom you get from just being there on your own is the best thing ever!  Besides, I might want to visit Japan soon. Could you tell me the name of that bar with funk vinyls you went to? [end]
[start] I'm proud of you, dude. It takes a surprisingly large amount of courage to travel on your own, especially at your age. At the same time, these kinds of experiences are incredibly valuable for helping you grow and learn who you are. [end]
[start] Congratulations chief. That is the adventure of a lifetime. And it looks like it did you good. [end]
[start] Good for you!  I lived there for two years and loved every minute of it [end]
[start] I’m 40.  I’ve been all over the Caribbean, to Italy, Japan , Mexico and Canada.  I have had an interesting life.          Nothing has had an effect on me quite like travel.  It’s eye opening, cosmopolitan and educational.  It’s change my view and outlook on life rapidly.  Keep doing it.  Go everywhere. [end]
[start] Yay! You should be proud of yourself. Not many people can say they did what you have accomplished. Do you plan on returning? [end]
[start] What a nice post. I can distinctly remember a similar feeling of being alone in the airport on my first overseas trip.  You may not appreciate this fully quite yet, but at 18 years old you are just on the cusp of a level of freedom and independence that you have never had before. For all the responsibilities that come with adulthood, you also have the opportunity to live your life in whatever way you want to live it. So often, I think the thing that holds us back from living our lives the fullest is fear. Fear that we won't be strong enough to do something, or the fear of going against the status quo. You rightfully identified the fact that you conquered both of those fears on this trip.  The travel experiences that I had in my early twenties really were some of the foundational experiences that I've carried with me. Good luck in all the adventures to come. [end]
[start] Wow. A good Reddit post. Rare [end]
[start] Woooot! [end]
[start] Isn’t it amazing to travel alone? I love doing it! Congratulations on making a goal and doing it. Especially at 18. I wish I would have been that brave at 18. [end]
[start] This is the neatest Japan trip write-up I’ve seen in a while. I’ve been living here two years and sometimes on various subreddits I see some pretty repetitive posts (always fawning over the kindness of Japanese people and the beautiful tourist spots) and I don’t see much introspection like this, especially from someone your age. Good for you. Keep being awesome, and come back and visit again soon! [end]
[start] Holy shit dude this is pretty rad. Congratulations on your accomplishment and self revelations! [end]
[start] Wow sounds like you're an old soul in a young body! Looks to me that you had a great experience and came out with what wanted and more. Try a hostel next time you travel! Especially in Tokyo they've got really great ones there. The conversations you get when you meet people from different times in their life and all the different places is incredible. We love talking to people like you who travel so independently and a fresh look on life.   Just wanted to drop that bit of advice for the future, loved reading your post and thanks for sharing! [end]
[start] Just the post I needed to see right now! Over the summer I am flying across the country to see a friend of mine. I’m 15 and going to be flying alone for the first time. Kinda nervous but if you did it maybe I can do it too? Lol [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing this. When I was younger I wanted to do this and never did. Tokyo was my dream. Now I'm almost 50 and still regret it but I'm proud of you and I will make sure my kids reach for their dreams. [end]
[start] I can really relate. I wrote a article about a really revolutionary idea I had for a magazine when I was really young and they wouldn't publish it, rather they wanted me to turn it into a paper and present it at an International conference in Amsterdam. So never having been on a plane before, I was off to Europe alone. When I got to the conference room it was empty and I was relieved because no one wanted to hear my lecture but I quickly found out it had been moved to the main theater because hundreds had signed up to hear it (never done public speaking before that either but somehow I managed to own it). It was a trip!  I very much enjoyed your story. [end]
[start] that's amazing! wish I was on your level. I don't even like to eat alone in a restaurant- I take it to my car and then eat alone haha [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] From my own personal experience traveling alone could be so comfortable. After you get over the fact that you don't know anybody and the small moment of feeling lonely it is exhilarating having this time all for yourself and the only person you need to worry about would be just for yourself too.  I always recommend people to even just take a few days for themselves to go to another city if they are able to. Feels like having a minor reset in your life if you so happen to be stressed. [end]
[start] I will be going to Japan as an 18 year old as well in a few weeks. I’m Hispanic too and I’ve always felt that the culture shock would be somewhat comforting. It’s cool reading about someone that has gone through the same experience. Any places in Tokyo I should visit? [end]
[start] That sounds like an incredible experience! I want to travel at a certain point, but mere survival/bills make it impossible even with a full time job + apartment crowding. Next check I can afford to go out for a couple $1.50 sushi specials though, so it’s not all bad! [end]
[start] I’m 19 from Detroit Michigan area, and thinking about moving to Seattle in a month. [end]
[start] So happy for you! I can relate to this so bad, I went to Tokyo on my own when I was 20 and you do really learn a lot about yourself. It's like a leap of faith having to depend on yourself to take care of everything from booking flights to buying rice balls at 7-Eleven. Really brave of you and seems like it was a real success. [end]
[start] I'm proud of you!!! You mentioned you are latinx, are you by any chance first generation? It doesn't matter much, but I grew up first generation here in the U.S and Latino parents from the motherland can be very tough at times. ...lol anyway I'm proud of you that you did this. I'm proud that you learned about yourself. You have the whole world in front of you right now, keep discovering yourself friend. ❤️ [end]
[start] I (17M) actually did the same thing you did, I traveled to japan last December, to see one of my favorite artists, The Weeknd. I saved up the money for my self, and as I live in Malaysia, the tickets weren't too expensive. I Have always loved japan as a kid and really wanted to go. I had loved their culture, food and everything surrounded by them. I was 16 at the time (recently turned 17) and this was my first experience being truly alone. It is quite noticeable when I got there that I was the only foreigner in my hotel and rarely see other people not from japan. It was also hard to find anyone who spoke english Like you said, It was quite hard for me, as I really felt alone. I went around and ate, site-saw, and did a bunch of things, but the whole time I truly felt alone. (i might have been a tad bit depressed. But its great that you enjoyed yourself and had fun, and really learned from your experience, plus you got to see your favorite place and thats amazing too! [end]
[start] You had your own walk about. Congratulations. [end]
[start] When I read the beginning, I thought that post is made by my friend, that is currently at Japan. He chose that he would rather to have travel to Japan instead of having birthday party. [end]
[start] good for you! i envy people with the courage to travel abroad on their own. I want to travel but could never fathom doing it alone. [end]
[start] man, im in philadelphia ,and im also hispanic ! not too far away and i have no friends to travel with, youre not too far at all  , lets travel together  🤷‍♀️ [end]
[start] You just made it comfortable to me, thanks OP. I have a trip to Turkey and I'm a middle Eastern never leaving their country. Glad to see someone who's younger and have already done it.  Wishing you more exotic journeys. [end]
[start] good for you! ive been wanting to travel but constantly putting it off. thanks for the inspiration. [end]
[start] I definitely want to do this, I’m also 18 as of a couple days ago and I also skate lol, Tokyo is like you say a very vibrant city and I can’t wait to go and skate there, even if it is by myself [end]
[start] I'm 32. I've never flown, but I've driven across the country quite a ways, to the east coast and as far south and west as Texas. Never thought I'd been outside the country but I found out that this island amusement park my grandmother used to take us to when we were little was Canadian.   Traveling abroad on your own as soon as you turned 18 is pretty cool.  I think the main reason I never did much traveling in life is because I was depressed. No point in going anywhere if you're incapable of enjoying anything. The last year or two has been different, though, the depression is behind me. I might go somewhere eventually. Always wanted to see the Northern Lights. [end]
[start] Hey, I've been wanting to go also. Could you DM me? I have a few questions if you wouldn't mind answering them. Thanks! [end]
[start] I wanna do something similar. How much money did you spend in total. I have 0 clue as to how much I should save. [end]
[start] That's so awesome! I think everyone should travel alone to far away place. You learn so much about yourself!  I remember my first time travelling alone to London at 20 years of age. Holy shit was I nervous! First day was awful but I slowly got more confident. Compared to Japan I guess it was quite easy since everyone speaks English. [end]
[start] Damn I envy you man. [end]
[start] What's your instagram? [end]
[start] Hi, French 17 ish boy, I done the same thing last year, when I gone alone for 1 month in Australia. My first trip without my parents. For 36 hours I was alone in planes, airports. With only music for only company. I had a stopover at Guangzhou where no one was talking English and I litteraly shat myself like 3 times. :'D But in the end, I finally succeeded my périple and enjoyed my month in Melbourne. And made a ton of friends with whom I'm still in touch today. Be in an Australian school was very rewarding and I learn a lot because of the higher level of the Australian school system. So, to everyone who's hesitant to travel alone or to study in foreign countries. Just go, jump on the occasion you will have no regret! Sorry for bad English have a nice day! [end]
[start] How much preperation and research did you do before going and how much roughly did it cost in total? Ive been thinking of going on my own solo adventure at one point. [end]
[start] Congratulations man I'm happy for you, I'm leaving for Paris in a month, it'll be my first time out of the country too. That's super cool of you too make that trip solo, lotta guts! [end]
[start] Nice job bro, you're living the dream :) [end]
[start] Good for you. You’re an inspiration, not for your travels but for your enlightened message about them. [end]
[start] That’s amazing dude! Well done for going and getting what you wanted. Life is too short to stay in the same place waiting for the right moment. [end]
[start] You are a brave young man! Congratulatons! How did your parents let you go to a foreign country so far away on your own? I wouldn't let my kids do that! [end]
[start] fuck yeah, good on you! I'm proud of you. Kept thinking of Lost in Translation whilst I was reading this. [end]
[start] Eerily reminiscent of the first fateful trip to Japan that got Phil Knight started in the shoe business. Not only in the culture shock — but most strikingly in the fierce sense of youthful independence and ambition.  Good for you, nurture these sensations. If Phil’s life is any evidence, they lead to great achievements.  Oh, and Shoe Dog (Knight’s autobiography) is not a bad read if you’re interested. [end]
[start] Ok [end]
[start] If i can save up the money,  im going next year to Japan alone [end]
[start] Hi! I 100% get that amazing feeling you'vw experienced - I myself went to Moscow last summer alone at the age of 18. For me, it was a little uncomfortable as well telling my relatives, friends & family that I'd go alone. And I also didn't quite grasp that my family would really let me do this, since Moscow is a little over 2000km away from my home. Like you, I also experienced a new comfort with being by myself and really doing this on my own. I'm proud of you and happy to hear that someone else also had something similar to my experience. [end]
[start] This is seriously impressive and inspiring. I often find myself looking up places I can go to on my own  but always end up chickening out.  The idea of culture shock and going up to people I don’t know and trying to make friends scare me. But man would it be awesome! I’m also impressed that you started with Japan. [end]
[start] I always feel awkward telling other people I'm proud of them for some reason, but I don't have any other way to describe what I'm feeling. Keep doing things like this, keep loving life. It's the best thing you could ever give yourself. [end]
[start] Man I wish I had balls like you to pull something like this off at only 18. Really happy for you man, and it makes me realize I have no excuse to be as lazy as Ive been. Keep on exploring and Im happy you had your experience [end]
[start] Shoulda hit me up I’d show you some cool spots, I’ve lived here for a year with at least 3 to go [end]
[start] This is so inspiring for me. I've been thinking of doing something similar for a while now. Just getting up and visiting Japan. Alone. On the other side of the world. It's a sublime feeling, really. To test my limits and see if I can make it work.  I'm saving this post for any future motivation I might be in need of. [end]
[start] :) [end]
[start] Did you ever miss having someone there to share the experience with? Several times I’ve wanted to go somewhere when no one else could but never did cause I thought it would be kinda lonely doing all that stuff by yourself. [end]
[start] Good for you and congratulations! Keep adventuring!!! [end]
[start] Good for you. If more people would do stuff like this, they wouldn’t be sitting around depressed and whining about some guy or girl that doesn’t like them. Live Your life, lead a big life. Best wishes- you are DOING it. [end]
[start] Heh. Weeb. [end]
[start] Wow so cool!!!!! I would love to go there. [end]
[start] Wow only 18?? Good for you! You seem like an incredibly strong person and I hope to god you keep that same attitude as you age. As long as you stay dedicated to yourself, learning, and experiencing new things, you will definitely turn out to be an awesome human being. Super proud of you and I don’t even know you 🥺  Also I wish you had talked to me before you went. I ALWAYS tell people that it’s important to learn some Japanese before you go. The country mostly caters to the Japanese so it can be tough lol. I think you handled it well though so that’s good at least. [end]
[start] I went to Japan by myself at 16 years old on high school exchange for almost a year and let me tell you that was one of the best experiences of my life! I matured a lotttt faster than my peers and ended up graduating from high school a year and a half early haha. [end]
[start] Damn, that honestly sounds like a dream. I’m 17 and I don’t think I could ever build up that courage! How’d you go about it? Also how did you propose it to your parents? [end]
[start] This is amazing. So happy you experienced this at an early age.    Side note: if you can disclose. What’s the name of the bar that played funk? Definitely need to go there when I make it out there eventually. [end]
[start] I have been lucky enough to visit japan many times. My favorite places are Kyoto and Nara. I mirror the culture shock experience, jPan is a different world. It is a great place for solo travel, just about everyone is friendly and helpful and the country is very safe. [end]
[start] So you didn’t experience having to Mario Kart in Japan? [end]
[start] Nice buddy! Japan is so great isn’t it? Im 19 and moved here last year by myself and I’m lovin life ever since. It’s so liberating. [end]
[start] Bro, remember these moments when you are tempted to go at a girl raw dog because the ability to to such things can disappear in the blink of an eye. [end]
[start] Good for you in every aspect. I just got back from Japan and it had some similar affects on the way I look at things and I’m 24. [end]
[start] I love this!!!! The fact that you came out of your comfort zone and did this...I’m in Awww. Much respect to you. What’s your IG if you don’t mind me asking? [end]
[start] Just so you know, a 36 year old with a bunch of life experience is super jealous of your attitude and trip. [end]
[start] My kid is in Japan now Im sure you couldn't mistake him for a non American lol. [end]
[start] Oh my God, this is literally me. I just came back from Japan and I've been wanting to go since I was 14. I went by myself and I'm 18. [end]
[start] Good for you. Travel broadens the horizons. [end]
[start] You’re an inspiration. I would never have the courage to travel to France (my dream location) like you did Japan. I’m glad your trip lived up to your expectations, cheers! [end]
[start] I love this so much. I have traveled quite a bit, both with my wife and by myself, including a semester in Spain (inspired similar to your trip to Japan). Hell, I worked for an airline for years, just so I could fly for free. Reading about other people's experiences taking a major trip for the first time ever, especially going solo and doing your own thing, trying to figure out how a new culture works, always makes me happy.  If you ever get the opportunity, I would strongly suggest looking into Hong Kong (especially over Chinese New Year, if only to avoid pollution), Spain, Prague, or Turkey. Along with Japan, those places seemed the most unique while still very manageable for an American. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] thats so sick dude great story [end]
[start] i'm excited and happy for you to have been able to experience something like that! i've strongly considered doing something similar, to an english speaking country for my convinience, but i didn't truly believe  in myself before this. [end]
[start] Nice, I'm hoping to do the same thing in Spain/ Italy in a few months. What were you doing before you met people? I'm worried I'll just end up being really lonely. [end]
[start] I'd love to do this but the language barrier scares me. Terrified to get lost [end]
[start] r/solotravel [end]
[start] Congratulations man I'm happy for you, I'm leaving for Paris in a month, it'll be my first time out of the country too. That's super cool of you too make that trip solo, lotta guts! [end]
[start] That's great! The world needs more of people doing what you have done! Eyes open to the world and new experiences and being receptive to new experiences!  You will go far. I promise you [end]
[start] That's amazing! Travelling really hits you hard, huh? I'd love to do some more travelling myself. There's something different about doing it with that certain kind of freedom. Don't even consider this bragging; everyone's proud of you! [end]
[start] A lot of people don't realize how much your worldview changes after leaving the country for the first time. [end]
[start] You should continue traveling and write a journal of your trips. [end]
[start] This is inspiring I’m really impressed by all of it. [end]
[start] Congrats, what a wonderful and brave thing to do. [end]
[start] You give me hope for the future. [end]
[start] I’m really proud of you, OP! I hope you start planning for next trip. [end]
[start] That’s fantastic! I’m so happy for you. I did the same thing but I was more than ten years older than you. Still, it was the best thing I’ve ever done. I cried coming home because I was so glad I went there.  My friend in japan talked about coming home after traveling, how it’s hard to relate to people and the problems of home seem so small. It’s good to leave and get perspective.  I also expected traveling to be more of an “eat your vegetables” kind of experience. Something you’ll be glad you did later. But it was actually more like eating candy. It was so immediately extremely pleasurable and eye opening. Good luck in your future! [end]
[start] Dude there’s no better education you can give yourself then traveling the world and going at it alone. The best thing (in my opinion) is the opportunity to meet local people wherever you are and gain a legit experience. Good for you dude. [end]
[start] WEEB /s. Seriously, sounds really cool. I've been trying to save up to take a trip when I turn 18 too and you've renewed my inspiration. [end]
[start] Learning to find joy when you are alone is a milestone step in self-improvement and the pursuit of happiness. [end]
[start] Once you get the travel bug, it never goes away and it's like going down a rabbit hole. Chase it and embrace it, travel is the path to enlightenment and inner peace. [end]
[start] Dude I dont even know you and I'm proud of you. This made me happy. I love how realistic and genuine this post is. You go get em. [end]
[start] Hang on a sec... I thought the legal drinking age in Japan was 20. [end]
[start] Do not forget your feelings. Take this with you into your life and you will absolutely kill the game. [end]
[start] My best friend and I promised each other in 9th grade (almost 9 years ago, goddamn) that we'd go to Japan together. This year is supposed to be it, but who knows if it'll actually happen due to work and money.  You're so, so brave for actually seeing one of your dreams through and sticking with it. Kinda makes me wanna cry, ngl. lmao [end]
[start] That's so cool, I'd love to go to Japan.  Good for you! [end]
[start] envious. I’m 26 but am not allowed to travel to a country alone. #asianparents [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing that with us! I'm from the UK and would love to visit Japan but I'm a little apprehensive about going alone, mainly because of the vast difference in culture.  I'd like to visit Osaka (my favourite musician was born there) and also Tokyo.  Reading this though has helped allay some of my fears, sounds great out there!  I'll definitely have to brush up on my Japanese lol. [end]
[start] That's awesome! Kudos for you going out and earning that trip, making a bucket list and checking it off, with supportive parent on top of all that. That one trip has made you mature far faster then doing the same old thing as friends. Seeing the world and having to push yourself, really push yourself because you are totally on your own with no way out forces you to learn who you are. This will probablybe be a life defining moment for a long time, and it's even better that you're able to see mistakes you made in the past that hindered you.  I lived in Japan for 2 years back in my 20's. It was eye opening. The place was more, and less than what I ever imagined. I loved the history, I hated the racism against Americans from older Japanese, though I understood why. I loved driving through the mountains, the food was so good it ruined most "Japanese" food in the US. The bars were similar, yet different. Getting sake in Denny's, yes, the same place you go for breakfast, was paradigm breaking in a good way, missing the last train by 30 seconds and sleeping on a park bench until the train starts running again and being a smorgasbord for mosquitoes, hiking Mt. Fiji to see the sunrise while it's 35 degrees and only having a light jacket, it was the best of times! [end]
[start] Great post OP! I'm from Scotland and I turn 20 this year. I'm currently working full time to afford a working holiday Visa in Japan which would entail a year away in the country. Like you, I've never done anything like this before and I'm still a little nervous to go. Although after reading this, I feel a lot more confident about my decision and I'm now even more excited to go!   So thanks and I'm glad you had such a great travel experience! [end]
[start] As someone who traveled to Europe for a month with just my boyfriend at the age of 16, congrats to you!   The freedom of being on my own was eye-opening. Seeing different ways of life, really made me see things differently.   The best part, looking back, is that the fact my parents trusted me that much to make good decisions on my own, half a world away.   You are doing so many things right! Thank you for sharing your story! [end]
[start] I did the same when I was 19, went to Tokyo by myself for two weeks and had the best time ever. It’s definitely the people that make the holiday the best and most memorable. Though there are going to be some times when you feel a little lonely, can’t deny that, other than that though it’s the best feeling ever doing what YOU want to do and not having to go somewhere you don’t want to go if you’re travelling with a group. [end]
[start] How much did the trip cost and how long were you there for? [end]
[start] i’m also 18 and i plan on travelling solo one day so THANK YOU this gave me so much inspiration [end]
[start] Claps and maaaaaad respect!  But did you get any...? [end]
[start] Feeling like the odd race out as a Hispanic is probably something you're at least fairly used to.  As a white guy, I'm sure that would probably hit me like a train if it stood out to you so much. [end]
[start] Kudos. Life has much to offer. Steer clear of CSWs. When traveling alone we sometimes get the itch. Just remember the repercussions outweigh the benefits. [end]
[start] So when are you going back to Japan? [end]
[start] I envy you. Im 25 and I always wanted to Japan since I was a kid when I used to read alot of books about japan. I have the feeling im running out of time. If I would have the money I would immidietly go there ... [end]
[start] welcome to the club. /r/solotravel [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[TITLE] My boyfriend and I are in shock [TITLE]
[start] I hope you have the ability to talk to a professional about this. What you did was kind and you deserve to have someone help you contextualize what you did and saw and listen to how you feel.  Please speak to a professional about it. It's never too early. Your mental health is important.   Remember, people on Reddit are not trained professionals. [end]
[start] That’s tough to deal with. Thanks for helping. [end]
[start] Admiring the way you handled that tough situation. Most of us like to think we’d spring into action like that, but doing it is another thing. Sending you a big virtual hug [end]
[start] Sending you a big hug. Thanks for helping these people. It’s a good idea for you to talk to friends (or even a professional counsellor) about this experience, because this was traumatic to you, too, and needs to be processed. [end]
[start] You're putting this out there because you need to talk about it to help you process it. That's normal. You may need to talk about it for a while, and might want to consider getting some therapy/drugs to help you minimize PTSD. Meanwhile, we're here. Talk to us. [end]
[start] You’ll be wired for several more hours tonight, it’ll help if you watch a movie you’ve watched a lot before so you don’t have to think and have a chance to switch off. Or do some exercise to burn off the nervous energy. Going forward you’ll be ‘twitchy’ for at least a few days, maybe up to 2 weeks. There’s a chance you’ll both get easily irritated with each other and have a fight about stupid stuff (my favourite was about which cupboards the cups go in). Things will eventually calm down. Am glad you are getting someone to talk to. If you have symptoms at 3 - 6 months or start getting flashbacks definitely get professional help. You did a good thing and helped people today. Here if you need us. [end]
[start] You guys did a really good thing, and I'm glad you'll have each other to help work through this in the coming days.   For shock, I recommend a warm drink like herbal tea and a repetitive game, like tetris or some kind of lowkey mobile game (a match three style game maybe). It gives your brain something to focus on that's not too demanding, which can help. Good luck, and thank you for doing what you did. [end]
[start] It's... funny for a horrible lack of words, how sometimes a hundred times a day our lives could be over within 10 seconds and we never think about it.  Maybe you do that time when you lock up your brakes and some jerk who had a red light came within a foot of hitting you.  Times like that get you pissed and angry, and you go to work hours later and still talk down to others, don't thank those who help you, etc.  We all take life way too much for granted. [end]
[start] Wow, I am so sorry!!! Thats horrible!! My mom always says for me to put my feet down... shes right! Crazy [end]
[start] You experienced a very traumatic situation and I would suggest you speak with someone about the incident.  Best regards a volunteer lifeguard, security guard and crowd control specialist.  Shot will just pile up if you don’t get to go through and understand what really happened. I’ve done these situations a couple of times before, most notably being the first responder to a car crash. Just my two cents for you and I’m happy you reacted the way you did. [end]
[start] I used to be a Paramedic in NYC. I can’t even begin to count how many times that said now I’ve seen it all just to be shocked stupid with the next one. [end]
[start] I might get downvoted for this unpopular comment, but I gotta do the right thing.  I understand you tried to help and all, but I need to enlighten you and viewers of this post: In a car crash or any trauma related incident that there isn’t an imminent fire or other visible immediate life threatening risk that really requires you to move victims, you MUST NOT try to remove people from the wreck.  The main reasons are becaue crashes can cause lots of internal trauma that are not externally visible, and a relatively common one is a fractured disc, usually around the neck area. If you move the victim around, there is a chance for the movement to damage or cut the spinal cord, which could leave them partially or permanently handicap. This is why the first thing paramedics do on a crash site is to put a cervical collar on the victims. When you pull someone from a wreck, there is a chance bent and broken metal and plastic could lead to deep cuts, aggravating the victims situation and sometimes being fatal. Also, these types of accidents can cause severe internal bleeding that could be accelerated by body movement and higher pulse, which increases if the victim is walking, making unnecessary effort to stand, running, etc.  Now, what you actually need to do in a situation like this is, order by priority:  a) First make sure the road is safe and the accident is visible to incoming cars well before the crash site - use branches or any other object available to divert traffic to an unblocked lane in case you can’t find a reflective warning sign. The crash site safety is the number one thing you need to worry about, as you don’t want this problem to increase even more, increasing the number of victims, potentially including you. If there is someone with you, coordinate for one to help diverting traffic with a cell phone torch, while the other person looks after the victims  b) Make sure there is no life threatening material or broken parts that could cause imminent fire or additional hazard to the victims  c) Call 911 or the local emergency number for specialized help. If you are in 2, make sure you know who is calling 911. It’s common for crash sites with lots of people not call 911, because everyone assumes someone will do it, which, depending on the injuries, delayed medical help could reduce the chances of survival  d) Try to create enough space for the victims to brathe fresh air and feel comfortable. Enforce the bystanders to keep as much distance as possible  e) Stay by the victims side keeping a safe distance and try to comfort and calm them, mainly to make them feel supported and to reduce unnecessary high heart rate  f) Show leadership and speak firmly to enforce all the above to everyone on the crash site. Often times not only victims but bystanders are also in shock, and don’t behave smartly  hope this helps [end]
[start] You are amazing. You comforted someone in their ultimate time of need. You were someones angel.  Thank you to both of you for your kindness and quick actions. [end]
[start] Not all heroes wear capes!! Y’all some real lifesavers 🙏🙏and you guys should try and talk to somebody if you feel you need to [end]
[start] Hang in there. You did great.    I went through a similar experience several years ago. Driving home one summer night with the windows down and hear the screeches and twisted metal sounds of a car crash. Pull up on it and it's a bad two-car wreck. I grab a flashlight and jump out and like you I switched into autopilot. I tell my girlfriend to call 911 and then I run towards the accident. A couple of other cars had stopped and as luck would have it one of the cars that stopped had two nurses in it. They started handling the people in the cars and there was plenty of help for the medical side, so I go into safety mode and make sure the vehicles are shut down and check for fire and fuel leaks. Fortunately nothing there but it's a bad intersection to be stopped in so I grabbed a couple of the other people who stopped and position them on opposite sides of the scene with flashlights to block traffic, then I cleared some of the vehicles that had stopped to make a path for the ambo.  After that was done I go back to see how the nurses are doing. One victim is in really bad shape and her eyes were pointing in completely different directions with blood from the back of her head. Not good. The other was bumps and bruises and was sitting on the guard rail. He was drunk. Police showed up, then ambos so after they took over I got out of the way.        When I get back to my truck my girlfriend is completely locked up in the passenger seat. She hadn't moved after calling 911. She just had this blank stare going on. We drove home and didn't say much. Said goodnight early. We talked about it the next day and she just couldn't believe that I would jump out and do what I did. She said it didn't occur to her to do that and she didn't really know how to deal with that. I kind of didn't know what to say really. Different upbringings I suppose.    Thanks for getting involved. It matters. [end]
[start] I lost a buddy long ago that died in a crash because his feet were up on the dash. Terrible. [end]
[start] You two are great people! I dont know much but i would advice going to a therapist as this can be a traumatic experience [end]
[start] Thank you so much for doing this. A kind couple did the same for my daughter when she was in a similar situation and called me so I could be there with her. On behalf of the girl's mother whom you called, I thank you. [end]
[start] Christ almighty.  That sounds just terrible. You are a good person for helping.  While less physically traumatic, I had an experience like that a little over a decade ago. Man knocks on my front door in the middle of the night because my lights are on, he's bawling his eyes out asking to call 911. I call 911 and give him my phone and follow him to the park across the street where his girlfriend is dead and his friend is trying to resuscitate her. I ended up running to the nearby fire department to try and get some help and I was standing there talking to a firefighter in his underwear when the call came in for them to assist.  Her name was Iris McLachlane. I feel like I'm one of the only people who remembers her. [end]
[start] You did a great thing today, giving help and compassion to people in one of their worst times in life. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry you had to witness to that. I don’t know I could ever deal with something like that and come out okay after witnessing it, the interstate is so fucking dangerous.  I hope you’re doing okay. [end]
[start] Thank you.  Your heart is in the right place and you are totally right. [end]
[start] Giving you a hug. What a horrific thing to go through. My heart is breaking for the passenger girl’s family. [end]
[start] I know that sucks but just know the dead girl probably didn’t feel a thing. If that helps [end]
[start] You did good it’s hard seeing something like that but you didn’t stand around that’s worth more that you think [end]
[start] It is a good thing you put it into words, talk about it, hopefully find a counselor or a therapist to process it. Life is fragile, and mental health too. Take care. You did good going and helping. Thank you. [end]
[start] I’ve had this happen - first on scene at an accident and dead people. It’s gut wrenching. It makes you so thankful for being alive and then you feel bad for feeling good. And you can’t stop thinking about that poor person’s family and friends and what they must be going through. Did they die quickly or did they know what was happening?  All kinds of roller coaster emotions.   Hang in there!  It will be hard to get over and take a long time. Maybe try to talk to a counselor. [end]
[start] A lot of good advice in here. I just want to add a little trick I have learned over the years dealing with traumatic events: play tetris, or some similar puzzle type game. It helps you stop reliving the event in your head and can help prevent PTSD. Its also something to do when you are wide awake and shocked and dont know what to do. Hope it helps. [end]
[start] Take this as a learning experience.  You've seen some of the worst.  Seems like you all reacted well (good job!).  I try to take some mental notes for how to do better myself next time (keeping in mind you sound like you all did a great job on this one).  Also, use it as a tool for compassion for our EMS, PD, and FD responders who see this quite regularly.  The world looks a bit different today.  Digest, but do your best not to ruminate (repeating/replaying).  Snap your self out if you catch yourself doing it.  Seeking therapy isn't wrong or weak if it helps.  You all did right by these folks.  Hang on to that. [end]
[start] I’ve seen many wrecks in my day. My parents had this 40 mph curve right after a mile or so of straight away stretch. Needless to say, people liked to speed on that straight away and never expect that curve. Several helicopters have landed in my parents yard for air evacuations. One of the worst happened to be on the straight away though, directly in front of our home. One dude had a mustang, had illegal nitrous in it. From the grape vine these two guys were coming from a wedding, likely drinking, and decided they wanted to take on this straight stretch with exceptional speed. They passed someone and hit another guy head on. They were going so fast they stopped the other guy dead in his tracks, literally, his car veered off into the field across from their house, on fire. The mustang though, absolutely exploded and landed in the large field next to my parents house. Both fields were in flames. Two men involved died on impact, the passenger of the mustang was somehow still alive. They tried to air evac him but couldn’t land the helicopter as it was feeding the two VERY LARGE fires at this point. They eventually took him to another hospital... but not before we thought our home was done for. Another hours worth of fire fighting. I don’t know how it didn’t engulf our home, it came very close to our garage building. All three men eventually passed away. I was 15 and still remember the smell of burning flesh and trying to “save” someone. Scariest moment of my life thus far. [end]
[start] I witnessed one of the most gruesome accidents I have ever seen when I was about 9 years old. I won’t go into details about the accident, but I can say that that experience has stayed with me since. I can still remember the smell of a person’s perfume at the scene. That will forever bring me back to the scene! I’m 40 years old now and would advise seeing a therapist is this is something you’re unable to shake. I speak from experience. [end]
[start] So this is weird and stupid but studies have been shown that playing Tetris within the first 10 hours of a traumatic event can help alleviate ptsd symptoms. Just a thought.   Another thought: what you did was brave and incredible. Mortality is not easy to witness- especially regarding the young. Get both of you to a professional and remember that everybody processes grief and trauma very differently. Let each other process and trust in one another. You are so good. [end]
[start] Respect!  I stopped at a car wreck once, a lady rolled her vehicle over into a steep ditch in front of me. I still remember her being unconscious making gurgling sounds, blood all over her face, glass everywhere, etc. I’m not remotely medical, I get queasy around someone else’s injuries. I made a decision after that day to never stop again unless I was the only one there, in which I’d call 911 and stay in my vehicle. I’m no help around something like this, and probably a hindrance due to the obvious look of panic on my face. Maybe selfish but the trauma isn’t worth it to me. [end]
[start] Jesus fucking christ I'm so sorry you went through this, the poor girls.  Maybe ring the hospital or contact one of the parents, your going to need closure from such a horrific crash.  Thank you for being such a good samaritan xx [end]
[start] everytime i hear a story like this i remember to appreciate the family that i have, sorry u had to go through this OP, ur a great person for helping. [end]
[start] Thank you for being a helping hand to those girls. This is a horrible situation to live through. You and your boyfriend being there for protection and comfort is incredibly brave and kind. Take some time to recover from what happened and if the memories become too overwhelming please reach out to a counselor or a crisis support line. [end]
[start] You did a good thing.  First on scene at a fatal car crash is a horrific thing.  Please see if your local hospital or police department has a victim’s services program.  That might be one place for you to start. [end]
[start] There is a lot to process here. Just remember that what you did strikes to the core of humanity and speaks volumes about both of your characters. You and your boyfriend were there for complete strangers at a terrifying and life changing point.   Just know in your hearts that although you will likely never see the survivors again they will be eternally grateful for your compassion at their darkest hour.  My only hope is I come across humans like you two if I ever find myself in a similar situation. [end]
[start] > This also may be common knowledge for some, but for others, PLEASE, don't ride passenger in a car with your feet up on the dash. From what I saw, this is what killed her.    Yes, airbag + feet on dash = kneecap bullets. Cars are designed to keep you alive sitting in one position. Don't put your feet on the dash and wear your seat belt. [end]
[start] This is my second time hearing about not riding in the passenger side with your feet on the dash. On this site. I hope you find your peace🖤 [end]
[start] This happened to some friends and I over 30 years ago. She didnt die but she was in bad shape, face half covered in blood. Guy hit her at a 45 degree angle from head on and sent her car into the fence? Telephone pole? Luckily my friend was an emt and stopped the bleeding because she probably would not have made it waiting a few minutes for an ambulance.  Turns out she worked at the bar next to the taco stand we were at. I never once went in that bar except 5ish years later. Took one look at the bartender and asked her if she was in that crash. She was shocked I recognized her because she needed facial reconstruction. [end]
[start] I know how you feel. About two years ago, I was stopped at an intersection and witnessed a boy on a bike get hit by a small truck. He survived, but only just barely and only after 3ish months in the hospital. Definitely give yourself time to process what you saw. After two years, i can still remember where it happened, and some of the small moments, but the shocking sounds and smells are gone, as well as the direct image of the way the truck hit him. [end]
[start] Thank you for helping, you are good people!  I have been in that situation a few times, did a lot of first aid so happy to help out, and it is always weird afterwards.    Eat something, remember to stay hydrated and all the best [end]
[start] I'm so sorry that this has happened to you, it is beyond all shadow of a doubt a traumatic experience that you have endured and survived. I work in funeral service and death investigations and have the "lucky" aspect of not having to make time sensitive decisions and actions.  I would highly encourage you to reach out to your local health department for resources in processing and unpacking this experience, as the likelihood of developing ptsd is rather high when you witness these things.   Remember: Its okay to admit you're not okay and fuck anyone else who says otherwise. Take care of yourself, don't forget your basic needs and take it day by day. Please don't suffer in silence [end]
[start] Thank you for sharing.  I will be mindful to keep my feet off the dash from now on. [end]
[start] Talk about it to anyone who will listen. You have trauma and the best treatment within the first 30 days is to debrief. If you can also see a therapist at least once, that will help too. Sorry you went through this. [end]
[start] I was a first responder for many years. You do need to talk about what happened, if possible. You and your BF could talk about how shocked and afraid you were. Keep in mind the fact that *you were able to help people at their most vulnerable moment.* Recognize that it’s over now and you are both safe.  Sometimes a traumatic event sort of bursts our bubble. *Our illusion of safety is stripped away.* We feel afraid, or angry, or sad, or maybe all of them in varying amounts over time.   So talk to each other, or someone else, or both. It would be a really good idea to see a trauma counselor a couple of times so you can process what happened and move forward in a healthy way. You definitely don’t want to start into unhealthy thought pattern loops. See someone who deals with this a lot.  On occasion, you may have sudden feelings of panic and fear. Stay grounded in that moment. Recognize that this is a feeling. The feeling is temporary. Just let yourself feel it and breathe deeply until it passes. At least, that’s what works for me and I no longer fear those moments. The less I fear them, the less they occur. [end]
[start] This might sound ridiculous, but please spend 10 minutes playing any pattern-based games (like candy crush or tetris...). yes, I'm serious.  There is research that doing so within 24h after a traumatizing event prevents flash-backs which can haunt you for a while.  and even if it was bullshit, then you just lost 10 minutes to playing a game for distraction. [end]
[start] Riding with your feet on the dash is a good way to have your shinbones impale your chest in a wreck. Getting stabbed through the chest by your own leg isn't a good time. Ride safe. [end]
[start] My husband and I had a similar experience about a month ago. Right out front of our house. PM me if you just want to talk/process. A large part of me is still struggling to process what I saw that day, too.  Cry, laugh, call your family and tell them how much you love them, plan a spontaneous trip because you've realized just how fragile life can be. Do what your mind and body are calling for. Take care of yourself today. I'll be thinking of you. [end]
[start] Thank you for responding the way you did. When I was 5 my family was hit by a driver who had fallen asleep. I have vague memories that haunt me of the accident and aftermath--but one of the most important things was that people were there with us in the immediate moments after the crash before police and paramedics arrived. This was back in the 80s so no one had cell phones. I'm not sure how much time lapsed--I had mostly blacked out, but I remember being pulled from the car and then put into the ambulance. Others were there with my mom and sister, who were also badly injured. I know it was traumatic for you to witness, but please do know your presence might have meant a lot to the girls involved. And it's ok to be in shock, it's ok to take time to process this, and it might come back at you at various times (I get shaky when passing accident scenes still). Be gentle with yourself. [end]
[start] My dad broke his back from riding with his feet up on the dashboard. So I second that advice- don't do it.  The doctors told him he would never walk again. But he did and now he's a mailman! :D [end]
[start] I'm sorry you had to go through this, it's difficult. Thank you for what you did. I've also been in this situation. I came across a single vehicle collision last year on a lonely country road while I was working and found the driver deceased on the ground near his car. My adrenaline kicked in and I went into autopilot like you did. I did everything I was supposed to do, and after the scene was eventually under control, the local police highly recommended that I contact their victim's services department afterwards to talk to someone. I left work and went home immediately after and was emotionally numb and not myself for a couple of weeks. I even had a surprise birthday party three days later and did not enjoy it at all, despite trying to wear a happy face. I did contact and visit the victim's services department and openly spoke with a couple of their therapists. I felt that it helped me. Please reach out to a therapist even if you think you don't need it. I know everyone is different, but over time the situation got much easier and normalized for me. [end]
[start] Welcome to my job. At least not weekly but monthly with wrecks like this. Add to that a Pandemic and I got the recipe for getting burned out. Which is why I am leaving. I used to love my job, now I feel nothing. You did the right thing of not moving anyone and keeping the friend from seeing the dead body. It helps us a lot when a bystander calms the victims before we get there. You will be wired for a long time until the adrenaline wears off. Just know that this is a pretty normal occurrence daily around the world. It's shitty but that's what happens. It was completely out of your control and you did the best you could do. Take a mental health day and do something to decompress. Stay safe! [end]
[start] Contact the non urgent police line and explain what happened and they will arrange someone for you to talk to. [end]
[start] firstly, I'm so sorry that happened. I experienced a similar traumatic incident with my partner recently. writing everything out in as much detail as you can will help, so posting this was a good idea. doing this allowed me to see what my brain was subconsciously feeling during the time I was on autopilot, and it also helped me analyse the situation more clearly and gave me a healthier perspective with less blame and more acceptance. I would also recommend you both see a psychologist asap, the quicker you act the better the outlook. also it helps to tell friends, family etc what happened. don't feel like a broken record or anything it's important to get it off your chest, but also don't ruminate/dwell on it more than you have to. oh & let yourself cry/experience emotions or it will just bottle up and resurface later, and worse.    it's been almost two weeks now and I feel like the shock has almost entirely subsided and I don't think about it much anymore. I fully believe that getting help early was key.   im so sorry you experienced this, all the best. ♡♡ [end]
[start] That’s gotta be horrible to witness. I guess all I can say is that I hope it doesn’t affect you in a bad way and you did good calling 911 [end]
[start] Sending you guys love [end]
[start] You should turn your traumas into becoming frontline EMS or ER provider! [end]
[start] I'm sitting here crying in the dark at 12 AM. [end]
[start] It's difficult to come face to face with sudden death even if it's someone you don't know. It's even more difficult if you haven't come to grips with your own mortality yet. [end]
[start] Thank you for helping. You may feel wound up and a bit dazed or disconnected, have trouble sleeping, or have intrusive thoughts about the crash for a few days to a couple weeks. That is totally normal as your brain processes the experience and organizes your memories (just like more details got filled in on your post). Talk it out with your boyfriend or other sources of support. You are a good person for helping the women in the crash. [end]
[start] I was first on the scene after a bad car crash. Thank goodness for basic first aid as I knew what to do. It has stayed with me to this day, the sights, the feelings. [end]
[start] You and your boyfriend may want to look into therapy. Especially it sticks with you for a while. Thats very traumatic event and images. I hope you can find peace that you helped with what you could.  The world needs more people like you and your boyfriend. [end]
[start] You and your boyfriend are so brave to go out there and help these young girls. I can't imagine how traumatized both the girls will be when they heard the news about their friend.   You get taught about it in school about the safeties of driving etc. One driving safety videos they showed was pretty graphic even though it wasn't real, I kept picturing in my mind I was at the wheel and I caused the crash and my friend next to me was dead. I almost had to leave the room as I felt sick thinking about the scenario in my head. Never notice how import those videos are until you end up in that kind of situation. But please everyone, drive safely too! [end]
[start] Reading this post made me think of the accident that occurred on a highway in California earlier today. An intoxicated driver was traveling eastbound on a westbound freeway and collided with a car carrying 5 passengers. The passenger of the car traveling westbound was killed instantly and the intoxicated driver was arrested. The victim was only 18 years old. [end]
[start] Please seek therapy if you can. Im sorry this happen to the girls and you and your boyfriend cause its a terrible tragedy. PTSD is no joke i do hope you and your boyfriend and the others in crash feel better and seek help because that is an serious accident. [end]
[start] I’m someone who puts their foot on the dash. Thanks for the advise, sorry u had to go through this:( [end]
[start] ❤️ [end]
[start] I've been there. Our neighbor was killed on his motorcycle on our quiet street. We were one of the first to run out. His body was so broken but he wasn't gone yet. We couldn't do anything but call for help and divert traffic around him while he died. Please OP, get counseling ASAP. We didn't, and years later it still haunts us. Life is so short and unpredictable. You did the right thing by helping, now do the right thing for you and your boyfriend and get help for this traumatic experience. Hugs. [end]
[start] Hi, I helped someone once in a very traumatic car accident. It was a mess, lots of blood and I’ll never forget the screaming. Even if you think your okay be sure to talk to a professional. Shit will mess ya up. [end]
[start] I saw a deadly accident happen almost a year to the date..first alive..hit by 18 wheeler then no longer alive. I saw the impact the body get thrown  and hit passenger window then the bloody door immediately after. I went bonkers for a bit even though I was by myself. I could not get the whole vision out my head..playing over and over from happy blue skies to havoc. I believe accidents not only hurt the victims..but the also those who witness it. Still today..I'm especially cautious at  intersection. Let's stay safe to protect ourselves and others from trauma. It's real. [end]
[start] Out of pure morbid fascination, I'd really like to find out the details of how and why the crash happened.  On a more relevant note, as a fellow human being I am proud of you two for responding and doing what you could to help out.  Whether or not you want attention, you deserve it.  Do what you can to get therapy though.  That kind of stuff can really mess with a person's head. [end]
[start] Ok who tf put the wholesome award on this post how sick are you [end]
[start] If you find out that any one of you have ptsd please listen to this   Do EMDR therapy its the best way to get rid of ptsd Lets just say that my familiy has a lot of experience  On EMDR and PTSD   Stay save and good luck [end]
[start] You both are in shock now but it will wear off.  Please consider getting some support for the trauma you have endured? [end]
[start] Whoever gave this a wholesome award is an asshole [end]
[start] Please make an appointment with a therapist this week. Even if you feel fine, it will be good for you to talk to someone about this. [end]
[start] wow. my condolences to well everyone who experienced this [end]
[start] You're both good people. Just think how many others heard that and did absolutely nothing. I know that won't remove the memories but, please try to hang onto the fact that that girl will remember and be thankful for what you did for her.  Sending love and hugs xx [end]
[start] I don’t think I could say much to help you, but take it easy on yourself. You did an amazing thing by helping - a lot of people would have just watched and not taken action. Well done for trusting your instincts and being there and doing something to help. And definitely go talk to some professionals about dealing with it, that’s a huge thing to take on emotionally. [end]
[start] this scene happens multiple times a day within the "greatest country in the world" and instead of realizing technologies in automated transportation, or at the very least computer aided systems like lane assist or rear collision prevention, couldve saved this group of young and promising girls prevented op and first responders from seeing wasted life. [end]
[start] It's completely understandable you need to talk about it. What a traumatic experience to be involved in. Look after yourself, take it easy. Find someone to talk to about it. You are a great person, to be jumping in and helping. You did an amazing thing. Be proud of yourself. We are. [end]
[start] my prayers are with u and I hope you get some professional help. The idea of Tetris is not bad either (as per other posters) [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Wow... im in tears. No wonder you are in schock. Anyone who would be in such a situation would be. You handled it very well. I hope this doesnt haunt you in your dreams. And if it does, please talk to people, weather it is your boyfriend, family or terapist. Must have been so traumatic. 🥺💔 You have no idea how much you must have helped the women whom you held. Both in the moment of a comfort/safe person. That she wasnt alone. And that you saved her from seeing her dead friend. Don’t think that image would ever leave her mind. You so quickly acted. I think most would freeze up in shock. [end]
[start] Possibly PTSD/anxiety might be a very slow creeper creeping up on you. You’re going to need to pay attention to your thoughts and learn how to recognize it when you go into that state.  Ie: every time you get in the car you get a flash back. While sitting in the car you’re constantly worried about getting into a accident. When you get to therapy look for someone who specializes in PTSD/anxiety. Constant stress from that causes a bunch of different issues. Good luck. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry you and your boyfriend went through that, I hope you both find peace of mind soon.  Talk with a professional as well. [end]
[start] I've never been involved in any kind of scene where somebody just died so horribly. I hope I don't have to, but hope that this has at least made you stronger in the end.  I know some people might not like me saying that, but in truth, you should soak up anything positive out of anything that happens no matter how bad, so that the foundations of our l past is built on as much strength as it can, never just weakness built from scars. [end]

[start]  "3-4 hours ago my boyfriend and I were laying down to go to bed when we heard a loud horrific crash."   "My boyfriend and I drove home, the police and ambulance had arrived and had things under control. Once home"  &#x200B;  You're already at home... You drove 5 feet to your house??? What am I missing [end]
[start] You're awesome for helping. Death is not just natural but the most important event of life, if something be sure to dress nicely when your name be called [end]
[start] drunk driving kills [end]
[start] living so near by highway lol [end]
[start] This sounds more like a lucid dream. Like something OP imagined as she slept next an interstate. Who drives to the other side of the highway anyway? Every day could be your last, so live it to the full. [end]

[TITLE] I know my girlfriend’s reddit account and from time to time I anonymously give her those little Reddit awards on a post/comment she made. [TITLE]
[start] I'd do this to my girlfriend but I cant afford awards and I dont have a girlfriend [end]
[start] 💙💙💙💙💙💙 [end]
[start] That’s cute! [end]
[start] Dat shit cute [end]
[start] I’ve seen a post just like this one before. Glad to see more than one people are looking out for those they care about. [end]
[start] that is super cute [end]
[start] My girlfriend does this to me! She likes to check in on how I'm doing sometimes and its heartwarming  Edit: Thanks sabrina! [end]
[start] Everyone likes that 👍👍 [end]
[start] My girlfriend ran off with my best friend, and I miss him. [end]
[start] Try making her cheat on you with you [end]
[start] that is so cute 😪✨ [end]
[start] This is cute and all but- did she mean to be anonymous? Like does she know you know her reddit, and that you have reddit yourself but you are just giving her awards anonymously?  If it's the latter it's very cute, if it's the first it's like reading a diary.  Edit: its confirmed cute [end]
[start] I do this for my girlfriend too. My wife is not happy about it [end]
[start] I just wanna thank you for not posting this on r/confessions... i see too many of these posts over there and they fit this sub much better! [end]
[start] I did something like this once.  It did not turn out well. [end]
[start] Honestly if I found out my bf was doing the same I would be kind of irritated... like ooh a nice ego boost and then ope, nope. [end]
[start] Very sweet! Its shame my wife doesn't use reddit at all [end]
[start] Little do you know she prolly does the same thing to u from her other boyfriends account [end]
[start] This is so wholesome 🥺 [end]
[start] Wholesome post of the day. [end]
[start] That’s so sweet aw [end]
[start] That's so sweet [end]

[start] Are you the one giving everyone in the comments an award? You’re an MVP dude, though - stop wasting money on reddit [end]
[start] Thats wholesome right here if i only have both [end]
[start] Wait that’s so cute 🥺 [end]
[start] Wish my boyfriend would do this for me [end]
[start] Imma start doing this to my husband. [end]

[start] Omg this is so adorable! [end]
[start] What a nice thing to do [end]
[start] This is just the sweetest. [end]
[start] That is so sweet! [end]
[start] What’s an award? 🤔 [end]
[start] To be honest that’s really adorable :)) [end]
[start] I hope she comments on this and you have yet another opportunity to give her an award. [end]
[start] Everyone’s getting awards [end]
[start] And in the meantime, I have never gotten an award.. 😔 [end]
[start] Wow that's so cuuute ✨ [end]
[start] I wish my girl friend had a Reddit account so I could do that, that’s adorable [end]
[start] This made my gloomy day a little brighter. [end]
[start] If she ever finds out you know she's gonna be pissed of bcs of all the built ego and then the downfall....  but seriously tho youre a legend 💜💜💜 [end]
[start] I once tried to ‘make it big’ on YouTube and my now husband made fake accounts to like all my videos and comment on them just to make me happy when I thought I had fans😂. So please keep doing what you’re doing because it’s so sweet ❤️❤️❤️❤️ [end]
[start] So cute! I wish I had a boyfriend who would do that. [end]
[start] Boyfriends everywhere thank you for this post. [end]
[start] plot twist : she knows *your* reddit account and is one of the people who gave you gold on this post [end]
[start] This sounds good but is actually bad. Reddit should be and stay anonymous. [end]
[start] I'm getting stalker vibes, sorry. That's really cute if she's ok with you reading all her posts and comments. I personally wouldn't be comfortable with that, but it's me, I understand people are different. [end]
[start] I'm not crying, you're crying.... [end]
[start] That's incredibly gay [end]
[start] PLAY YA YA DING DONG! [end]
[start] You promote false self confidence in her in turn making us all be required to take note of her inferrior posts to truly anonymized rewarded postamathinger peoples [end]
[start] Dude, that's kinda fucked if you think about it .  What if shit goes sour and she secretly had YOUR info. [end]
[TITLE] I was accused of sexually assaulting a minor [TITLE]
[start] Makes me wonder what she told the cops? Did she tell them the same story? Because they would definitely want details if she was reporting a sexual assault. [end]
[start] That's incredibly messed up dude, did your nephew talk to her? I'd love to hear her justification for it [end]
[start] Jesus what an absolute lunatic.  [end]
[start] This is so messed up, dude. I'm sorry you went through this. I wonder if she actually considered the hug sexual assault or she just felt like trying to ruin your life. [end]
[start] My ex wife accused me of raping her.  Heres the thing I wasnt even in the same country as her when she said it happened. She didnt know I had already left the country. She was mad cause I was refusing to pay her phone bill. [end]

[start] Hey, for future reference, do not speak to the police without a lawyer, regardless of how positive you are of your innocence. There is nothing you can say that will help, and literally anything you say can be used against you. [Check this out when you have the time](https://youtu.be/d-7o9xYp7eE) [end]
[start] If they come back, don’t talk , get a lawyer  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] We live in perilous times.  I am a former teacher and I remember going to class on the proper way to "hug a student".  These were the Mary J. Letourneau days.  I have been to sexual harassment seminars and one in particular, where the speaker, an attorney once said "If a co-worker falls down a flight of stairs, call 911 but don't touch them.  No, buts, just don't touch them".  Finally, I have two relatives who are detectives and they say the same thing.  If they aren't your kids: Just shake hands, High Five, One Arm Side Hugs and all in a room full of people.  They investigate sexual harassment claims all the time.   [end]
[start] next time don't EVER speak to a police officer without a lawyer present... ever.  Their job is to collect evidence against you.   Also, I'm a 41 year old man, I work with younger girls who like to hug... I tell people "I'm a bubble person, I don't hug, stay the fuck outa my bubble", specifically to avoid the kinda crap you;re going through.  This isn't some result of #meetoo, it's the realization that I only have 1 reputation, and it doesn't take much to ruin that. All it takes (as you've almost just learned) is one pissed of woman to ruin your life... my dad gave me that advice over 25 years ago, and it's served me well.    [end]
[start] This is insane. If she literally told the cops 'he hugged me hello and I didnt like it' are they required to continue to follow up? It's so clearly not sexual assault. [end]
[start] Im a criminology major, from my understanding of the situation there is absolutly no level of sexual assualt committed. It is part of our culture to welcome family and associated friends to hug and say hello as a way of welcoming. What puzzles me is why it took 6 months to make such accusations. If this had gone to court it would fall through very quickly.  You are correct in that the police had a duty to investigate. But it can be damaging when false accusations such as this are made, especially sexual assualt allegations being a highly discouraged crime. If you know you did nothing wrong the truth is that. However try not to get caught up on what could have been just focus on whats going on.   I dont think the police will follow up as they already know its a waste of important police efforts. Im very sorry to hear this kinda thing happened, keep on keeping on my friend and dont let this get you down. This gril sounds as if she might have something else troubling her in her life to accuse someone hugging as sexual assualt, kinda laughable in my opinion and i think the police are thinking the same thing. [end]
[start] [NEVER TALK TO THE COPS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE)  You got off lucky. Maybe. Or maybe tomorrow they arrest you based on what you said after running it by the DA. [end]
[start] I'm glad it all worked out for you. But you should never speak to the police without an attorney if accused of a crime. [end]
[start] I'm really sorry that happened to you. I personally don't like hugs from strangers or distant relatives I'm not close to but they usually reach out for one and I just do it. Never would occur to me to accuse anyone of sexual assault in such cases, except if they would actually try something more. [end]
[start] What happens when they show up to your work you ask?  You lose your job.  Happened to me in the military, girl was failing out of aircrew school, we hung out together at a different training school almost 1.5 years before. Office of Special Investigations investigates for 8 months. During that time, I'm grounded, lose all qualifications, miss my timelines to become fully mission qualified.  OSI doesnt recommend charges and finds no evidence via multiple witness statements, physical evidence, the fact that she couldn't recall or bother to look up when the class occurred in order to tell them when it happened etc.  Am moved out of my office and into a janitors closet and am told I am being found unfit for duty due to the missed qualifications due to being grounded, told that prosecution is still pushing charges (because in the military, the only proof required for a article 32 (grand jury hearing) is an accusation from the victim.  Used to be married, with a home and two cars, making close to 60ish k a year.  Now work as a laborer for a supply company making less than 40k as a single dad.  It's not all bad, just very difficult as a single dad of three with sole custody and little income. No longer homeless (mostly), just bought a more reliable vehicle, starting to climb the ladder again. [end]
[start] I think accusing someone wrongly on purpose should be punished as hard as actual assauld. Both destoy lives. I am a woman myself..  [end]
[start] Seriously the same thing happened to my boyfriend but he actually got charged as having "intent" and he had no such thing in mind! Girls can say anything and most times can really hurt someone's reputation and destroy their life! I'm sorry!  [end]
[start] Report her to the prosecutors office for making false statements.   [end]
[start] There should be punishment for doing that.   Also, 17 y.o. that both doesn't likes hugs AND can casually call sexual offense? That's tough to imagine. Always felt that detest for contact was part of whole anxiety/depression thingy. And those kind of people don't call cops. [end]
[start] Handshakes only for me.  [end]
[start] My daughter did play softball. Is now a college head coach in fact. I used to coach baseball and softball but I gave it up for fear that some innocent action of mine could be (perhaps even intentionally) misconstrued as something sinister and I would have my life ruined.  So I gave up doing something I loved because you cannot be to careful these days.  Leave coaching girls and young women to the women.    [end]
[start] Interesting story, and I personally try to never have physical contact other than shaking hands with people I don't know. [end]
[start] I would advise you to delete this post and not make any statements to anyone, but a lawyer about the specifics.  Never assume the cops are being honest with you. Don't talk to them without a lawyer present.   Although,  you think you are defending yourself,  you are actually giving them information to use against you.  [end]
[start] Should be a lesson for your nephew too - how much can go wrong if you're casual with other peoples personal information, even when you have no reason to think anything of it. [end]
[start] Relax man, they know. They just have to follow procedure. Forget about the silly child and move on, don't dwell on it for a second.  [end]
[start] Welcome to a very small glance at the world of your average divorced dad in 2018.  Destroys lives it does (not just the falsely accused, but also their families/friends).  There are no consequences to the accusers.    Source:  haven’t seen my 4 year old son due to custody battle false accusations from a diagnosed sociopath.    Fuck our judicial system.   [end]
[start] Huh... interesting. I’m ready for downvotes, but aren’t we taking an person accusation of a false accusation at face value?  If it happened, it’s awful and I’m glad it worked out, but I’ve been noticing a trend of immediately believing such accusations. Of which we have nothing but their word that it’s true. Which is ironic considering the Reddit belief that we shouldn’t take things at face value when it comes to sexual assault accusations.  Especially since this one person account is less than a day old, how can we be sure he’s even real?   [end]
[start] And people were saying the other day how “stupid” Wall Street men were for avoiding 1 on 1 situations with women, particularly young beautiful women. This is the world that we live in, protect yourselves, men  [end]
[start] One of Al Franken's accusers was a woman who said that he put his hand on her waist when they posed for a photo together. The #metoo movement is good and important but there are problems that need to be addressed. Things can get taken too far, things that are not sexual assault that are treated as such, and although it's a small minority, some women do make false allegations. It's important for us to be able to be open and honest about this instead of just taking it too far in the right direction that it passes into the wrong direction.  [end]
[start] I was talking with one of my professors who I was really close with after I was sexually assaulted by my "friend". It wasn't anything like super terrible that happened so I was feeling really stuck on what to do, if I should report it and all that jazz. Anyways he said to me that literally any unwanted touching could be considered sexual assault, he touched my arm and he was like "if you really wanted to, you could report that as sexual assault". It's a little ridiculous if you ask me but I can kind of see both sides of it if that makes sense? Like I wouldn't classify what you did as sexual assault but it could be taken that way, if that makes sense [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] This kind of women/ladies destroy the movement itself. This is why when sexual assault are not taken seriously. If you want to take revenge, do it the other way girl. Self reflect, be a better you. Thats the best  revenge you can give.  [end]
[start] I feel for men in these days, seriously, if I was a man I would be so scared to even look at girls.    No longer being able to hugs girls or bounce them on your knee without seeming like a predator.     The lack of attention from men will eventually make girls so skittish they will be crying rape if a men, God forbid, holds a door open for them.     [end]
[start] This is why the MeToo movement is somewhat dangerous. Before people start downvoting me to hell: I believe the MeToo movement has good intentions. However it has created an environment in which any woman can accuse any man of sexual assault and ruin that man’s life, whether or not the accusation is true. It allows idiots like this girl to take advantage of the social stigma regarding sexual assault accusations and it is creating a lot of fear, which is not being shown as much in the media because it’s not pc to be afraid of being accused of sexual assault. If you did nothing wrong, you have nothing to be afraid of right? Wrong. You can lose your career, your family, your reputation, and more just from a accusation, and those things cannot be repaired even after you’re proven not guilty.     [end]
[start] It's a shame that we live in a society where you can get your life ruined over a polite hug.  Thanks feminism.  Now downvote me to hell [end]
[start] I'm sorry that this happened to you.  False or overblown reports to the police are rare, but they do happen. :(  > And jeez... sexual assault? Do those words really have the clout they should? That they used to?  >  Unwanted hug, sexual assault. Dragged into the bushes and forcibly raped, sexual assault. Cat-called from across the street, sexual assault.  Here's where we disagree.  An unwanted hug can be sexual assault.  If you knew the girl and she'd told you she wasn't comfortable with hugs and you kept doing it, that definitely can be sexual assault.  Is it rape?  No.  Is it as bad as rape?  No.  But that's why we don't call it rape.  We have different types of sexual assault, and we have them for a reason.  In your case, it's not reasonable to expect that you would know that she doesn't like to be hugged.  It's also upon her to extend her hand for a handshake if you go in for a hug that she doesn't want, or to turn away, or to tell you that she doesn't like hugs, or whatever.    Again, sorry that this happened, and I' glad it sounds like it's all going to work out for you. [end]
[start] I think the law enforcement institutions in this country used to have some fucked up ideas about sexual assault - that husbands couldn't rape their wives, that "boys will be boys," etc etc. That attitude protected folks like Weinstein, Rose, Moonves, etc etc - and they knew it was wrong.  Now the line has moved and everyone is still figuring it out. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. On the other hand, if you had actually been a horrible asshole to her (like felt up her ass or something during the hug), I'd be glad the cops were visiting. It sucks we have no better way to discern these things. [end]
[start] This is a classic case of fuck she wasn't 18 [end]
[start] If the shoe fits, wear it.  [end]
[start] She must be fucked in the head if she wants to start and investigation SIX MONTHS after an innocent hug. [end]
[start] r/legaladvice would tell you to get a lawyer. Please do so. [end]
[start] Never hug a stranger. Handshakes are for a reason. I'm sorry for what you've been through.  [end]
[start] You could drag her to court for false allegations.  [end]
[start] Anyone who goes to that length over a hug needs a therapist or something, wtf?! I’m not a hugger but I’m not about to ruin a mans life over it, fuck that. [end]
[start] Every mans worst nightmare since this metoo bullshit. Glad it worked out for you without to much trouble [end]
[start] “No more hugs” that makes me sad. Not the world we should be living in.  [end]
[start] People that falsely report sexual assault is why the real victims are laughed at and turned away. She’s messed up in the head.  [end]
[start] my grandfather (87) has mild dementia and lives in a retirement residence.  back story: apparently a couple months earlier another resident walked into his apartment and yelled at him to get out of her apartment. She lived 2 floors up. After he explained and showed her it was his unit,  and he put his arm around her shoulder to reassure her it was okay. Fast forward, another older woman was walking down the hall and lost her balance near my grandfather and another man. Grandfather reached out to prevent her falling, she immediately yelled at him for touching him inappropriately. A staff member came around the corner as she told him to let go. Staff member interceded, result police were called and woman wanted him charged with sexual assault (apparently when he reached out to stop her falling he may have brushed her breast).  Cops said it wasn't but talked to grandfather suggesting he stays away from the ladies. It didn't matter that the other man was there and saw the whole thing...this was the 2nd accusation. We had until the end of day to remove him from the facility. To add insult to injury, because we didn't give 2 months notice they expected 2 months rent. My parents were out of country at the time and another relative took care of this, luckily finding another retirement home for him (told them what happened).   My parents were furious and wanted to demand the money back and get a written apology since this shouldn't have happened but grandfather just wanted to put it behind him. Prior to this, he had a friend in the other unit and spent a lot of time with him, socializing. Now he only leaves his room for solitary meals because he doesn't want to be forced to move again. [end]
[start] OP this all is wack. You didn’t do anything wrong, although as you stated things have changed in the world. Thank you for posting in such a well written manner. Please update if anything else happens! [end]
[start] Do you normally hug people when you meet for the first time? [end]
[start] /r/thathappened [end]
[start] I don’t believe you, this is just your shower thought experiment—you gave it a narrative for impact.  [end]
[start] There's so many opportunists and con artists that it harms actual victims. She needs to be brought to charges for filing a false claim, if nothing else. [end]
[start] I think women are abusing the fact that disrespecting them is considered sexist taking it too far [end]
[start] The fact that there are no consequences for false accusations infuriates me.  [end]
[start] Bullshit anti-MeToo fanfic, and a poorly disguised one at that.    [end]
[start] You need to stop worrying about the lying cunt, and start worrying about protecting yourself and your livelihood, for your family's sake.  Contact a lawyer, explain your situation and ask for legal advice, such as if you need to file a criminal complaint, or a civil suit for defamation of character, or whatever else.  You should also inquire about getting a restraining order against her, she shouldn't be allowed near you or your loved ones ever again.  If you don't deal with this decisively and on paper for the record, your whole life can be destroyed over this, and impoverish your family.  Don't let it happen.   [end]
[start] Being 19 myself I see so many teen girls now that will do anything to scream sexual assault. It’s so sad and also being someone that’s experienced genuine sexual assault it takes away a lot from that.  I understand she doesn’t like hugs but I’m sorry that doesn’t take away from the 26 year old who assaulted me when I was 15...    I’m so sorry this happened to you, and honestly I hope it blows up in her face. She could have ruined your life saying shit like that.  [end]
[start] I agree with "where there's smoke there's a fire" but sounds like she's a pyro.  Don't know the WHOLE story but sounds like there was nothing illicit happening.  Best of luck with the overreacting accusations tho.  [end]
[start] This honestly sounds like a crazy person. I’m so sorry this happened to you!   Women like this do as big of a disservice to actual abuse survivors.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I'm sorry but this well written, politically charged story about smells a bit fake. Throw away profile. First sub its posted to is /r/twoxchromosomes. Why? It strikes me as too similar to the one a few weeks ago with the guy with an incel son.  And finally, if the girl reported "this guy sexually assaulted me", the first ask her a lot more questions: what exactly did this man do? If she tells the truth ("he hugged me"), they wouldn't interview op. If she lies ("he groped me, raped me, etc) they ask who was around. What was the situation. And then they sure has hell push harder on op.  [end]
[start] She should be prosecuted to some extent. If you claim something and it isn't true, you should be held accountable.  It's completely frightening that someone can say one thing and almost ruin someone's life.  And let's be honest, the majority of the accused are men.   Even if found innocent, in the wrong environment (Like OP says, could have been at work), his life could have been ruined. [end]
[start] So messed up on how much the scale can shift with such a dramatic difference in punishment. People that do this should be punished themselves. She put your entire life on the line, over a hug... The outcome for something like this (if this was true) would rightfully be you go to jail, your name, career, life would be ruined. Now her, what’s the worst that’s gonna happen, She gets a slap on the wrist for lying, goes back to her life like nothing happened cause it didn’t an that’s it?  [end]
[start] Your nephew needs to prepare to get hit with a false accusation as well. Tell him if the cops come by, shut up and get a lawyer. He may want to contact a lawyer now to prepare. [end]
[start] This right here is nightmare fuel. [end]
[start] sounds like the girl found some new feminist friends. [end]
[start] Welcome to 2018, baby :) [end]
[start] This kind of thing definitely changes how you view other accusations, I know first hand.    [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] This is what we get with rampant left wing hysteria driven by propaganda.  [end]
[start]  AFAIK? a fake? This seems like a shill [end]
[start] Things like this muddy the waters for people who are ACTUALLY victims of sexual assault. It's unfortunate that someone who doesn't like to be hugged can accuse an innocent man of sexual assault and potentially ruin his life. I have friends who don't like being hugged and if someone comes in for a hug they politely back away and explain they do not like hugs. In this day and age it helps to ask first if you can give a hug. I know this thought didn't cross OP's mind, but it serves as a lesson for all. I feel deeply for anyone who has actually been a victim of sexual assault or violent groping, and I understand that some people don't like being hugged. I hope that nothing more comes of this for OP's sake. [end]
[start] Never talk to the cops, if they need to investigate don't help, let them do their job. [end]
[start] No denying that women have had the shitty end of the stick for thousands of years, in most cultures apart from the ocassional Boudicia/Amazonian flourish of greatness.  For women to falsely claim sexual impropriety against an innocent man is a travesty to the cause of womanhood and it upsets me greatly.  Especially when directed at an innocent and decent man, an ally to women.  Boys and girls get carried away especially in puberty, and certainly boundary lines need to be drawn.  But there are tragic parallels happening that hurt men and women. Don’t let them divide us.  I’m happy to assume your innocence.  The guilty would not have been able to articulate their feelings like you have. [end]
[start] you confessed to the crime to the police. next time, don’t EVER talk to the police, even if you are innocent. you cannot talk the police out of arresting you.  [end]
[start] That Girl should go to prison for trying to ruin other People’s lifes.  The World is fucked up  [end]
[start] And why exactly did you hug her? You should've just wave your hand. [end]
[start] . [end]
[start] Unpopular opinion here: But you can blame the schools and colleges for this bullshit. They push this rape and sexual assault narrative so hard that I beleive it legitimately damages them. [end]
[start] I don't even look at women the wrong way let alone touch them for fear of this same exact situation.   So glad I'm married & not dating. Couldn't even imagine needing written, recorded & photo consent to even touch someone. That's what I would do before any physical contact is made because women are going to extremes now with this ignorant shit.   Hopefully for your sake this is over & doesn't end up haunting you. It's her word against yours & that is scary. Good luck!  [end]
[start] The result of This type of climate is that men will start avoiding normal social interactions with women. Like OP said, the accusation is enough to be judged by your surroundings:/ [end]
[start] Jesus. So sorry you had to go through this OP. I can’t stand this new liberal culture. As a man you have to walk around in a fear bubble.  [end]
[start] Thanks to the Proglodytes' weaponization of "feminism" (sic) you can expect a lot more of this.  Perhaps we should refer this to the court of public opinion at /r/politics. I'm sure you'd get a more than fair hearing there. (As long as you can show proof that you voted for the *right* candidate in 2016 anyway).  Maybe the whole "believe women" bullshit is just that: bullshit.   [end]
[start] Why hug someone you don't know at all? [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I consider myself also a very respectful dude. While I was younger I was a hugger. Like a big hugger, throw handshakes out the door guys girls whatever.  I'm still a pretty open and lovey dude. Just not physically. Maybe because I want to avoid anyone even having the opportunity to "tattle" to my wife about anything to be annoying. But I work as a server on the weekend with a plethora of attractive young ladies. Everyone is super huggy and lovey there. It's a great environment. But I never initiate a hug, my go to is a lil fist bump unless I get a "what no hug?". Just to avoid any possible confusion or mix up. It's unfortunate.  [end]
[start] Out of curiosity did she hug you back? Was it an awkward hug? [end]
[start] You should have definitely asked the cops for the details first. Since you're getting accused of a serious crime, you have the right to know what you're getting accused for and HOW. From there you can tell your side of the story very carefully  [end]
[start] 2018, folks.  It's only gonna get weirder. [end]
[start] I feel as if this post was not in your best interest. Don't open your mouth about anything when the laws eyes are on you. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry to hear your story. I hate to say it,  but welcome to the future - it’s not very nice.... [end]
[start] As others have stated. I am wondering what she told the police. Talk to a lawyer if you can get that report from the police,and see if she said anything actionable.   I'm sorry you are having to go through this.  [end]
[start] " I have to think ..."  Let's be clear in regard to an entire situation where clarity should be sought.  You don't have to think that. You choose to think that.   [end]
[start] And, you have a few nut jobs that simply like a little "Oh-look what happened to ME" moments, if they feel their life is deserving strokes like that. [end]
[start] I wish you didn't decide no more hugs.  There is no way to go through life so that nobody ever feels uncomfortable. What makes people uncomfortable is basically an infinite range.  Of course it's up to you to decide when to initiate hugs or not, but from the sound of it you are already quite careful.  You should be mindful, considerate etc. In this scenario it does seem that nothing bad happened.  The world would be a better place if there was more hugging and human contact without fear. By being afraid of hugs you don't do good, perhaps you even do bad.  Life isn't black and white and you can never remove all risk.  Sorry this happened to you, I get it is scary.  Maybe you will be more nervous for a whole but try to stay open minded and don't shun human interaction where it can be a beautiful thing. [end]
[start] If the story is as you say this woman probably has a very messed up history.  [end]
[start] So was this all just a precursor to sue you or something? I don't understand what she thought would happen. Did she also report the likely hundreds of other minor acquaintances that have higher her in the past few years? [end]
[start] My dad has played music for awana's and even was a commander for his old church for about 30 years now its a week night church thing where kids play games and memorize verses. Kids would run up to him when they saw him and give him hugs thats it at our old church about 12 years ago since then we have moved 2 times and are at a new church. He doesn't dare hug kids cause hes terrified of getting sued and getting accused of being a sexual predator. Worst part is my dad loves kids he has been helping in children ministries since he was about 12 and hes 63 now. The man taught Bible studies and had great relationships with elementary school kids to highschool kids. He said that with how sue happy america and sexual assault and harassment is now hes almost thinking of stopping cause there are some at risk kids in the program who don't have dads, but he cant show them any sort of love or affection cause if he does lawsuits. Can and do occur.      &#x200B; [end]
[start] It's 2018, unless you have a prior relationship in some capacity with the female. Don't eveeeeeen man. I realize that the majority of women legitimately have a grievance and fought hard to be hard. But as any struggle in history there's going to be people who abuse that fight. Some people just wanna be a victim  [end]
[start] I feel for you. Something way less severe happened to me (no police) but roughly the same weird situation. Went with my girlfriend to meet some of her old college friends a couple hours away from where we live. As I was introduced to them, I shook the guys hands and hugged the girls. I'm not a big hugger but if my girlfriend hugs someone then introduces me, I usually hug them too. One of these girls was a little sister (16 or 17 years old) of one of my girlfriend's friends. Fast forward to that night and i'm approached by one of her male friends who is getting very aggressive with me asking me what I did to (little sisters name). I was very confused. My girlfriend and another one of her friends were also very confused as they're holding this guy back who is trying to get in my face. After he calms down I tell him I have no idea what he's talking about. He must be confusing me for someone else. He calls the little sister and she says I touched her inappropriately. Thankfully a bunch of the people there witnessed what she was talking about and said 'he just gave her a hug, man.' The girls also came to my defense saying 'he hugged me too, what's the big deal?' The whole night I kept getting weird vibes from everyone who didn't witness the hug. It was crazy to see first hand how being accused of something can instantly make others turn on you even after hearing that the girl was exaggerating and taking something as small as a hug and turning it into a very serious issue. I don't go in for hugs anymore. About a week later my girlfriend messaged the little sister on facebook and asked why she felt violated, we were both curious. She just responded with "I don't like hugs. He should really ask people if they're comfortable with him invading their private space. Please do not message me again." I totally understand where she's coming from but she saw me hug the previous 5 girls, my girlfriend hugged her, she had to know it was coming? Anyway, crazy world we live in today.  [end]
[start] You WIFE should file Charges on her for hugging her back. [end]
[start] This ain't that deep, OP. Cops are required to investigate the complaint because it involved a minor. They investigated, you told the truth, that's the end of it. It's not a sign of societal collapse or whatever. [end]
[start] me too bandwagon, very easy for people to get caught up in a movement and get carried away. I understand wanting to be part of an important issue, but you still need to use some common sense before throwing around wild accusations.  [end]
[start] I'm glad you didn't suffer damage but you definitely could have if they came to your job. The present climate is a bit over reactionary. People do have agendas and sometimes innocent people get hurt with false accusations.  [end]
[start] Does she also sue her Hairdresser for putting on the Cape and accidentally brushing her shoulder before cutting her hair? This is kinda ridiculous. I mean, sure if you don't wanna be hugged that's fine, tell people before they hug you, there's a million ways to show people that you don't want to be hugged OTHER THAN calling the cops on them half a year later. Hope this all turns out well for you OP [end]
[start] I know it has been said before, and I'm so glad that it did not bite you, but never say anything to cops under any circumstances, ever, for any reason. Do not do it.  The Miranda warning states "Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law." The corollary is that it cannot be used to help your case. Here's an example off the top of my head:  Case goes to trial, she says you touched her inappropriately and said inappropriate things to her. Cop who asked initially talked to you says "he claimed he never said a word to her." Now it doesn't matter if you said that - it is just the officer's recollection of a conversation that happened 6 months ago. But now it is 2 accounts vs. your 1 account saying you are not guilty, and this can make it look like you lied to the cops and are hiding something.  If you say nothing, invoke your 5th amendment rights, and lawyer up, then all they have is her saying something happened. There's nothing for them to misunderstand, misremember, or use against you. This is a good thing.  Cops are not your friends. Their job is to arrest and charge people with crimes. If you get a cop with an agenda looking to make an example out of every sexual assault case that comes across their desk, then you could be in for a long, painful legal battle. Do not give them any ammunition. They can and will use it.  It doesn't matter if you are innocent. It doesn't matter if nothing happened. It doesn't matter if you have never committed a crime in your life. Talking to the cops can only hurt you. Lawyer up, do not answer any questions (not even a yes or no, not even a nod), and let the lawyers handle this. [end]
[start] Dang man, sorry to hear. Your Nephew must really have that strong arm reach! :P [end]
[start] About your edit, don't assume that because you didn't do anything wrong that there is nothing you can say that would make you look guilty.   It would be a poor decision to talk to the police and not a lawyer.    Hope it works out for you, but seriously people, stop talking to cops.   They aren't looking for information to exonerate you, they are trying to to read between the lines and try to find suspicion.   They are **investigating**.  Let someone experienced in the legal field handle this one folks.   [end]
[start] I have been sexually assaulted. It makes your boundaries unclear. This girl may be trying to find where hers are and how to enforce them. She went waaaaaay overboard. I am truly sorry. Really, this is something that should be taught in school. But then  they do say you do not have to hug people if you dont want. But you should tell them out right, not sick the police on them.   Or maybe she wants to be seen as a victim because she wants attention. Police do have to check out complaints.  [end]
[start] Lawyer up dude.  You already fucked yourself by admitting you knew her and came into physical contact with her.  Get. A. Lawyer. [end]
[start] Just let that shit go, she’s not worth 1 more minute of your time.  [end]
[start] My wife and I have had talks about this in the middle of all the public figures getting accused of assault.  As a man it’s honestly extremely scary to potentially have your entire life go up in flames because you “hugged” someone.   Even one facebook post from a random female, your co-workers could take that to HR and light a fire. In 2018, men are literally one facebook post from loosing everything, job, wife, kids, friends, family, All with out any legal evidence, just an accusation. [end]
[start] An American Horror Story  Sorry you got caught up in it. [end]
[start] This is scary crap.   I had a patient tell my manager we were having an affair. To this day I have no idea why. It ruined my life pretty much. I got fired right away. The matter was "confidential " which meant The whole hospital knew about it but I couldn't defend myself. People took this as an admission of guilt. Coworkers who were also friends stopped speaking to me. I was reported to the college of nurses and was investigated. After an agonizing YEAR they concluded that nothing had happened. But it's still on my public record that I was involved in an investigation and any prospective employer can see it. I am working but I know it raises doubt when I explain it.                                 I just kills me that just for kicks someone randomly decided to wreck my life. [end]
[start] After reading your post your a total snub lol. No wonder she reported you. [end]
[start] Holeee....Shit!!! I've never hugged a female I don't know. I was actually taught that by my mother and she told me this was the exact reason. You're fortunate the cops decided to be discreet and file protocol or it could have been a disaster. [end]
[start] > I have to think she hooked up with some new friends  Hey, so everyone has said everything else that needs to be said, but I don't see anyone commenting this -- you're 50, so the meaning has probably shifted a bit since you were a teenager/in your 20s.  "To hook up" doesn't mean just to meet up or get together with someone. Hooking up means some level of sexual activity, usually for a brief time (like a one night stand -- a fling). Where people draw the line for what is "hooking up" varies: some say it's only "hooking up" if the people had full on sex, others count making out as "hooking up" -- depends on the person.  As some examples of how it's used:  Let's say a guy named Aidan was at a party and made out with a girl named Alana. Afterwards, he might say, "yo dude I hooked up with Alana at the party last night".  Now, let's say that what had happened was that he hadn't seen Alana in a while, and didn't have her phone number anymore, and so they chatted a bit at the party and exchanged numbers to meet up in the future. If Aidan were to bump into her boyfriend and say, "oh yeah, I hooked up with Alana at the party last weekend", he might catch a fist to the jaw.  Just thought you might want to know that, to save yourself some embarrassment when talking to someone younger. [end]
[start] If only it were that easy to just politely decline a hug! Younger women especially can have a hard time setting physical boundaries, especially with older people, and anyone whose boundaries have been violated in a big enough way or often enough can find it impossible to speak up for themselves, as a form of PTSD.  I’m really sorry this happened to you, and based on what you’ve said I am assuming it’s all going to turn out OK for you.  [end]
[start] Sounds like a certain judge we all know. You got kavanaughed, buddy. I pray and hope all turns out well and the lying false accuser gets indicted and does serious jail along with getting a hefty fine and has it permanently etched in her record for the rest of her stinking, maggotty life on this earth. False accusations should start to be treated as the verbal drive by assassination attempts that they are. Crap like this makes my blood boil.  [end]

[start] Things like this muddy the waters for people who are ACTUALLY victims of sexual assault. It's unfortunate that someone who doesn't like to be hugged can accuse an innocent man of sexual assault and potentially ruin his life. I have friends who don't like being hugged and if someone comes in for a hug they politely back away and explain they do not like hugs.

[start] Shake hands from now on.  Or, as the movie Demolition Man somehow predicted, greet without physical contact. [end]
[start] In a way, it's good it's investigated because the ridiculous nature of the claim is on record to protect future would-be victims of stupid accusations from this person. Think of it that way: you are helping future men like yourself. [end]
[start] I understand why you included your age, wife and kids for context, however I am still scratching my head on why you felt the need to call out your race as if that would change our opinion of whether there was credibility to the accusation.   Victims and abusers come in all walks of life so it's probably irrelevant information unless you felt that it made you look less incriminating for some reason. [end]
[start] Cat calling is not sexual assault...it's harassment.  Touching = assault.  No touching = Harrassment.  Also, none of this actually happened.  Fake news. But!  Atleast we all learned something!  You are welcome. [end]

[TITLE] I want my teenager to cherish these moments [TITLE]
[start] Honestly one of the best things I’ve seen on this subreddit in a long time. I’m a senior in college recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I miss the pizza and horror movie marathons my high school friends and I used to have. We’d make bets on  what character was gonna die next and eat as much junk food as we could and enjoy our fast metabolisms [end]
[start] Posts like this make me mourn the adolescence I could have had. Having parents who won't let you do anything with your friends outside of school, let alone sleep overs really sucks. [end]
[start] Let him enjoy Tonite, but tell him tomorrow! [end]
[start] “milk this son”  “the point is to not drink milk, mom” [end]
[start] I miss those days, I don’t even talk to any of my friend from high school anymore. We either just grew apart over time from having different lives or had a falling out. I’m 24 and still nowhere near finishing college. I’m depressed and broke and can’t even afford food let alone my textbooks for my classes. I miss when thing were easy [end]
[start] Take a picture for when he's older. [end]
[start] Wow... This week I'm starting my last year on highschool and I feel like I haven't done anything like that. I have strict parents so I don't do that type of stuff, usually. What you said is so true, we really got to cherish these moments before we get to our mid 50s and realize we didn't have any fun. This post really really made me realize many things, thanks OP [end]
[start] When I was in high school my group of friends were from all walks of life. Some where rich and some didn’t have much money. I remember this one time we had a Halloween sleep over at this friend’s house with scary movie rental planned. We were all between 14-16 at that time.  The mother of the friend’s house that we were staying at was in the kitchen listening to our conversation of trying to figure out how much each needs to chip in to pay for a dinner for that night. She must have realized that it was financially difficult for some of the kids so she stepped in and told us she will take care of it. She orders pizzas and sushi platters for all of us with soda and juice. It was a really nice dinner. We had tons of fun and a lot for the kids really appreciated that she stepped in and helped us out so no one had to look bad. Her daughter, who grew up with a big allowance didn’t realize what was going on and was even trying to kick her mom out of the room when she tried to offer us help. Even til today I still remember that wonderful gesture she did for us. If my kids ever have the opportunity to host for their friends I will make sure to do the same thing for them. These are some of the best times of their lives and I want all of them to walk away with nothing but great memories. [end]
[start] I'm sure he will. Though the sad thing about human nature is we don't really realise we're living in the best times until the best times are gone. I'm sure he'll look back on these years and smile.   I'm sure he'll also appreciate the childhood/adolescence you gave him. It sounds like he has a great life and is well looked after. You did good, OP. [end]
[start] Wow, I am that age and have never experienced this kind of thing, kind of sad to be honest. Don’t why really, I wish I could tell if people liked me in the way to want to hang with me. Oh well [end]
[start] Saving this post.  Almost 34 here, and this is hitting quite hard right now.  Has me thinking that maybe the smallest excuses for getting a hang-out going are better than no hanging-out at all, a situation I've been in for years. [end]
[start] Couldn't agree more. We've all been there. After reading the first paragraph, the expression "Youth is wasted on the young" comes to mind. [end]
[start] I love this so much. My son had friends over for the very first time today and he just seemed so happy. I, too, want him to cherish these memories because I know they’ll mean a lot to him when he gets older. [end]
[start] It's the most unique memories that stand out in memory the most. Whatever we do to make the occasion unique will cement it more than it otherwise would be. [end]
[start] it's just crazy cuz when you're a kid, you wanna grow up so you can finally be an adult and do "grown up things." But then you grow up, and you reminisce about these times- for me it was when I was 8-11, we would rent a video or dvd every friday at the local video store, order wings and pizza from Pizza Pizza and watch a movie w/ my brother. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I wish I knew that those years of my life should of been valued more than I have. Now I regret it. Fellow teens make the most outta your responsibility-free life. [end]
[start] Bro, I'm graduating from school in a day or two. This sure as hell made me tear up... [end]
[start] Shame I had no friends, I don't cherish school at all and that's the same for a lot of people that have been bullied. [end]
[start] They will. They may not notice for a long time, but they will. [end]
[start] He'll remember them. [end]
[start] “I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.”  ― Andy Bernard [end]
[start] >If you are a teenager  Excuse me? Anyone of any age can and should enjoy "these moments." Life doesn't fucking end the minute you become a so-called "adult!" [end]
[start] Man, this made me happy for reasons I can't even fully understand. Props to you. I hope you have a beer/tea/coffee with your son 20 years from now and get to talk about this moment and all the good times inbetween. Thanks for sharing somethings so simple and nice. [end]
[start] As a teenager myself I love this post... You must be a great parent!! [end]
[start] I hope you snapped a picture of all of them having fun. Seeing a picture he didn’t know existed of this night years later will help him cherish the memories forever. Or at the very least make a fun photo for his graduation or wedding slideshow :) [end]
[start] When I was young all my friends wouldn’t wait to grow up, and I felt like the only one day “hey, you guys? This is actually pretty fuckin cool right here. I don’t think you get it!”    I try to cherish all moments though, even if I’m feeling shitty or not myself. My daughter is 15 months old and I’m trying to breath this in as much as possible. I know it’ll be over before I realize it. [end]
[start] He won’t. They never do. You don’t until you’re older. [end]
[start] I'm only 17 and I try my hardest to cherish the memories I have with my buddies whenever we do shit together because I know that only in a year or 2 we will all go our separate ways. It's a valuable life lesson [end]
[start] Good move not going out there and saying anything. By doing so would probably take away the magic from the moment. The magic being that we don't ever realize these moments till after the fact. I'm not saying we can't be aware of our own appreciation but at such a young age that magic is the beautiful ignorance of youth. Don't worry, they will remember this all someday :) [end]
[start] Now I'm depressed. [end]
[start] Some of my favourite memories from around that age were just playing videogames and watching dumb movies with my friends.   Parents should definitely try to be involved with their teenagers (but from a greater distance than when they were younger) and encourage them to do things. But if they are having fun playing games and eating pizza with their friends then let them have at it. I'd kill for a night like this now. I can still do it alone but everyone else is always too busy. [end]
[start] The thing about cherished moments like these is you don't have to tell people to cherish them. Did someone tell you to cherish the moment 30 years ago? We cherish good moments, this sounds like a good moment. [end]
[start] I did this exact same thing today with 3 of my friends except the wings were from a local place. Epic Coincidence. [end]
[start] Will do! [end]
[start] Well said. [end]
[start] Aaahhhh you dont know how much i desire moments like these [end]
[start] Setup a cell phone disruption network... [end]
[start] This is just an old quote regergitated by Democrat Senator Paul Tsongas [end]
[start] This made me feel thirty years older [end]
[start] I wish I could upvote a post multiple times [end]
[start] “milk this shit”  Nice pun [end]
[start] Tbh I have no friends so I can't cherish any moments. [end]
[start] So wonderfully said! I have a 9 year old son with a strong friend group and I love watching these types of moments that they have. [end]
[start] >I want to tell them to cherish these moments  I briefly write about things I want to remember. For example I watched a movie a while ago with a friend, and the end of the movie was really sad and my friend was bawling, while I was just silently crying, and she asked if I was sad at all. Just looking at the lines I wrote down makes me remember that movie and it is great. [end]
[start] I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. [end]
[start] This is great advice, and a good way to set your kids up to have a better, richer life.  Everything is a choice. Your time is whatever you choose to do with it. You can miss some school for special events...the day of school won't matter in 20 years , but the memories of experience will last much much longer.  I have watched my son and his friends, and remember days like that....and I am glad to say he has remained good friends with 2 of those guys, and I have no doubt they will be life long friends. They live all over the country, and are in various stages of marriage, jobs kids and such, but they make it important to keep in touch, and show up for each other. They have had some heavy shit among them, and the have dropped everything to be there. I am so proud of them all.  I am 64 years old and have friends from when I was 12, 20, 30 and a few new ones from the last 2 decades.I consider 6 or so of them lifetime friends.  My mama always said if you can count your really true friends on one hand, you are rich. She is right.  We all work hard to keep in contact. It is important to us. They make my life better, and I choose to make sure I find room for them in my life.  Make good choices. [end]
[start] It's great that this momment inspired you to talk to your child about him enjoying his youth! I think the best way to talk about this is another time, not right now. Just let them enjoy it, have their fun, then, another time, tell him about your fun when you were young, and that he with his friends remind you of that time, and that it's precious and he should cherrish it. I hope you and your family have a great day and life! [end]
[start] This is exactly what I've told myself for awhile now, if I had the chance to have friends again I'd cherish it. Feels like high school was a distant memory now even though it was a year ago. I guess people dont know how good things are til their gone. [end]
[start] Flood of memories hit me as I read this. Im actually tearing up a little. Cherish those moments! [end]
[start] They can’t understand without the wisdom of years. [end]
[start] You're a parent, and sounds like you care, so be there and be supportive.  You can't force anyone to form a memory but the positive is that will take care of itself.    You should just maximize your time being in the moment, enjoying yourself, remembering these moments, and sharing them with your son when he's old enough to appreciate them. [end]
[start] Man this comment section has onions. Who the hells cutting them [end]
[start] Rich is the ability to cherish small things... [end]
[start] Sounds like you’re a great parent.   I’m 19 and I don’t have many memories like that because my parents were too strict. I just played Xbox every weekend, that’s my cherished memory. [end]
[start] As a recent teenager; the best thing you can do to encourage him to savor these moments is to be cool about the results of that. If he feels like you’ll get upset by less than perfect grades, then he’s going to worry too much about them, for example. You sound like you’re doing great :) [end]
[start] I feel this post. [end]
[start] I wish someone said this to me four years ago [end]
[start] Amen. [end]
[start] I wish I had friends to spend time with. Instead I'm sitting alone all day isolated in my house. What can I say, some of us are too ugly to be a normal person.  I mean, if your kid gets to enjoy his teenage years good for him. Would kill to have at least the friends he has. [end]
[start] I love everything about this post. My best high school memories were sleepovers with the girls, eating way too much ice cream, crushing over teen movie stars, giggling at silly things. Trust me, he will always remember these fun times with his mates xx [end]
[start] Cringe [end]
[start] Personally, I have a hard time meeting people. [end]

[TITLE] Could Trump / Pence be bigger pussies? Hamilton cast says "be *our* president," and Trump runs to Twitter, literally demanding safe spaces. [TITLE]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] It's a smoke screen for the 25,000,000 settlement for the Trump University lawsuit. [end]
[start] Of course he's wrong. The theater has a long history of being subversive and political. Hamilton itself is a highly political production, and pence must be blind to the world to not realize what he was walking into. [end]
[start] He's just using this as a distraction so people don't pay attention to things that actually matter, like his transition and lawsuit settlement. And it's working.  [end]
[start] Just wait until he's president.  He seems to be acting like he wants to imprison people for free speech and pretty much anything else he doesn't agree with. [end]
[start] "your request for equal treatment has made me fear for my life, time to send in the riot police" [end]
[start] Sad! Apologize! Sad! [end]
[start] Obama has dealt with actual harassment from Republicans for the past 8 years (remember the booing and "you lie" during his first state of the union?) but he's never demanded an apology.    The message they gave was very in line with the themes of Hamilton, it was not harassment. They have the right to free speech. I can't believe we're going to have to deal with this thin-skinned narcissist for 4 years  [end]
[start] Is this what the next four years is going to be like? Because it seems like a bad sign when your president demands an apology every time someone disagrees with him. The whole job is about doing things that people dislike. If you can't take a little anger and criticism from the people directly impacted by your (shitty) policies and (racist/sexist) actions, maybe you're not cut out to be president... [end]
[start] Don't forget he just settled his Trump U. lawsuit for 25 million today also. [end]
[start] This is fucking hilarious. Let the chucklefuckery begin. It's going to be quite a year. [end]
[start] I'm not sure what Pence expected...The theater isn't known as a bastion of conservatism. It's not far-fetched to say 90% of the people in that room did not vote for them and strongly oppose Trump. [end]
[start] its just a rouse so that people will pay more attention to the Hamilton story than the one about Trump paying $25 million to make his fraud case "go away". [end]
[start] ...he's trolling. Stop taking the bait. [end]
[start] Trump wanted Pence? A man known for his cruel and hateful agenda against gays? Then Trump better nut up and live with it. This attitude of "gosh he's such a wonderful man, it's so wrong of you to criticize him" is bush league horse shit. He's not a wonderful man and either Trump knows it or is blind and stupid -either way, he can shut up and take it or he can quit. [end]
[start] I generally agree with your reaction, but Trump didn't demand safe spaces.  He said:  > The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!  [Safe spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space) are different. But yes, his reaction was ridiculous and over the top. [end]
[start] 'Safe Spaces', That's the joke. [end]
[start] The worst part is that he's trying to mock the concept of safe spaces while simultaneously whining about not having one.   As if a millionaire protected 24/7 by dozens of elite security personnel and the most advanced privacy tech in the world has any right to ask for such a thing.         The cognitive dissonance is strong with this one.  [end]
[start] I wonder who the comedian is going to be at his first White House correspondent's dinner. We can only pray for a repeat of Colbert during the Bush years.   [end]
[start] The idea that he's somehow asking for a "safe space" is ludicrous. Quite the grasping at straws on this one. As other performers have come out and said, most of whom denounce Trump, you just don't treat your fans and customers this way. It's unprofessional.   Of course, the believers in "safe spaces" who are wrongly accusing Pence/Trump of wanting one, are also showing how ridiculous the idea of "safe spaces" are by mocking them when they incorrectly judge others as wanting one.   The frenzy from the left needs to die down. There are Hillary supporters denouncing family and friends just because Trump won. It's insanity. [end]
[start] I'm still amazed by what a hypocrite Trump is--everything he accuses other people of he's guilty of to an exponential degree. And all the idiots in the Donald think he's a tough guy? And they're all "alpha" tough guys? And anyone with an IQ over 65 is cuck? Har! Har! Overcompensating, insecure idiots. They need a "god Emperor" to tell them what to think and praise their ignorance and bigotry.  [end]
[start] I'm baffled.  I'm dying of laughter.  The Trump fanbase narrative of being anti-safespace has 180'd itself with Trump demanding a safespace.  In how many ways will Trump 180?   [end]
[start] Looking on the bright side, I guess it's a good sign this is news. We have nothing worse happening than some people booing at other people they disagree with. And then those people getting upset. [end]
[start] Their hides better toughen up real quick. Particularly if they want to continue on the course that they've apparently chosen. [end]
[start] I think Trump's throwing a hissy fit  cuz' Lin-Manuel [called him](https://youtu.be/AsupmN90wBk?t=163) a piece of  [end]
[start] /r/t_d made a post insinuatingly comparing how Hamilton actually died to this event. Maybe not insinuating someone should do it, but basically another "2nd amendment people" type statement. How pathetic are these people? [end]
[start] There was the opinion posted here recently of Trump's biographer, saying that he is such a narcissist he's never going to be able to handle the rough-and-tumble and name-calling to which Presidents are ordinarily subject.  48 hours later: bam! "stop being mean to us". [end]
[start] Its actually genius - totally took his settling his Trump University debacle out of the news.  I'll give him props for that. [end]
[start] This is making you all look like children.  [end]
[start] It'd be pretty hilarious if it wasn't so dangerous a stance for a president to take.  But yes, Trump U is what everyone should be talking about.  [end]
[start] Down voted for posting websites with hyperuintrusive advertising. Other than that neat post! [end]
[start] Very Sad! Apologize! Sad! [end]
[start] Theatre is a live entertainment where artists engage audience and unexpected situation may arise. Watching TV would be a safer alternative for cowards. Politicians are not supposed to tell artists what is or what is not appropriate.  [end]

[start] Lol in Canada you’ll often hear “just gonna skootch past ya, sorry”. [end]
[start] Ope, ya, sure. [end]
[start] Now it's more like: "ope" *takes a step back* [end]
[start] Does any body else say “sir” to anyone who they see is male, even kids? I always catch myself saying “no sir” or “yes sir” to children I come in contact with. [end]
[start] As a New Yorker living in the Midwest it’s been weeks since someone has said this to me and I’ve internally fumed at why Midwesterners can’t just say “excuse me” 😂 [end]
[start] My dad's family is from Michigan but I'm born and raised in California. I've been saying this all my life. [end]
[start] "Ope, sure, lemme just get on out of your way now. There ya go." [end]
[start] I’m from Michigan, and I didn’t realize this was a Midwesterner thing 😂 [end]
[start] I’m from the Boston area. I haven’t had a honking/shouting match with anyone on the road in a while. So I guess I kinda feel ya..? [end]
[start] I just realized I haven’t “waved anybody through at a 4 way stop even though I had the right of way” in while. [end]
[start] It's pop. [end]
[start] I say a similar phrase all the time despite living in Alabama my entire life. Lots of my family is from Ohio though. [end]
[start] This is weird... I'm from the south eastern area of Ontario, Canada and I literally say "I'm going to sneak past you real quick" every day when I slip past a forklift driver. [end]
[start] Ok I say this and I’ve lived in the Pacific Northwest all my life and so has my entire family and I need to know who infected me with this language tic [end]
[start] You’re from Ohio aren’t you? Lol [end]
[start] Today u open yur mouth to speak, they look at u in horror [end]
[start] How do you pronounce "ope"? [end]
[start] I haven't been able to be the one to apologize when someone bumps into me (Midwesterner here, too). I'm looking forward to the day when I can needlessly apologize for this again! [end]
[start] I said this in the grocery store yesterday and it was because I didn't see them and got within 6 ft. [end]
[start] As a displaced Southern boy, it's always "'Scuse me, y'all. I'm gonna sneak past ya." [end]
[start] This is the purest thing in this thread. [end]
[start] Hi diddly-ho neighbourino. [end]
[start] I bump into the table and still go Ope.. Even when no one is around..  I don't apologize, of course..  Fuck that table for being in my way.. [end]
[start] I still do it even if I bump into something or my dog. LOL [end]
[start] Hahaha shit...a daily line. [end]
[start] Ah well jeez hun [end]
[start] My moms side moved from the Midwest to tx and now we all say “ope” bc of them [end]
[start] Born and raised in TX. I do this. [end]
[start] I have but only cause I work at Walmart and everyone wants to crowd around in the toilet paper isle talking about how we are on quarantine. [end]
[start] As a Kansan, I felt this HARD [end]
[start] Omg I’ve been saying this all my life and I didn’t understand where it came from. My dad is from the Midwest and my mom lived there for a couple years. (I live in Seattle) [end]
[start] I say that all the time. No idea it was a midwestern thing. Illinois here [end]
[start] Honestly hearing this hurt my heart, because same. [end]
[start] No, yeah. You’re right [end]
[start] LOL I’m Canadian and we say this too. The jokes about us apologizing for everything are accurate :) [end]
[start] Canadian here. I feel your pain. Hoser. [end]
[start] I grew up in the northeast but I live in a south-central state now. The first time I said "do what?" I almost cried. I still do say wicked from time to time though! [end]
[start] Last night I was just thinking about some of my Midwest-isms. “You bet” and “I’m fixing to...” are some old standbys, along with lots of “Ope, sorry”s. [end]
[start] I just realized how many people have said that to me [end]
[start] As a Canadian, I haven't held the door for anyone in weeks. It's getting a bit odd. [end]
[start] I live in Wisconsin and I relate [end]
[start] Oh my gosh I haven't said it lately either!!! I didn't know I was missing out. Ope sorry [end]
[start] Aw, this got me in the feels [end]
[start] I’m an Iowan living last 16 years in Raleigh, NC.  I actually pegged a woman as Iowan by her use of “ope” at a Whole Foods.  She thought I was a spy. [end]
[start] My saying is, "right behind you" from when I worked in restaraunts. I was able to use it in the grocery store the other day! Lol [end]
[start] I live in NWA (Northwest Arkansas) and have said this nearly my entire life (17 years). Both my parents are from Texas and have nearly never said it and I have no idea where I got it from. [end]
[start] I just say "sorry can i just... **squeezing sound**" [end]
[start] From OK same here. [end]
[start] I grew up in Philly and say this.   Is it not a country wide thing? Or am I just weird [end]
[start] I've said that. Didn't know it was a Midwest thing. [end]
[start] I could hear that in my brain. We have similar versions of that in the northwest too. [end]
[start] I did not realize the frequency that I do this until recently [end]
[start] I felt this on a very personal level. [end]
[start] Holy shit, this just hit too close to home [end]
[start] my palms be itchin to say this [end]
[start] I say this, and tell people at work to “just pitch it” instead of “throw it away”, and they look at me like I’m crazy (I live in Baltimore). I have always wondered if “pitch it” is a midwestern thing. [end]
[start] As a midwesterner this is hilarious! I catch myself saying ope so many times hahaha [end]
[start] I still say this... I live in Sweden.  Caught myself at the grocery store saying “Ope, ska bara smyga förbi dig lite...”  Always a Midwesterner I guess. [end]
[start] I live in Virginia now for a year-and-a-half and I haven't lost it yet. I try to use it regularly so it's still part of my regular speech pattern :-) [end]
[start] I'm from CT and I do this 🤔 [end]
[start] As a New Yorker I don't have to say "fucking move idiot" nearly as much and I miss it. [end]
[start] Down south we say "scuuuuuuuse me..." [end]
[start] Will we ever humanly recover from this pandemic?🐯🦁 Jokes aside, I really hope it comes back soon too! [end]
[start] Oh Jesus you're right....I use to think I didn't say ope....until one day it was said by myself extremely clearly and I was horrified lol. Now I embrace it hahaha. [end]
[start] I know I'm a little late but I moved away from the Midwest about a year ago and just the other day I said "ope, sorry" when I shot the wrong thing in a video game. The Midwest will always be a part of you, so fear not! [end]
[start] I believe we are are all going to have to redefine "soon", and more's the pity. [end]
[start] I see "ope" referenced as a Midwestern thing on Reddit all the time, but I've also always said/heard it in the South my whole life. I think it's an American thing. Can anyone from other regions corroborate? [end]
[start] Is this akin the wonderful odd speech I saw in Fargo? If not, please point me. Not to farhgo, ha, but to a video that shows your language. Thanks. [end]
[start] I lived most of my life in the Chicago and Milwaukee area and can't remember the people around me saying "Ope"  Maybe it's just a thing outside those areas,of course ymmv [end]
[start] i don't think i ever said that tbh and i live in ohio [end]
[start] Damn, if you also like tea then by the sounds of it you're pretty much a British citizen at heart (Also if you frequently change The word "sneak" to "squeeze" in your sentence) [end]
[start] I’m from the southeast and I’ve never heard anyone say that but it’s such a cute and pleasant sounding thing, I might have to start using it [end]
[start] Can I get a side of ranch ? [end]
[TITLE] Dear parents: DO NOT HAVE A OFF-THE-GRID BABY [TITLE]
[start] I’m not sure what state you’re in, or I’d provide the number directly. However, if you have access to the internet, look up “foster care ombudsman (insert state)”. Former social worker of 20+ years and have found they can be an invaluable resource. Love and hugs. [end]
[start] I have nothing to add that may help, just wanted to say I am sorry you are dealing with something that affects your life so much that you had no say on. [end]
[start] You could become an assasin and be the perfect untraceable asset [end]
[start] I’m so sorry to hear this. I was a home birth as well, and at 18 applied for a delayed registration of birth. It took two years as my family didn’t have any “proof” I was born aside from vaccination records. By the time I got a job, I couldn’t cash my own paychecks. My parents were divorced and spelled my name differently, so that my birth certificate and SSN have the same name spelled in two ways. What I’m trying to say is the sooner you can get this taken care of, the better. It’s truly a huge pain in the ass [end]
[start] You seem extremely smart and eloquent for a 17 year old with two drug addicted parents and one hell of an upbringing. You will absolutely go so far in this life, please don’t give up. [end]
[start] Dude you're the perfect Hitman. Very minimal records. You're a literal ghost in the system.   For real though i hope you get all them papers so you can finally live your life. Good luck :) [end]
[start] Here is an article about a young woman who underwent something similar in the US:  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/03/12/how-a-teenagers-viral-campaign-to-prove-her-citizenship-is-inspiring-a-new-texas-bill/%3foutputType=amp [end]
[start] I would post this in r/legaladvice !!!  Lots of lawyers in that sub!!! Free advice! Lawyers are expensive! I’d take advantage of this sub if I were you. [end]
[start] Have you been reaching out to anyone but your appointed attorney? It might be time to start reaching out to any representatives in your area (Senator, congressman, any local reps) and the media. Getting a little light shone on your story might not be what you want or what's fair to you but it could definitely get the ball rolling. [end]
[start] I was almost the same. My dad wanted me undocumented, and drove me and my mom home before they gave me my information. My grandparents drove us back to get it. They still argue over it. Apparently, my dad wanted a “spy baby” [end]
[start] Deep breath... It’ll all work out. Things are messed up right now. Can you find an atty to help you before you turn 18? [end]
[start] I have first hand knowledge of someone who had no birth certificate.  As it turns out it is easier to get a delayed birth certificate in some states than others. The person I know managed to get a Florida birth certificate even though they were born in Indiana. [end]
[start] Holy shit...I'm sorry to hear what you are going though.  I can't even begin to imagine what that situation is like.  Things will work out.  You are still young and have a lot of time to straighten this out. [end]
[start] Good luck and all the hugs x [end]
[start] This sucks, I’m sorry you’re in this situation. I would call your public defenders sub and your social worker every other day until they get this done. This is their job, and they need to make it happen. Once you’re 18, I feel like it will be even more difficult.   I wish I could help! [end]
[start] That is so absolutely awful. I am so sorry. I hope someone who can help sees this post and helps! [end]
[start] How things have changed so much.  My Father got his birth certificate when he was in high school, not easy, but not near as hard as your experience.  He was born in a rural area.  Need the cert to join the ROTC.  About 85 years ago.  He story was needing to find enough people to attest to his birth to a local judge. [end]
[start] This is Ron Swanson’s fantasy. [end]
[start] I was at a hippie festival and met a someone named bobcat that was selling dirty Kentucky schwag and following some jam band around with her partner and their child chinacat sunflower that they had off the grid.  I said it like, fifteen years ago, but this reinforces it; "That kid isn't gonna have an easy life." [end]
[start] Would it be over-reaction to send the letter to the judge who made the ruling? [end]
[start] I am so so sorry for what you’re going through/have gone through. I don’t know where you’re located, but look into if you have a Court Appointed Special Advocate or Guardian Ad Litem. Both organizations are amazing. I’ve volunteered with GAL and I know that they are an amazing resource for kids in the foster care system. They can really relieve the stress that comes with being a kid in the court system. Sending lots of love your way! [end]
[start] I do not know how much this will help you, but there is a Radiolab podcast on this. The woman was able to get a birth certificate, but it was quite difficult.   https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/invisible-girl [end]
[start] You don't have to be born in a hospital to get a birth certificate, but yeah--your parents definitely messed up not getting you one after the fact. I assume you already know about Delayed Birth Certificates? (I'm just going to assume they mentioned that and not go into details. If they didn't, you should definitely google it). [end]
[start] Hi OP. I’m not sure what state you’re in, but I’m a former DMV employee. I was a policy analyst, and one of my areas of expertise was assisting customers who were in situations like yours, where they didn’t have their documents to prove lawful status/identity/SSN for a license, and genuinely couldn’t acquire them. While my state did have very specific laws about the documents required, we had an exceptions process if you couldn’t get your documents. We understood that people were often in a catch-22, where in order to get the documents we required they needed government-issued photo ID, but we couldn’t give that ID until they provided the documents. While we had a documented exceptions process, I facilitated exceptions even beyond that. The exceptions process and the fact we granted exceptions was not publicized.   In whatever state you are in, there is my equivalent, at DMV, DHS, and even SSA. The difficult thing is getting in contact with the correct analyst/manager/administrator that can actually assist you. My best advice to you would be to contact your state representative, and have them help. They will have contacts at DHS, who will work from the top down to figure out what’s going with your case, and get you what you need. And having a legislator breathing down your neck is the quickest way to get a government agency to become very helpful, very quickly. At my agency dealing with legislator concerns took priority over almost everything else (and I was much more likely to recommend an exception if it was a grey area, because I knew if I said no, at some point  down the line we would probably be told to grant the exception). If you were to go into an office or ask a call center agent, there was only a very slight chance you could get escalated to me. If you contacted a legislator, they would go to our government affairs liaison, who would come to me directly to deal with the situation.    I wish you luck. Having worked with folks in similar scenarios, I know how shitty of a situation you’re in. I hope you connect with the right people who can actually help you. [end]
[start] just out of curiousity and please feel free to refuse to answer but why did they have you off the grid? [end]
[start] My parents knew a family with 7+ kids and they were all off the grid babies. They said they would allow for the kids to get “back on the grid” when they were older but it’s SUPER hard to do that. [end]
[start] SOMEONE SUMMON LEGAL EAGLE FROM YOUTUBE! [end]
[start] My parents had funky stupid weird religious reasons to have off-grid babies. It’s crazy, and weird, I know, but you’re not the first person this has ever happened to. I know you’re freaked out. Rightfully so. But this isn’t that new. You’re more than what documentation says you are. Focus on what you are, what you have, and then...what the next step will be. All will right itself.  Please feel free to DM if interested or need to vent & someone relatable.  You got this [end]
[start] It’s hard to believe but I believe it, I couldn’t imagine how painful that must be. I wonder how many other people like yourself could be out of the system unable to get medical attention, or anything else for that matter that requires you to be legally existing because of their parents failing to get a birth certificate and all of the other necessary documentation. I’d imagine I would feel the same way in your shoes, I’m very sorry that you were neglected and abused like that. [end]
[start] If you ever want to commit any crimes, now would be the time to do it!   In all seriousness, you sound like one hell of a trooper and extremely mature for a 17 year old. much more aware of everything going on around you than I was at 17. It sucks that you had no other choice, and that you were essentially robbed of being care-free for your teenage years. You sound like an incredible human being with great integrity. You will go places once this is all sorted out.   I wish I knew how to help you in your situation, but I do want to tell you to NEVER feel invalidated as a human being just because you didn’t have the paperwork. you are a beautiful work of art with a body and soul! [end]
[start] This happened to 3 of my uncle's. One joined the military. And still can't leave and come back. You're best bet is to find out who your midwife was.. and get her and anyone else who might have witnessed your birth, to write affidavits.. and get a DNA test matching your parents. It's shitty. And its a lot of work. Im sorry that this happens so often. [end]
[start] Are you Roy? HEY GUYS THIS GUY HAS NO SS #! [end]
[start] If you only have elementary school records, how come you talk about being high in high school a year ago? Before you made the post about you now being in a foster home? [end]
[start] Sooo life is a series of annoying paperwork and being on hold with the dmv for everyone. Not to downplay that your folks certainly fucked up and thats sad. But this is truly fixable. You can get it fixed. They will give you a birth certificate and ssn# eventually. And the good news is that you are now almost at the age where you get to make your own choices and you don’t have to be with your folks anymore. It sounds like that’s gonna be a huge improvement for you. If i were you id try to learn a trade, like carpentry or cooking, something that you don’t need a history of schooling to excel at. And remember how badly drugs fucked up your folks so try to not fall into the same trap. Your life is on the precipice of greatness. You got this! [end]
[start] Well, I know that I am taking things literally right now, but when the problem is government documents and one can’t get a job anywhere, the last place that would want you is the government. And I know, I know, it was facetious, but as someone who’s tried to walk alongside folks that have dealt with similar things, I recommend not making light of the situation. [end]
[start] Maybe this doesn't come off as tongue and cheek, but I hope you find yourself someday soon.          I imagine not identifying documents of any kind could be hard, but the fact that your parents have essentially abandoned you adds a whole layer of actually finding out who you really are.  You're just in survival mode all the time with no chance of self reflection or self improvement.          Good luck!  Don't hesitate to ask for help. [end]
[start] I'm surprised that this isn't a post about how that way is better because you can't be tracked by the government or whatever. [end]
[start] Maybe you could get a job as a spy for the CIA since you don't technically exist might make their job easier. [end]
[start] Rob a bank so that they can’t trace your photo from the cameras and you’re good [end]
[start] ROY! [end]
[start] Join cia. [end]
[start] Wow I've never thought of someone having an off grid baby. So many questions and what ifs are going through my head. But I wonder what grief you would've went through if not being taken by DHS. If you turned 18 without anything to identify yourself I couldn't imagine how your life would've been. Do you know if your parents have any charges facing them for not having you documented?  I hope you get your SSN and BC soon and so you can do all the things you want and more. [end]
[start] This sounds like the memoir called “Educated.” Phenomenal book [end]
[start] I completely understand this, my dad threw out my birth certificate when I was a teen because he got angry with me, and it caused A LOT of problems when I moved across the country. I hope everything works out for you my dude [end]
[start] Having birth at home is generally a no-no. My mom had no choice since we lived in a very small isolated mining town with no hospital, but it caused a lot of hell for me and still affects me today.   For the love of god, if you have the choice of giving birth in a hospital, DO IT. [end]
[start] Wow wtf? Is this even a thing? How did you manage to get into school if you don't have any documentation? Did your parents forge some or what?    I'm sorry about what's going on with you :/ [end]
[start] Yeah I don’t think anyone who would have a baby in a basement and never take it to the doctor probably doesn’t have the moral compass to listen to this, let alone a reddit account that follows r/self. [end]
[start] I was actually born at home, but had my birth certificate registered at a seperate office. So you can have an at-home birth as long as you go to an office later. [end]
[start] That really sucks, I’m sorry to bring this up but are you sure your parents are your birth parents have you had a DNA test done or any solid evidence?  I just find it extremely odd that your birth wasn’t registered they had 17 years to do it and you’ve never been to a doctor? [end]
[start] I'm sorry for all the trouble this has caused, I just wanted to mention a side note in regards to you having never seen a doctor... Look into getting yourself routine vaccines that you may have not gotten as a child, this could save your life. [end]
[start] Why would they do that? [end]
[start] I know u won't probably reply to this, but since you said your mother was on some sort of drugs when you were in her womb, do u have any superpowers or unusual abilities due to your mother's drug abuse during pregnancy? [end]
[start] You could find some other off-the-grid people and start a small country in the woods [end]
[start] You would be able to get away with literally anything even murder honestly just become a thief or an assassin or something crazy and live at your fucking life trust me you don’t want the government holding you down [end]
[start] Just become the joker [end]
[start] At least you didn't get any vaccinations so you aren't autistic. I'd consider that a win. [end]
[start] Lol pretty sure all Amish children, tribal children, native children etc love their parents. Nice try. [end]

[TITLE] A girl in my city just escaped self-quarantine and the entire city is about to be locked down. Everybody is furious. [TITLE]
[start] Like dead islands banoi... can't not think about it sorry..  But I honestly can't believe someone would be so selfish that they don't care who they infect with a possibly deadly virus. [end]
[start] As soon as I read "her chauffeur and her maid..." I wasn't surprised in the slightest she would do something so selfish. I could be wrong, as I don't know about wealth levels in Vietnam, but in the U.S.A you don't have those things unless you are wealthy (maids less so, but the chauffeur is specific). Wealthy people can be exceptionally selfish and I wouldn't be all that surprised if she thought she was "above" getting sick.  &#x200B;  I am so so sorry your city is having to experience this because of one awful person's choices.

[start]  I'm a Vietnamese as well and i was so furious when reading the news. What I'm afraid now is that she might be a super spreader here and we all know how terrible it is by looking South Korea. Hopefully it won't happen and everything will be under control soon. I'm proud of how our government and people's efforts against this disease. I'm not in Vietnam right now but i hope you guys stay safe and take care. ❤ [end]
[start] Ok, I’m sorry but FUCK HER. She is absolute scum. Unbelievable. [end]
[start] She should be charged with felonies. Come on people. WTF? [end]
[start] holy cow. this is why the virus is so terrifying.  I'm in California and I was at CVS yesterday -- apparently at 11:30 am on a Thursday a lot of people buy beer and handles of vodka there too, but that's beside the point -- and a 50ish y/o woman greets a woman she knows waiting in line. She hugs and gets all up on her, and the they're chatting and the woman in line mentions the virus. The woman who's not in line is totally clueless about it and apparently thinks its a joke and is like, "oh is that right? well, am i going to get it now? haha!" THEN she proceeds to hug the two people behind in line, because she thinks it's so funny and she knows they heard her. She stopped when she got to me thankfully. She then went further down the line and started badgering some dude to give her a ride home.  Meanwhile, the woman she hugged and two more people in line start discussing the virus (cuz obviously it's on everyone's minds. I mean we're at a CVS too...the place you go for health things!), and how to make DIY hand sanitizer. So clearly THEY knew what was up, but that other woman....Like what the fuck? Do you read the news? Or converse with people who read it? Mind blowing. How can you be so oblivious? [end]

[start] You get to stay at home for two weeks, watch netflix or play games and you think exposing others to a disease, even if it's not that much more deadly than the common flu, is fun?It iis still just an dick move, especially to children and elderly and other people who have a bad immune system already.  I am not a friend of this media representation of it. Estimations are around 0,3% to 0,7% across the world in death rates. Yes that includes third world countries. But we can't be entirely sure. Some assume its closer to 2%, nothing to joke about for sure.    What I am trying to say, yes it's probably not even close to being as deadly as ebola which has a 90% death rate, but playing stupid games gives you stupid prizes and you will probably be hated by all the people around you to the end of your life.    Why even risk it?    For most people it's not deadly. Experts even say if you are under 40 you should be fine as long as your fever stays under 38°C you have nothing to worry and be back to full health after around 2 weeks. If its above 38°C you may develop symptoms similar to a lung infection, if that happens contact a doctor or whoever is responsible in your area.   In many regions people will deliver you food when you stay at home, so no need to buy out stores.   Use basic human sense and logic and you will be fine. And others around you too.   Some people.

[start] please stay safe!! i can't believe a person could be that selfish and irresponsible [end]
[start] ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, zzz,,, [end]
[start] I honestly do not understand the whole “self quarantine” or “self isolation” concept. Here in Canada our prime minister already said he won’t be banning anyone into our country but people are to self isolate at home for 2 weeks if they just returned from high risk countries. Do they really expect people to honour this? How does this work? [end]

[start] Its cruel to throw shade and hatred at this woman. MOST people do not seek a doctor if they have a cough. And when this person went to Italy it wasnt anounst over there yet, she later did seek medial attention, and it did say in the article she self quarentine back home. Sounds like OP wants to point fingers and put blame but really no one does this on purpose [end]
[start] that's what i was saying the whole time to people i know. there will be one selfish and stupid person who's gonna contract it who has the symptoms, refuse to go see a doctor before travelling and give it to a whole bunch of people before she had the need to go to the hospital.      I always said that the best thing that all the countries who have big spreading of the virus should do right now is close the borders , closing the airports and stopping people from travelling to the countries and to tell people who are travelling right now to return home immediately and for the other countries who don't have it to filter the people that come from the countries who have it and then make them make a u-turn and return home for that it will contain it and make stop the spreading of this disease. [end]
[start] Wow this virus is a nightmare [end]
[start] I wish there'd be martial law specifically for these kinds of people. Shoot them down immediately before they cause any harm. Selfish cunts. [end]
[start] Yeah for her to be so irresponsible she must a narcissist or who knows maybe she's got someone depending on her and isn't thinking clearly but even then she should be thinking about what could happen if someone she cares about gets infected. Dear lord she's beyond irresponsible. [end]
[start] Mark her for death, get EVERYONE to try to kill her. [end]
[start] What the fuck?! What is wrong with her [end]
[start] good luck to all my vietnamese peoples [end]
[start] She needs to be in jail. After she gets rid of the virus of course [end]
[start] Just kill her? [end]
[start] I know it must be hard on so many levels.  But at least your government is bring proactive.  In America we have a president that had not acknowledged that we have an issue and just recently (one day ago) decided to actively find our Center for Disease control.  Beyond that, only a few measures have been taken to co trip the spread.  I'm certainly no doctor or scientist but I can see the spread of infection hitting so hard and fast there won't be enough medical staff or room to house the sick.  People will just stay home from work to avoid contact and instead of a government issued quarantine, we won't know what businesses are open, closed, it'll be chaotic.  I'm so sorry someone so selfish is hurting so many in your community and I hope your government finds a way to solve the problem without more pain to your people and city. [end]
[start] how did people lose their livelihood already? I thought Vietnam was still communist how does she have a chaffeur and a maid? [end]
[start] Hazmaz? Wazaz? [end]
[start] Well look at it this way. Only 1-3% of ppl who contract the virus die. That’s a terribly small margin. Also. Of those ppl that died (specifically in China) they were mostly over the age of 60.   I’m not saying we shouldn’t be concerned about something like this, and that it doesn’t pay to reconsider public hygiene habits, but I’m getting tired of the media hyping this thing up, and sending everyone into such a fucking tizzy.  This is a flu virus with a mortality rate lower than almost all of the viruses we’ve seen in recent years. Remember West Nile Virus? Once contracted, it had a 68% mortality rate. And yet somehow we all survived. Consider that. I feel for ppl in these urban settings, they’re definitely getting the worst of it. But this too shall pass. Breathe everyone. [end]

[start] start by sitting or standing and just breathing for a few minutes. take some time to enjoy the free time you've found. from there, if it's a nice day outside i recommend a walk or just sitting outside in the grass. if you're limited to indoor time, tea and a good book are always a calming activity for me.

[start] Sounds like your professor wanted to enjoy the day. [end]

[start] Id take the day to do other work he's basically just giving you a free day to get stuff done. [end]
[start] If its nice out and you can manage it, go for a walk. After you are done have a glass of water and clean up your space a bit. Then, watch a relaxing movie or tv show. My relaxing show is King of the Hill.   Ive found that a focus inward on improving your own life, even something like cleaning up the kitchen or doing laundry, combining it with a relaxing mindset leads to a real enjoyment of the day. "Boy today sure was nice.. AND i accomplished this thing."  Go forward into the day and enjoy it. [end]
[start] Ya, so she could enjoy HER day [end]
[start] 🤣🤣🤣Mines begun singing how great our class can be if we "open our damn mouths." [end]

[start] In college back in the day (this would have been fall 2005) I had a four credit intro to visual language course with two professors who later became my advisors. One day mid quarter one of the professors was there in class waiting for the other, the second professor walked into the room, looked around, said "we haven't had a fuck it Friday in a while, so fuck it, it's Friday" and turned around and walked away. The other professor just shrugged his shoulders and said "alright" and got up and left. [end]
[start] How you going to get a zero on your day off?   For real though watch some Scooby-Doo and have a burrito. [end]

[start] damn that’s so wholesome!!!! I wish mine did that instead he’s saying we still need to do work over the break ffs [end]
[start] What's the course? Are they going to set a task in future about your experience in this day? If not, maybe it's not worth thinking too much into it, maybe they had to cancel the session and that's just how they worded it [end]

[start] If 90% of cops are the good ones who condemn the bad ones acts, then what the fuck are you guys doing?   90% should be enough to called out the system, 90% should be enough to protest against the way your department is acting. If 90% of all the “good” cops weren’t protecting the bad ones instead, and actually standing up for police brutality, things would havé changed faster.  Yet, this is not the case. Civilians are protesting now for something the “good” cops should have protest a long time ago. Now we see some departments walking with the protesters, but they should have done that shit way before.   All I see on my feed are bad cops abusing their power on normal civilians and getting away with it because their colleagues let them be. No way you will see a bad cop getting cuffed by a “good” cop during a protest for, I don’t know, shooting rubber balls at non-protesters that are just trying to get home?  What am I saying, you can’t just say “boohoo these are bad cops, I’m not like them” and go on your life as normal. That’s also being a bad cop in my opinion, because you’re not helping the population, just your own ass. [end]
[start] I need to ask. I hear that phrase, "90% of cops are good people", all the time. But, if that were true, George Floyd would still be alive. You had 4 cops present and one choked the life out of him while three looked the other way. Why do I not see more condemnation of these actions by other cops? Why don't the "good" cops intervene when their co-worker is being a piece of shit? [end]
[start] The police force has turned into a violent gang. Even if some cops are “good”, they’ll still protect their “brothers in blue” when their racist antics get an innocent man killed. [end]
[start] >FPS officers getting shot and murdered  You failed to mention the other side of the coin. Cops murdering, injuring and driving into citizens. Rioting or not, the use of lethal force or physical violence in situations that don't warrant it is abundant. [end]
[start] ACAB [end]
[start] We know there are police officers who are good people. But we also know that police have a culture to defend the ones that are bad people. That's the secondary part of what everyone is upset with. [end]
[start] I've only ever been harassed by cops. I've gotten home from work at 3 in the morning to find them waiting outside my house just to fuck with me. I was never a bad kid, I never dealt drugs or anything, there was literally no reason for them to be outside my house. I park my car across the street and the lights come on. They pull me out of the car and fucking interrogate me in the middle of the street.."who are you, where do you live, what are you doing."   In the confusion, I locked my wallet and keys in my car, and effectively locked myself out of my house. I told them that I was tired and that I was now locked out, but I could knock on the door and my family would let me in. They proceeded to make" jokes", saying "well how are you going to get in without your keys? They finally left and I was able to go to sleep, but the only reason this happened was because my neighbor, whose house I parked in front of, is friend with the police department, and he's had a problem with my family ever since 7-year-old me walked my brand new puppy too close to his lawn. So the cops were happy to jump into a fight that was fueled by an old white man's 15-year grudge against someone they had absolutely no other interest in.   This was just one of my milder encounters with asshole cops, but it was still pointless harassment. It's time you all realize that you're not untouchable. I'm glad that you are affected by this, though I guarantee it's nowhere near the bullshit your people have put me through. [end]
[start] We are fighting for the rest 10%, that are killing black people with no consequences. [end]
[start] No offense but I don’t believe the 90% of cops BS.   Most Nazis probably didn’t kill jews, they just stood by and let it happen or simply transported them to a camp. But we don’t go around saying 90% of Nazis were good. They were still Nazis regardless if they killed a Jew because they supported and protected the people that did. Cops are just nazis against black Americans. The camp they take them to is the prison ran by gangs instead of the people meant to protect them. They’ve convicted and killed enough innocent black men legally to be comparable to Nazis. I’m Jewish by the way and I don’t take talking about Nazis lightly. [end]
[start] I mean, that's a nice little story but police brutality is still a problem. Pretending it isn't doesn't solve it. It's up to you to hold your fellow cops responsible. You should understand why people are upset. [end]
[start] I don't believe a single word of this pity party nonsense.  Woe are the oppressors. Won't someone think of their feelings right now!?! [end]
[start] The police are only as good as the racist officers they protect. So stop protecting them. [end]
[start] Copaganda [end]
[start] This is bullshit. Even if 5% of the cops are the evil asshats that bully and murder people to feel strong, the other 95% let them get away with it. As do the police unions and government officials.   You are the problem. [end]

[start] Try not to pull a muscle patting yourself on the back. [end]
[start] You seem genuine...  I have tons of family in the force...both sheriffs as well as city pd...I get that most are good cops.this being said,mi don’t know how many speak up against the brotherhood. If I knew my brother was killing people and I defend him, try and cover up data, turn off my body cams, etc...that makes me an accessory to murder. Even my family who are in the force know I am not happy when they blue shield a dude who is obviously guilty. This all being said...  Just wanted to let you know that you are doing good here...denouncing the murder of this poor man is the right thing to do. We need the cops to do more of this. The more cops defend bad cops, the more the stereotype can thrive that all cops are bad...fight that man, I am sure you do, but it’s necessary. But we need cops to stand up to the bad ones amongst you.  We know there will always be bad apples...but when the entire system protects those bad apples, people will eventually turn violent because they have nothing to lose. Keep doing what right and please weed out the bad apples as much as you can. It would do wonders if when you find a bad Apple, the entire force doesn’t protect them at their home while the city burns. An entire battalion it seemed was there to protect this murderer, while the city was left seemingly unattended. Minnesota PD has a lot to answer for, but standing up and living that oath you took will go a long ways...good luck man. [end]
[start] dear reddit, one of those Blacks was nice to me today, upvotes to the left [end]

[start] Damn, you feel bad about all these things but not about George Floyd.  Your pig buddies are injuring peaceful protesters right now.  You can find tons of videos on r/bad_cop_no_donut , but yeah, I'm sure 99% of the piggies in your department are good. [end]

[start] u/PM_ME_PICS_OF_DONUTS lost the script a bit while talking to u/BackThatch, saying that the media are the enemy of the state and cop killers. He's deleted his comments. Here they are, for posterity.   [**PM\_ME\_PICS\_OF\_DONUTS** **(deleted by user)**](https://www.reddit.com/user/PM_ME_PICS_OF_DONUTS)**0** **points**2 hours ago  If you're apart of the American media, you are a part, a HUGE part of the problem.  Your bullshit sensationalist and race baiting headlines are exhausting and doesn't represent reality or facts at all. I despise all mainstream media because it's clear they're all more interested in their agendas than actually providing information in an unbiased way.  WHITE COP SHOOTS UNARMED BLACK MALE. You click the article to find out the "unarmed black male" was only unarmed in the sense that he didn't have an actual firearm but he didn't have a BB gun that was indistinguishable from a real firearm.  I watched an interview between two liberal journalists the other day who spent 20 minutes saying how difficult it is in 2020 to simply get information that is muddled with narrative driven bullshit, and it was some of the truest words I've ever heard.  And why would you only mention Fox News? If you are a real and fair journalist, you know that EVERY mainstream media outlet is more interested in their narratives than telling the truth. CNN is awful, WaPo is awful, NYT is awful. They're all terrible.  Again, idk where you are in the world, but if you are an American journalist who works for any of these outlets, in my eyes you are a public enemy who disguises yourself as a heroic reporter.  [**PM\_ME\_PICS\_OF\_DONUTS** **(deleted by user)**](https://www.reddit.com/user/PM_ME_PICS_OF_DONUTS)**0** **points**2 hours ago  \>your colleagues are murdering people  And your colleagues are creating a false racial divide that is causing more harm than good. There's no way to prove it but the way police officers get covered in the press has likely lead to the deaths of both us and civilians because of the unwarranted fear of us that cause civilians to act a certain way on contacts with us.  Your industry causes fear via the spread of misinformation. You should work to fix that.  And please point me to where I said I'm against a free press. You're putting words in my mouth, which I mean doesn't shock me since deception is y'all's MO. A free press is a necessity, but when there's nothing to keep that free press from presenting their narrative via propoganda and disguising it as facts, that's more dangerous than not having one at all.  I pay no attention to much media outside of the US so it may be different wherever you are, but in the US, these "journalists" (I hate to even use that term because they are a disgrace to journalism) need to be kept in check.  They don't even try to hide it either. You'll read their race baiting articles and then you'll go to their Twitter feed to see exactly how they feel about what they're supposed to be reporting factually about. It's an absolute disgrace, and I along with most other people in this country [have lost any faith or trust me once had in your industry](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trust-in-media-down.php).  Us as police officers are instructed to not even interact with y'all because when we used to, the next thing we'd see as a headline was something we said taken completely out of context. It's seriously a joke. [end]

[start] Don't be a cop then if you actually care about black people. The entire point of your job is to enforce the will of a racist classist institution. If you wanted to help your community but weren't violent and racist you'd have been a firefighter or EMT.    ACAB [end]
[start] You still conspired to steal a drink from a private business,  you asshole.  If you paid for it anyway I would respect you. [end]
[start] Quit your job asshole [end]
[start] Your entire personality is being a cop, shut up for the love of god [end]
[start] Fuck you [end]
[start] \>I'm a white cop  resign  We don't need your crocodile tears here [end]
[start] It's almost... like... she knew..... THAT ONE SHITBAG PIECE OF SHIT NO MATTER WHAT COLOR THAT SHITBAG PIECE OF SHIT IS.... your still doing your job and may live a very friendly life and are kind to others. It's almost like that.... Imagine not having counter racism.. Wait forgot you can't be racist to whities sorry. I'll shut my 28M ass up now :D. Good job OP. [end]
[start] Thats how life should be.  A world without tension and hate. [end]
[start] People have to understand that besides what the media likes to portray Americans are capable or respecting one another. They don’t have to agree with what others are doing but respect goes a long way. [end]
[start] That's really nice :) And about the current situation: I'm poc and my dad (not biological) is a white cop (not in the States though) and I totally agree with you. In general most people are pretty alright and most cops I know are great people and do their job properly but like in any job, there are bad people who just want to hurt others. Mentally, physically or both. I just hope the bad ones get punished harder so poc don't have to be scared of those who are supposed to keep everyone safe. It's a horrifying thought that people still, in 2020, get discriminated against or even killed based on irrelevant things like sex, race etc. Whether in the States, Germany or anywhere else. This really has to change. [end]
[start] ACAB, especially you [end]
[start] What a sweet cashier. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] That is a lovely exchange. It is the minority that have these hateful ignorant beliefs. I’m glad your safe and thank you for keeping others safe. I’m glad she is safe and keeping others well. [end]
[start] Some social media make people think they are lawyers with flawless critical thinking. I'm looking at you, Twitter. Some examples below. [end]
[start] Your voice is needed at a time like this.  Blacks need to know....... [end]
[TITLE] here some bubble wrap for anyone who needs it :) [TITLE]
[start] I’m having a great time with this [end]
[start] This actually made me smile. Did not expect that. I like this. [end]
[start] Erm,  wha..  HOLY SHIT  aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh.... [end]
[start] I enjoyed this, except it lets me pop all but three bubbles but thanks. [end]
[start] Made me feel like magnitude from community- POP POP! [end]
[start] I love this, thank you [end]
[start] This made my morning. Thank you [end]
[start] When I worked at my old job we got a massive shipment of bubble wrap but we didn’t need it so I created a box of small sheets of bubble wrap and I wrote “take as needed” and people actually took them saying they needed that! I Made my day and I made theirs. [end]
[start] Some people are so goddamn clever. UGH! Have an angry but amused upvote, OP. :D [end]
[start] Why is this strangely hard [end]
[start] What is this sourcery? [end]
[start] How come this isn't in hot yet. The world needs to know about this [end]
[start] Need more [end]
[start] You are gift to humanity [end]
[start] You can UNPOP the bubblessss!! [end]
[start] Well I was stressed out when I opened this, not anymore!! [end]
[start] Best post on Reddit. Wrap it up, boys, we're done here. [end]
[start] does anyone else feel weird doing this without.. magnitude? [end]
[start] I probably shouldn't have liked that as much as I did... and still am... and probably will later since it's saved... [end]
[start] It won't work for me :( [end]
[start] Okay, not gonna lie, I just sat and 'popped' them all. [end]
[start] I feel like I'm playing Minesweeper.  There's tension.  One of these boxes is going to bite me. [end]
[start] I’m drunk and this is great [end]
[start] I think I love you :’) [end]
[start] Not all heroes wear capes [end]
[start] Thanks it actually worked and distracted me for a bit. Feeling a bit meh [end]
[start] r/bestof [end]
[start] Doesn't do anything for me.  Am I missing something? [end]
[start] Stroke the F5 key on your own keyboard if you would like to refresh your bubble wrap :) [end]
[start] Fucking legend. [end]
[start] Thank you very much, today has been a rough day but this made me smile. Thank you. [end]
[start] I popped mine into the shape of a penis 😎 👍 👌 [end]
[start] hehe i spelled “dick” with it [end]
[start] Wow who knew virtual bubble wrap could be so satisfying. [end]
[start] I'm smiling like a goddamn fool this is amazing thank you so much [end]
[start] Best post I've seen on this website for a looooong time [end]
[start] Hell ya [end]
[start] The ones that don’t pop are annoying, but this is actually super fun [end]
[start] pop and breathe [end]
[start] This is the best thing I've seen all day, thank you kind stranger! [end]
[start] I love the optical illusion you get with this sort of thing :) [end]
[start] HIRE THIS MAN [end]
[start] This. Is. Incredible. [end]
[start] Wasn’t haven’t the best day and this put a huge smile on my face [end]
[start] Wow... You... You are a hero, not the kind we expected, but the kind we needed ! You made my Day ! [end]
[start] I just want to let you know you're an amazingly beautiful person and I love you. [end]
[start] I appreciate the amount of effort this took, and so does my girlfriend [end]
[start] This is way too fun for a bunch of spoiler text [end]
[start] this is the best reddit post ive seen in my entire life [end]
[start] I love it. [end]
[start] You made my day a bit better. Thank you, kind stranger. [end]
[start] This gave me immeasurable joy [end]
[start] This is amazing, got no awards to give you but sure as hell can upvote the heck out of your post for giving me a great time, thanks stranger, hope you have a great week! [end]
[start] My bubble wrap is lagging :( [end]
[start] Thank you. This kinda helps with my stress [end]
[start] Dang this is creative [end]
[start] that is a work of art. [end]
[start] Thank you for this! [end]
[start] Popped em all, was expecting an "i<3u" or something somewhere lol. 10/10 post OP, made my day. Thank you. [end]
[start] You could have rick rolled with the bubble content [end]
[start] Some bubble wrap that doesn’t scare my dog :’) [end]
[start] Thank you :) [end]
[start] Most productive thing I’ve done all year [end]
[start]  😅  Never seen such a thing! [end]
[start] I actually smiled- that’s amazing. Thank you :) [end]
[start] That Diablo clickety feeling [end]
[start] Are you a random popper or a strategical popper? :) [end]
[start] this is great [end]
[start] you truly are a blessing, hope you have a great life OP because you deserve it!! [end]
[start] Thanks:) [end]
[start] Saving this [end]
[start] Hahaha yea, having fun dude, thank you [end]
[start] Even better, it unpops so you can pop it again! [end]
[start] Dang it. 3 of them won’t pop [end]
[start] I have a touch screen laptop. lapPOP [end]
[start] LLOOOOOOOOVVED THIS! [end]
[start] Thank you! [end]
[start] The new ASMR [end]
[start] I actually LOLd! Thanks! [end]
[start] Yay! [end]
[start] Only one pops ☹️ [end]
[start] Amazing. Loved it! [end]
[start] How? [end]
[start] [Magnitude is gonna have a stroke!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyp9Qw12boI) [end]
[start] This is really dumb. But after the day I had it made me happy [end]
[start] I love you thank you [end]

[start] I popped them all but three refuse to pop😡 [end]
[start] I made a bird [end]
[start] I love you [end]
[start] Yep [end]
[start] Is there sound? [end]
[start] obsessed with this [end]
[start] Hehe, thanks. This was relaxing. [end]
[start] Good shit OP.   Can't wait for some dumbass to copy this idea next week. [end]
[TITLE] I don't think my girlfriend knows how attracted I am to her [TITLE]
[start] Never stop telling her. As a female who doesn't take compliments well I know how much it actually means to hear that from the person you love. She may brush it off like it's nothing, but inside it warms her heart. [end]
[start] You don’t get tired of seeing the sunrise :) [end]
[start] I love this. I'm so happy you have that in your life. I relate and it's glorious, at times just looking my partner and going "All mine! YESSSS".  Cherish that woman because even if she doesn't notice every time, it matters. [end]
[start] Just keep telling her :) I feel the same way about my girlfriend, and I tell her everytime :) [end]
[start] (maybe) You should tell her about this, just like you did here. You can leave the ‘I’m not sure if she knows’ part out, I think she knows. But it’s still a really nice way of showing you still love her as much as you did when you 2 got in love, and I’d be suprised if she doesn’t like to hear it. Best of luck for both of you, love is a beautiful thing [end]
[start] Can't say it with words?   &#x200B;  Just eat that ass. She'll get it. [end]
[start] Keep doing that!   My SO of almost 9 years does this almost every day. Whether I'm just emptying the dishwasher or whatever, it's nice to hear that your partner thinks you're attractive. [end]
[start] Marry her brooooo!!!!! [end]
[start] My partner still tells me everyday how pretty he thinks I am, we’ve been together for 4.5 years and I never get tired of it. Don’t stop! [end]
[start] I am so attracted to my partner, he's incredible and I love him. I really like that I wake up much earlier than him, this way, I can just look at him without coming off like a leering Hannibal Lector. I love showing him off to my friends and I am so proud that he is mine.  Kevin if you see this, you are the best and I love you [end]
[start] This thread is melting my heart and making me realize how much I love effin monogamy. It just excites the hell outta me being committed to someone. And having a person you can connect with and who just loves and understands you. [end]
[start] I think she already does believe you, seeing as you two have been together for a few years now, but what do i know i dont have a gf [end]
[start] The thing is we're never going to understand what the other thinks or feels about us, that's why a lot of people love the reassurance when it comes to things like that. To me it's okay that my wife will never understand how I feel about her because I love telling her everyday what she means to me and vice versa. It feels good hearing those things day in and day out (at least for me) because it makes me feel special and that I'm on her mind. Idk how many times my wife has thanked me simply for a compliment I've given her or for making her feel loved and wanted and that shes the only women in the world to me. That's what makes this so special, makes love so special. [end]
[start] Keep saying how you feel, if you feel like you’re repeating too often just a kiss or caress. If you stop, she will notice and miss it. [end]
[start] One of the most wholesome posts I've ever read on the internet. So beautiful. [end]
[start] Definitely keep telling her. My mom has a complex about how she looks because her family growing up would always "point out" how "ugly" she was/is. My dad however thinks my mom is super cute/pretty/beautiful and I do too. Especially when I see photos of her when she was my age (around the time she met my dad), she was just stunning. My dad and I constantly tell her how nice we think she looks, and while she never believes us and still believes what her family said (and my parents have been married for 25+ years now), it's still worth it to us to always tell her. She might never believe it herself but hopefully she'll at least believe that we see her as beautiful. [end]
[start] After 12 years together and 11 years married my husband still says the sweetest things to me. I still admire him as much as the day I met him; the problem for him is my self esteem is next to nothing and I have a hard time taking compliments but as I begin to get to a better place of self acceptance and self care, it really warms my heart. Even though you didn’t say it, I’m sure she felt it. [end]
[start] Me seeing my girlfriend naked for the first time: :0   Me seeing my gf naked for the 592959387492946th time: :0 [end]
[start] This is adorable. I’m awkward and pretty sure I roll my eyes a little every time but nothing makes my day like my husband telling my I’m beautiful when I’m feeling like a gd potato. Just a nice reminder that we don’t always see ourselves super clearly, or like the people who love us do. Keep telling her! [end]
[start] My dad just gave me this advice today:  If you think something about her, just say it.  For example, last week my girlfriend bought some new earrings and I thought, “wow those make the blue in her eyes pop” so I just said it. [end]
[start] awieee [end]
[start] i’m so jealous lmao. my boyfriend is amazing but he just doesn’t compliment me or really flirt at all and it’s a bummer sometimes. [end]
[start] I want this 🥺💛 [end]
[start] What a wonderful man you are to say and think that.... I get compliments all the time from people or men but never matters.... i have such insecurities that i hide myself.... if only my partner would say that to me.... over and over.... always tell her.... she may start to believe it [end]
[start] You’re so cute! Tell her every day how you feel. She may not show it, but it probably totally melts her heart ❤️ [end]
[start] what id give for someone to look at me like this, i just got out of a relationship of 3 years and had a baby with him...he ignored me completely and actually would roast me occasionally and had an addiction to porn so our whole relationship just trashed my confidence and self image. but i’m working on building it back up now that we are separated. he never looked at me like that. wish i’d left sooner but it is what it is. you’re a good man, treat her well and she’ll return the favor [end]
[start] Well said! I understand this feeling completely. Just keep telling her. The romance only dies if you let it. 👍 [end]
[start] This is such a sweet post ❤️ [end]
[start] You’re an absolute gem, I’m crying. I don’t have this with my current partner, he just looks away. It makes me sad. [end]
[start] Your story is exactly like mine, I've been with my girlfriend 4 and a bit years too, 2.5 of those living together, and it is still a treat for me to see her change or when she comes out of the shower without a towel. She tells me the same thing too, "nothing you haven't seen before, soon enough you'll get tired of it" but I don't think that will ever happen. She doesn't believe me when I tell her how gorgeous she is, and I don't think she ever will. I'll never stop telling her though, so it's all good.  Just keep doing what you're doing! [end]
[start] Wife and I been together for 10 years (2 yrs married). I tell her everyday how attractive I am to her. She’s conscious bc she has gained weight over the years (and so have I), but I still find her amazing to look at. I think it’s how our pets look at us too.   That’s awesome you feel that way to your girlfriend. Hope it translates to cuddle time :) [end]
[start] This is so nice what you wrote, I wish she could read it :D You wrote: " I wish I said it to her but she's not one for mushy cute stuff." - I dont know, I would almost bet that she would enjoy this compliment A LOT. If you are sometimes not sure, if she enjoyes that, look at her face and body language after you say that. that could give you some hint, if she appreciates that [end]
[start] Aww, I love this so much ☺️ just keep telling your girl!!! She’s lucky to have someone still feel that way about her even after all this time. [end]
[start] So show or tell her [end]
[start] This is so cute omg thanks for sharing [end]
[start] I just recently realized that my boyfriend doesn't know either and it's super cute, even after 5 years he's still super shy whenever I tell him how handsome he is [end]
[start] Don’t be a fool. Tell your damn girlfriend this every single day. You may not think she’s into to mushy stuff but telling her that isn’t mushy. It might make her feel uncomfortable at first because she’s not used to it. Maybe she doesn’t feel like she deserves to be told that, but she does. [end]
[start] i love this so much gahhh :') [end]
[start] Jaja! You and me feel the same way, maybe one day mine will believe me too or appreciate it more. [end]
[start] Love this!! [end]
[start] ALWAYS TELL HER. Please. Even if you feel like a dork for saying it or think she’s heard it too much. As you get older and your bodies and lives change she won’t ever have to wonder if you still think she’s attractive. She’ll already know and have just that little bit more confidence [end]
[start] Do what I do. Place your hands firmly on her face, put your face an inch from hers and say “I love you baby. I’ll never leave you and you will never leave me”, while staring into her eyes. Don’t blink. Women hate blinking. [end]
[start] Absolutely never stop telling her that. I struggle with body image (especially during quarantine) and it’s honestly SO reassuring that my fiancé will give me those looks when I change, or that he goes out of his way to be affectionate. It’s saved me a good deal of mental stress and anguish. [end]
[start] After reading this, I wish I had a boyfriend hah!  *dreamy eyes* [end]
[start] my bf just looks away lol. but i’m happy so many people have found such amazing partners. [end]
[start] My envy has peaked and I am going to sleep [end]
[start] I’m cry this is beautiful I wish happiness for you both [end]
[start] Tell her all day every day, it will never get old. [end]
[start] This is so wholesome !!! [end]
[start] Honestly, i think everyone is full of shit when they tell me im pretty. But yet I've never been called that in years....sadly.... [end]
[start] This made my morning! [end]
[start] Tell her! I don't go crazy for compliments in general, but I love them from my boyfriend. I was sitting in the garden reading at the weekend, and he came out to tell me I looked really pretty :) it made me feel so cherished. I honestly felt good all day about [end]
[start] [https://www.around009.com/](https://www.around009.com/) [end]
[start] Thats really lovely [end]
[start] Aww this is so cute :) [end]
[start] Why haven't you married her already OP? What are you waiting for? [end]
[start] I hope she reads it ❤️ [end]
[start] So gay. [end]
[start] Huh, in my experience putting women on pedastles or feeling an imbalance in attractiveness leads to bad things [end]
[TITLE] If pooping in front of someone was my fetish I'd be having a great time right now cos there's a builder outside my 2nd floor toilet window and I don't have curtains but it's not my fetish and I'm not having a good time. [TITLE]
[start] I work in construction. It's okay to just tell him to fuck off for a sec so you can poop. [end]
[start] That is the single best way you could have phrased this. [end]
[start] Sir, i needs to check inside ya esshole [end]
[start] Maybe hang up a towel with some thumb tacks real quick? Also, what if this is their fetish, and they think they just hit the jackpot? 😂 [end]
[start] I’m sorry that you’re dealing with this, but it made me laugh and you made my day. So, thank you :) [end]
[start] Don’t worry, animals poop with an audience all the time. My male rabbit poops just for pooping’s sake. [end]
[start] While I feel your pain, I can only poop while naked, so it could be worse. [end]
[start] r/evenwithcontext [end]
[start] You’d also be at home at a boarding school. I kid you not, we used to crap in teams. If you had any modesty boarding school pretty much strips it from you with a heavy duty scraper. [end]
[start] Oh god. I briefly dated someone in Paris who had massive windows in his flat and one morning as we are up to some funny business we look over and there’s a man just doing his job cleaning windows whilst hoisted on scaffold 😩 I wasn’t worried since he was on like the ninth or tenth floor but sure enough- there he was. [end]
[start] extra sheet or towel seems like a good idea [end]
[start] I doubt they’ve really seen you. Keep pooping OP. [end]
[start] This gets wilder with every word [end]
[start] Make intense eye contact the whole time to assert your dominance. [end]
[start] This is why I follow this sub. [end]
[start] Lmao reading this made me burst out laughing [end]
[start] Another builder here. I often find myself in a position where I am stood in front of a window holding or passing up things and it so awkward. I can't look away cos I have to stand in just the right way to reach. But I don't want to be gorping through someone's (usually bathroom) window. I'm more than happy to change the work plan so the person in the house can do the stuff they need. I'd prefer it to be honest I'd rather change a few things than have the customer unhappy with my job. [end]
[start] This made my day 😂 [end]
[start] Lmao [end]
[start] Duct tape your shower curtain temporarily over the window until the builder is gone [end]
[start] Ha ha ha ha!! Such a funny post!! [end]
[start] Just smile and wave.  🤗👋 [end]
[start] I just watched a video on another sub of a high school fight in a bathroom. The two combatants end up busting into the handicap stall where some poor ginger kid is trying to take a shit. Hilarity ensues. [end]
[start] 😂 [end]
[start] 'cause [end]
[start] Make sure he doesn't leave his [bike](https://youtu.be/wP24yiSxWEA) in your flat [end]
[start] A friend of mine was getting a new roof on her house.  Both bathrooms have skylights and those dudes were up there all day.  I told her to make a blanket fort over the potty but she went to her mom's to do the deed.  Much sympathy for the lack of privacy! [end]
[start] Sometimes you have to put some work in to make something a fetish, start small maybe a few close friends.im sure in no time you will be pooping on the subway, I'm rotting for you op [end]
[start] pics or it did not happen [end]
[start] Maybe tape some paper over your window? Let's the light in, but peeping eyes out. [end]
[start] Get some damn curtains already!!! Lol [end]
[start] Why not tack up some towels or a sheet for privacy? [end]
[TITLE] Did you know you can't breathe while smiling? [TITLE]
[start] You got me [end]
[start] Oh, you silly person, you! [end]
[start] Got me to smile, but I also look like a psychopath cause I tested it by breathing heavily instead of normally. [end]
[start] JK I just wanted to make you breathe. [end]
[start] oh youuUUUU you got me  >:) [end]
[start] I don’t get it. [end]
[start]  :) Got me too.. and I laughed :D [end]

[start] GG WP [end]
[start] Totally got me. I smile almost all day everyday. Ty 🤗 [end]
[start] This is great for a date! Thank you so much [end]
[start] OP, did you know you can hear a smile?  If you are all alone, and go from bland, "I don't care" to a big smile, there's a little sound, your cheeks separating or something.  This was done as a group activity when I went caving once.  The instructor had everyone sit down, lights out, and then count to three in your head and then smile.  Sure enough, everyone heard the noise times 10 and we all started laughing. [end]
[start] Love u [end]
[start] This is cute hhhhh [end]
[start] You clever goose you XD [end]
[start] I read that and felt like I couldn't breathe. [end]
[start] I just tested it [end]
[start] Lies and slander [end]
[start] Just because I knew what you were doing, doesn't mean it didn't work [end]
[start] I don’t know what to think of reddit anymore [end]
[start] Take it, take it you monster [end]
[start] I totally fell for it [end]
[start] i needed this today 🥺 [end]
[start] Someone once said you can’t breathe while humming...I accused her of never giving a blow job... [end]
[start] Thanks for making me breathe! [end]
[start] I thought maybe it wasn’t working since My smile was fake 😆 [end]
[start] Hmm I read smelling [end]
[start] I’m very pleased. [end]
[start] My first smile today.. thank you... :) [end]
[start] gross [end]
[start] Thank god I read the body text, I was ready with my defence point saying " I lived my entire life in a coffin" until then. [end]
[start] Lies Source I just tried. [end]
[start] Omg u got meeee [end]
[start] Be careful, don't let all this power go to your head [end]
[start] Ok. You got me. Then I smiled again because you got me. You got me twice. Thank you! [end]
[start] I was like “watch me prove you wrong” *does the creepiest grin ever* // *realizes I just got bamboozled* [end]
[start] Nice try jerk I'm not smiling for anyone. [end]
[start] :O [end]
[start] You made me smile, but it wasn't a pleasant one. Probably looked like Jeff the Killer. [end]
[start] Haha! Thanks for this! I needed it. :D [end]
[start] You trickster! [end]
[start] Awww you [end]
[start] I was about to respond with a dumb joke, but now I'm actually smiling. You wholesome mouth breather you. [end]
[start] Im in hospital right now and i feel kinda stupid for  smiling because of this lmao [end]
[start] I would of collapsed two decades ago lol [end]
[start] hahaha I love it :) [end]
[start] I knew this trick but still smiled [end]
[start] Hah, can't trick me! I don't even have a mouth, just a Reddit using finger. [end]
[start] Dammit!!! Lol thanks though! [end]
[start] Thanks [end]
[start] Lol got me! [end]
[start] you made me look like a psychopath for a sec, thnx i guess [end]
[start] I knew the exact purpose of this and I not only smiled I had a chuckle too, thanks! [end]
[start] fuck [end]
[start] Nice one :) [end]
[start] You silly goose ya got me [end]
[start] good, I never smile [end]
[start] I want a refund. [end]
[start] Just got arrested. Dont do this outside of the preschool [end]
[start]  "A SMILE BRINGS FORTH ENERGY IN YOUR LIFE GIVING YOU FORCE!"   name that band [end]
[start] Well, reverse psychology would have worked on me, you got me to attempt to frown while breathing! :( [end]
[start] Lol I just tried so yeah, you got me :) [end]
[start] Great now I look like a psychopath and everyone in the airport is looking at me [end]
[start] I have a fucked depressed mind that forced me to think about it and I haven't smiled. Good try though [end]
[start] Now this one... This one got me for sure. [end]
[start] Got me, that's good. [end]
[start] Dammit man (: [end]
[start] Thank you OP! [end]
[start] Thanks for the smile today :) [end]
[start] Haha awwww [end]
[start] Success! [end]
[start] Not even close. [end]
[start] Actually you can but you don't [end]
[start] Funny things make me smile, next time you want to achieve that,!try funny. [end]
[start] You can breathe through your nose. [end]
[TITLE] Attention websites: If you make me login with a Facebook account and leave no other option, I will filter your site and never return again.  [TITLE]
[start] Websites seem to think that I won't be belligerent if I log in with my facebook account.  They underestimate the wrath of someone with no co-workers as friends.  [end]
[start] Looking at you spotify. This is why I have the ad muter, and not the subscription.  [end]
[start] Also, if you make me create a login for your website without obvious reason to do so (like the Washington Post, for instance), I will leave once told I have to sign in. [end]
[start] It is annoying as hell. Last night a couple of friends begged me to check out their socialcam site. I download the app (android) and the only option is to log in with facebook. No thanks, uninstall. Cant fathom how having this as the only login option is a good business decision. [end]
[start] I also refrain from rampant Facebookery.  I am constantly harassed by friends and family like they are drug pushers.  "You should try it, I know you'd like it. It's free. Everyone else is doing it.  You don't want to be the only one NOT doing it, do you?"      [end]
[start] Attention OP, websites don't care.  There are enough people with no concern for their privacy that will use the Facebook login, that the few of us who reject that method don't matter to the site. [end]
[start] Especially with how easily Facebook disables accounts. From the website owner's perspective, you don't want to leave your visitors' access to your website in someone else's hands. [end]
[start] They know.  You're worth more when you login with Facebook. They don't want you without it. So, they're basically saying "No Facebook? Bugger off! Not interested in your business!" [end]
[start] What annoys me the most is that when I'm trying to apply for a job and I have to create an account with them they want me connect it with facebook. Fuck that. I would definitely not get hired if I did. [end]
[start] Especially if it then wants to post that I'm using the site/service. Forget that.  [end]
[start] And if you use an ad that plays sound automatically, I will never revisit the site either. [end]
[start] Agreed. When I deleted my Facebook at the end of high school a few years ago my productivity has sky rocketed, I am less stressed and I actually stay in touch with a lot of friends. Facebook sucks balls. [end]
[start] Question:  Would you rather create a new account as a one off for that site? As someone that builds a lot of large websites for famous brands, this is something that often comes up.  1. People hate signing up for new websites. It's also a bit of work to create a new log in system for a site that might only have a shelf life of 6 months  2. Ask people to use their Facebook. That way they can get into the experience quicker, and the drop off when you ask people to create new accounts is high. Also, if you are a bit savvy, you ca turn off all the sharing options so nothing will ever show up on your profile.  3. I do totally agree with you that when you just want to read an article or something that someone posted on Facebook and they ask you to connect your Facebook before you read it, i want to punch a baby in the face  Would love to hear what everyone else thinks [end]
[start] seconded. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] That is what my only Facebook profile, a fake one is for. Just remember to uncheck that option to remember you. [end]
[start] I signed on to fakebook as part of the Digital Media Production course I was doing. I dropped out of the course and deleted my account as the course was all about manipulation of Social Media to further a company's web presence and profile.  It was an interesting course but the things the lecturers told us about modern technology and the infringement into an individuals' life and the possible consequences have turned me into a bit of a Luddite: facial mood/race recognition software, digital skin patents, digital DNA mapping and tracking by mobile phone (or other devices).  Brave new world? Sorry, I want no part of it. [Bill Hick's link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?)v=gDW_Hj2K0wo) [end]
[start] Right click -> Inspect Element with Firebug   Right click on element in Firebug -> Delete Element    It probably takes me longer and is more hassle than it's worth but if a website puts an unmoveable cover over the page like that then I stubbornly remove the cover and read the damn article anyway (normally that kind of 'you must log in' thing is just an overlay and the proper page content is underneath) [end]
[start] Fuck yes. [end]
[start] anonymity will be intolerated. [end]
[start] Fucking spotify [end]
[start] Yes, Fuck that shit.   [end]
[start] Thank gawd I'm not the only one!! [end]
[start] This also goes for anything that comes between me and the content I want to see. Popups, surveys, anything. That shit shows up and I'm gone for good. [end]
[start] Totally agree. Makes the site seem like part of Facebook instead of a real website.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I actually prefer it when they ask me to login with Facebook. So much easier, and they don't get your password. [end]
[start] I don't want to login with anything [end]
[start] Strangely, I don't mind using Twitter though. Probably because they feel far more trustworthy. [end]
[start] I don't have a facebook. These sites are actively discriminating against me. Someone give me a word for this.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I don't use facebook because... basically I don't give a shit about ever detail of your life any more than you give a shit about mine.  Want to see where facebook will be in a few years... lets look to our past to see our future:  http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-february-15-2006/trendspotting---social-networking  Wow, lets all jump on that myspace train, it will last forever. [end]
[start] For this exact reason I never did find out who won in the Epic Rap Battles of History. [end]
[start] I'm with you there. I don't like Facebook anyway. I just got back from seeing David Byrne and Carrie Brownstein give a talk ... and there were two people in front of me Facebooking . I wanted to grab their phones and toss them over the balcony.  [end]
[start] Unfortunately, (and I mean this non-sarcastically), they've already accounted for you, and assumed they could get enough users from fb who don't give a shit. [end]
[start] thankyouwank.com needs you to do this. .then you tell it about all your facebook friends that you've fapped to. [end]
[start] When services require you to login with facebook and post a status, when that permissions window comes up, you can set it to "Only me" so NO one else sees your spam, but you still get the coupon code or whatever it is you're trying to get, then just delete the status and app. [end]
[start] We have a second - all those in favor indicate with an Aye.  .......  I believe the vote carries.  Sites who force authentification with facebook and leave no other option are run by cunt nuggets and will no longer be visited by us. [end]
[start] My site uses Mozilla's Persona.  **IF** it were the only option to log into my site (which it's not, I'm just asking) would that one be acceptable or would it also invoke the leave, filter, and never return behavior? [end]
[start] Oh noooo! not the filter! [end]
[start] Attention websites: If you make me login with Facebook to comment, my browser extensions have already filtered half your functionality and I can't even see your useless fucking comments section. [end]
[start] This works for me. [end]
[start] Which is why I will never use Spotify. [end]
[start] You gotta leave facebook. [end]
[start] You get my upvote for that [end]
[start] I don't filter the site nor flag it, but I definitely click on the red [X] [end]
[start] It's just marketing.  There are more people that will blindly do it than there are people who protest it and leave.  Just a numbers game. [end]
[start] As far as I know Livestrong does this. [end]
[start] Give us back the good old email registration. [end]
[start] Related note - most sites offer a way to unlink your FB account if you change your mind about being signed in through FB at a later date. [end]
[start] Same here. I don't use spotify because I don't want to log in with my facebook.  Just because I have facebook doesn't mean I want you to know who I am or any other details about my life. [end]
[start] But why? [end]
[start] Pretty much, yeah. [end]
[start] Facebook as one option for logging in isn't bad, but the problem is that the site shows your full name, not just username and often FB is the only option. I have unique name and special FB account for web services and apps. When I don't tell my passport name even to people I meet several times in physical life, then why should I do it online? Even FB could show usernames to everybody who are not our friends. Any site that shows users full names, is meant for professional use and people can't express themselves freely or they will have trouble in the future. Especially when you have very uncommon name. People who join online services don't have to think constantly what impression they can give to potential employers. What kind of music should they listen or what comments leave on 9gag. [end]
[start] this. [end]
[start] You still have Facebook? [end]
[start] w3rd [end]
[start] As a website, I apologize... Wait. I am not a website. I am a user ON a popular website that doesn't force you to login with Facebook... Why are you telling me this story? [end]
[start] Not to disagree, but was it okay when Google and Yahoo implemented it years before? [end]
[start] I love that option.  It's easier than making a username, password, and having to confirm my email. [end]
[start] Attention OP - Millions of others will simply login with their Facebook account, and the website will generate the exact same revenue. You're making literally zero difference.   I agree with you, but you're just being an attention whore about it.  [end]
[start] "We don't give a fuck about you then"  --All those websites, and me too. [end]
[start] I disagree. I would rather not create another account. [end]
[start] Good for you. They wouldn't do it if it didn't work. [end]
[start] Meh, yeah, in principle. Although I personally just make all the third-party apps on my facebook set to private, so even if they publish something, nobody sees it. It's clunky but I don't really mind. I like the ability to connect with people on facebook, even if I don't like some of the ways people exploit it. [end]
[start] While I see your point, I think using Facebook JUST for login purposes is a win-win situation: you don't have to remember one extra password and the company doesn't have to worry about loosing your password. Actually they are both wins for the user too, since they have better security of their passwords (which frankly most users have probably just one and use it in every site). But sadly sites often exploit this and ask for more permissions (like posting to your wall) than necessary.  I'm planning to make a web-app and am thinking of Facebook login only (takes a hell of worries off my head). But I will try to make it explicitly clear that it will be used only for log in purposes which is only good for everyone. Will that change your mind? (Yes, I am concerned, I don't want to loose any potential users!) [end]
[start] Not trying to start an e-argument.. but why?  This is the ever-so-popular opinion, but I am apathetic, well as long as it's not posting a ton of shit on my wall. That part I understand. [end]
[start] SO BRAVE [end]
[start] I find it highly convenient, actually. [end]
[start] I feel the same way, but my two exceptions were Khan Academy and Livestrong. [end]
[start] Website developer/maintainer here. Handling users' logins is the most annoying and frustrating part of running a website. Using third-party login services is often the best possible solution to it and Facebook is most widely used. When I add 3rd party I also include Twitter & Google but ultimately at least as many users are annoyed when they have to create a new login/password when going to a website. [end]
[start] I like it when I don't need to make an account. A lot of those indie giveaways let you use facebook now. [end]
[start] Attention sleeper141: Don't worry there are plenty of other retards out there!  Love, websites that only leave you the option to sign in with Facebook. [end]
[start] They'll probably forgo all that money so that you, sleeper141, will go to their website. [end]
[start] This is a pretty stupid thing to be pissed about. It's actually super convenient to be able to use a single login with a bunch of services. You don't need to use or support Facebook to have a Facebook account. You're only making things harder for yourself by being a baby about it.  [end]
[start] I prefer it because i dont have to make yet another account, another password etc for another account. [end]
[start] literally nobody making these sites cares. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] no website wants sniveling pieces of shit like you so it's a win win [end]
[TITLE] I just got accepted into Juilliard! [TITLE]
[start] Remember: relationships, relationships, relationships.  Performing Arts (assuming that's what you're going for), all the technique in the world won't feed you, unless you can market yourself.  Make sure you graduate with a close group of friends you are comfortable collaborating with.  Start a nfp or a company as soon as possible, and publish as much online as you can while you are studying.  Build your platform now, while you have access to the facilities and support from colleagues and staff.  Your future may depend upon it, when that support drops out. [end]
[start] That’s an accomplishment to be proud of! [end]
[start] Hey I don’t know what Juilliard is, but it seems very important to you! Big congratulations 🥳! [end]

[start] Congrats! It’s a big deal in the music world. Will be starting next fall? Best wishes and I hope you make meaningful connections there [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Can anyone apply. What are the requirements? [end]
[start] I didn’t know what Julliard was until about 3 seconds ago when I scrolled down, good job, what are you gonna be? [end]
[start] Hell yeah good for you holmes [end]
[start] Wow how amazing! Congrats!!! [end]
[start] Enjoy and learn lots! [end]
[start] Wow. That's amazing. You must be exceptional talented! You deserve to be proud! 💓 [end]
[start] Wow! CONGRATS!! I hope you do wonderful things! [end]
[start] Congratulations!!!! Love seeing the good news! [end]
[start] Now you're going to have to start watching movies like raise your voice, and August Rush! [end]
[start] That’s an amazing accomplishment in itself. Enjoy and work hard.   Also, as another poster suggested, nothing is more important than networking in the industry. Be reliable, be cool to hang around and with some luck, things will fall into place.   Congratulations and Good luck!! [end]
[start] Congrats! I don’t know much, but I’ve heard about this school on tv shows and movies. I’m assuming you’re an extremely talented and hard working individual who earned it. Even if you just lucked into it, congrats! I’m proud of you. Keep up the good work. [end]
[start] Huuuuge congrats to you, please remember your skill is important, as is relationships. Network, Get a Linked In, practice selling yourself and your qualities while minimizing your weaknesses. Again, HUGE congrats! [end]
[start] Yay! Congratulations! [end]

[start] Congratulations! [end]
[start] Congratulations buddy. Keep achieving your dreams. [end]
[start] Good job!!!! [end]
[start] I am very proud of you! I wish you all the happiness and success [end]
[start] Congratulations! That’s amazing! Take every single networking, business, and creative opportunity you have to build a portfolio and a network of people who can connect you with future work opportunities. [end]
[start] Congratulations!  Be proud of your hard work. [end]
[start] Congratulations! [end]
[start] Congratulations! That’s an amazing achievement OP [end]
[start] Congratulations! What's your craft? [end]
[start] Congratulations .. success is waiting [end]
[start] I am SO happy for you. It really just makes me happy to read this. I am a musician myself and know what an achievement that is. Go kill it! [end]
[start] Be  GREAT 👍 [end]
[start] That’s wonderful, congratulations! Have an amazing time there and you have a bright future ahead! [end]
[start] I also want to go to Juilliard and learn how to act, was it hard to get in? What is it like? Sorry so many questions but that’s my dream! And are you in performing arts(idk if that’s acting or singing sorry) ? And I’m not from US so it might be impossible for me to get in and study acting [end]
[start] Brother went there. Make connections, having the name on the resume will only get you so far [end]
[start] That's an incredible accomplishment. I knew a guy at the Curtis Institute, so I have some idea what qualifications you have. All the best. [end]
[start] That’s so exciting! Huge congratulations to you. Another tip, don’t be shy about reaching out to alumni that graduated from your program to make connections. Ask your advisor who would be a good person to talk to/ would be willing take the time to sit down with you and answer your questions. I read an article once that essentially said people are willing to help you climb the ladder professionally from 18-29, after that you’re competition and people will be less willing to help you! Take advantage of this time. [end]
[start] That's fantastic. Congratulations! [end]
[start] With 2020 being a shit show! Im glad you got good news!! Congratulations 🎉🎉 [end]
[start] This is so wonderful!! Congratulations on a well earned acceptance! [end]
[start] What an accomplishment!! Congrats! [end]
[start] Congrats!!! What's your specialty? [end]
[start] Also what do you think of the movie "Billy Elliot" (it's one of my favorites)? [end]
[start] As long as you dont tweet it and say suck my dick to the dean them youre good.  From someone whos an amputee in music, aka cant hold a note or carry a tune, congrats. [end]
[start] Let’s gooooo I was so happy when I got into film school so I can somewhat relate, happy you’re happy [end]

[start] Retail is rough. It sucks worse with a high overturn rate and having to deal with new idiots over and over again. [end]

[start] I am so proud of you! You deserve everything you have worked for and I hope you find the time to develop new friendships in you new home! Having people to share your success with is important. [end]
[start] That's great man. Getting out of poverty is extremely hard (I know this first hand sadly, and fucked up my opportunities in the past). [end]
[start] Congrats!! If you ever need anyone in Miami lmk :) [end]
[start] Hey man, you don't need to give me silver. I'm just happy that you are. [end]

[start] Heck ya 🙏🏻 [end]
[start] So proud of you! Go get it! [end]

[start] Congrats :) & welcome to Miami [end]
[start] Great news and good for you. Hard work pays off! [end]
[start] Thank you so much for the silver ☺️ [end]
[start] Congratulations! Isn’t it amazing what you can become in spite of where you come from? You did this all on your own. You can literally accomplish anything! Set your goals high and believe in yourself. I believe in you. [end]
[start] Wonderful things happen for ppl that are persistent, positive, strong and driven. Enjoy your reward for all your hard work and KNOWING that you deserve good things from this life. CONGRATULATIONS!!! [end]
[start] You go girl!! I literally did a happy squeal for you. You got this [end]
[start] Have a pro mechanic look at it. Any kind of honest seller will have no problem agreeing to that. If you’re U.S., check the CarFax. Google the seller.   I’m a professional Mom (not just mine, but their friends), so I can offer all kinds of info and advice. Just let me know! [end]
[start] Thanks! When buying used vehicles from a dealership always take it to a mechanic. Our dealership encourages it for peace of mind so if the dealership says no then they’re probably hiding something. Obviously used cars won’t be perfect but you’ll at least have an idea of what you’re dealing with. If you finance, make sure they know what they’re doing and don’t send your info to a ton of banks that pull your credit each time. [end]
[start] I am very proud of you!! Everybody here is so proud of you! You did this and you deserve this. Best of luck to you! [end]
[start] Congratulations, remember to save some you can though in case bad times/emergencies and what not! [end]

[start] Congrats! [end]
[start] Congratulations !! You deserve it !! May the force continue to be with you!! :) [end]
[start] You deserve the biggest congratulations anyone can give. Retail is so hard, everywhere. I'm in New Zealand and it's definitely the same here, and I've been in it for a while now (15+ years). What you have achieved in your short time is amazing. You've overcome a hard upbringing and difficulties that a weaker person would not get past, to show all.of us that with determination and a mindset of getting what you want, that is is possible. I'm so proud of you for getting the job and sending you the biggest congratulatory hug and high five I can from. Well done, and keep moving onward and upward. You deserve it. [end]
[start] Congratulations!!! It must have been super hard escaping the poverty cycle! Super proud of you! [end]
[start] That’s great news! Sometimes you have to take a second to realize how fortunate you are to be a positive person after all that.  I hope u dont have road rage.. the drivers really suck down here. Lol [end]
[start] This is when suddenly a random person in the works can make you feel proud, wish you the best of luck, keep moving forward and pushing your limits, you're awesome! [end]

[start] This proves that anyone can do anything you can go from dirt poor to filthy rich I have a saying I tell this to myself every day that saying is "live life to the fullest live your life the way you want to you are the one who shapes your future." Carpe diem my Friend [end]

[start] Man thats great! Congrats~~ [end]
[start] Nice job and good luck.  I can relate because I'm a self-made rich man. I started out from a poor family too but not drugs or anything we just all worked regular jobs and then I started a business and then another and another and then I retired early but I started a new business as part of my so-called "retirement" because I love work so much and I love extra piles of money too.  "Keep on truckin' " as the old saying goes (Eddie Kendricks song too lol...)  You'll just keep getting better!  +1 point for you. Good luck in your manager job!  🎩 [end]
[start] I'm so, so proud of you! Enjoy your success! :D [end]

If you were my grandchild, I would be bursting with pride and telling everyone I met about how smart, brave and hardworking you are.  How do I know from your story that you are all of those? You would have to be, to get where you are.  Now go to your new assignment with confidence, you have earned it and would not have the job if you hadn't and management knows that. [end]

[TITLE] I spent the first few minutes of 2019 unconscious in a hospital after a failed suicide attempt on NYE. This year I kissed my boyfriend that I will be marrying in 2020 and took a shot with my sister. Staying alive is hard but worth it. [TITLE]
[start] I tried to commit suicide this new ears eve but was stopped by my best friend (my ex). As unhappy as I am now, I believe it happened for a reason, so I'm trying to focus on what good 2020 will hopefully bring to me. [end]
[start] >Staying alive is hard but worth it.  ~~Here, here.~~ Hear, hear. Literally been my mindset for the past year.  Good to hear you made it, and congratulations. 🥂  &#x200B;  **EDIT:** My dumb ass was so tired after staying up all night on New Year's that it not only misspelled a concurring cheer but also ***completely forgot about the edit button.*** [end]
[start] I was the same, spent January in-between hospital and psych wards because of a bad suicide attempt. I ended 2019 with my three best friends surrounding me, kissed my boyfriend who has done nothing but love me these past years, and I've never been as glad I'm still here. Life is hard but it really is worth it once the bad stuff is done [end]
[start] This made me happy! Cheer to you :) [end]
[start] Wow congrats on turning your life around. Thanks for sharing with us. All the best to your marriage. [end]
[start] Love [end]
[start] This is wonderful news!!! So incredibly happy for you. All the best for the wedding! [end]
[start] I didn't see the sub and by the way it started I thought it was an AMA haha.  Also, congratulations :) [end]
[start] I dunno how you do it... Waking up everyday knowing that today is just going to be like yesterday... Tbh, i have no hope left in me even though everything in my life is going good, i just can't seem to smile [end]
[start] "Feeling Good - The New Mood Therapy" by David Burns, MD.  In print for >20 years. Recommended to me by my therapist. The very first chapter answered an important question that I didn't, and *wouldn't be likely* to ask that question anytime soon. I ended up freeing myself of some nasty stuff. I didn't have any expectations, and the effectiveness of Burns' work is undeniable, to me and others, apparently.  I despise self-help books. I find them to be the long version of one of the following: "Take advantage of a semi-special standing or privilege, and make bucks and bucks!!" or, alternately, "First, pull yourself up by the hair.", where the opening chapter is spent establishing that this book is *not* for you..."  It's in the lie-berry, prolly. [end]
[start] 👏🏻👏🏻 [end]
[start] I’m so happy to hear this. Thank you for sharing! [end]
[start] ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ [end]
[start] I very much agree with this post! When you’re in the shit you can’t help but only see what’s in front of you! It’s not even your fault it’s just how it is. But over time you’ll rise above it and it gets easier.      Congrats on a year well lived! [end]
[start] Last year around this time I was homeless and addicted to prescription painkillers. This year I have my own place, I'm engaged, and I have a daughter on the way. If I had killed myself like I wanted to last year I would have missed out on all of this.   It gets better if you put in the work. [end]
[start] Yaaaassss! Good for you. [end]
[start] Yes! Thank you for sharing this epic win [end]
[start] Glad you are here with us living your best life. This world would not be the same without. #LoveAll2020 [end]
[start] I attempted suicide four times in my life before April 19th, 1987, unsuccessfully, thank God! Today, I have been sober for 32 years, and I am happier than I have ever been in my entire life. Each year is better and better, exceeding even my wildest dreams! I'm so happy for you that you are alive and have a chance at a life like I have. [end]
[start] I started the last decade off finding out my husband didn’t love me anymore, then getting in a major car wreck resulting in a spinal fusion. After I healed up, I went to my hometown (500 miles away) without a plan. A couple dudes I met (friends of friends) invited me to crash on their couch while I figured it out. They became some of the best friends I’ve ever had. They helped me find a great job and my own place, but let me keep a key so I could come crash whenever I wanted. I did almost every night. They cock blocked every guy they thought was bad for me. I even had to get a domestic violence restraining order against someone and they took PTO to go to all my court dates with me.  This time I spent New Years surrounded by my family, friends and my boyfriend of 3 years. When we kissed at midnight he cried tears of joy. And then we spent all of New Year’s Day with our friends getting pampered at a god damn luxury spa and eating fancy French food. [end]
[start] I’m really happy for you :) [end]
[start] Happy for you [end]
[start] Yeah, It can be hard but it's also the most rewarding. Congrats on what you achieved in a single year! Most people couldn't. [end]
[start] Hope 2020 brings you context for your past pain & frustration in a way that helps you know deeply that you're competent to handle life's hills, valleys, mountains, rivers & oceans.  It's all part of the human experience. [end]
[start] Congratulations and the best in the new year. I am a boring person because I learned nothing is as bad, or as good, as it seems. Nothing is so bad that it can not be overcome. Nothing is so good as to be perfect. Life is much easier if you keep yourself in between those bounds. [end]
[start] Sometimes the mind can be the hardess thing to battle. You've got this!  Cheers to new years and new memories! It's not always going to be easy but just know you will always have a reason to be here, you may not know why.... But you do. May you have a wonderful year filled with love and laughter. ❤ Best wishes to you! [end]
[start] Did she kiss back? [end]
[start] Proud of you, you overcame the challenging times and happy where you are now! Happy holidays ✨ [end]
[start] Sounds like a nice adventure. [end]
[start] AMAZING [end]
[start] How was the process of psychological recovery after that attempt? I’m feeling very suicidal lately and I’m really looking for solutions to that [end]
[start] Go, you! You got this. All good things in 2020! [end]
[start] Hang in there buddy. You got this. We believe in you! You are stronger than ever. [end]
[start] That’s wonderful!  Congratulations on turning your life around! [end]
[start] This is nice to hear and very glad you are doing well.  However please make serious investments in your mental health while you’re able to and while things are good. So many people are able to push away serious mental health issues when their life is going well, only for them to come crashing back when life hits a bump. If you have the means, face some of those old issues, and maybe see a therapist, even if you don’t feel you need it now. [end]
[start] Staying alive. Staying alive. Hard hard hard hard.  But we are still here. [end]
[start] Glad someone had a good start to 2020.  I got broken up with [end]
[start] I am SO glad you are here still!!! [end]
[start] I tried to kill myself during the summer of 2019 and was put in inpatient. The worst week of my life but I got to spend another new year eve with my boyfriend who love me more than anything.  Sometimes you just have to hold on a little longer. [end]
[start] I also tried to commit suicide at 4am on 12/31 about 15 years ago. Not sure why I chose that date, but I hated how I had to re-remember it every year during the holiday. Still here, doing well now. [end]
[start] Back in California, I was riding the Metrolink one day. The whole train was stopped because someone jumped in front of it a short while before we approached. The conductor said something like suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. The train was allowed to pass after they covered the body up. There were tarps on both sides of the train.  The problem with suicide is that it's a total response (mental, physical, and spiritual) to a conflict supported by a temporary frame of reference on a fleeting timeline. You're boyfriend/girlfriend broke up with you? In a month you'll be fine. A favorite pet died? You'll get over it.   The human body does well mostly on its own. It's only when we start throwing trash into the fire (exaggerated emotions, bad recollections, poor response to negative people, etc.) does it grow. [end]
[start] Congratulations! [end]
[start] Congrats on your engagement! Hope 2020 is an amazing year for you! [end]
[start] I am so glad you decided to stay! Have a good life! [end]
[start] Hell yeah, you go OP! [end]
[start] Thank you for posting this. I considered it yesterday. [end]
[start] Makes me hopeful :) congrats! [end]
[start] So does that mean if i put myself in the hospital now my next boyfriend won't ghost me after the first date? [end]
[start] I am likely to die this year. It’s good to see that other people are getting out though [end]
[start] While im glad for you your entirely anecdotal statement is not always true. [end]
[start] Wish I believed you, I'm sure you understand why I don't. Thank you though [end]
[start] I'm glad you're here. ❤️ [end]
[start] I'm proud of you for hanging in there! I hope you have a great 2020 and a happy marriage ❤️ [end]

[TITLE] At the age of 25, I finally drove a car alone. [TITLE]
[start] I just had my first driving lesson at the age of 27 about an hour ago! I had all the same fears and anxieties you mentioned and a guy I was seeing even dumped me once because I lied about being able to drive. I was so embarrassed that I couldn't drive I would lie or find a reason to leave the room too. I felt like my license was the only thing keeping me back from fully being an adult but my fear of failure overtook me. I feel so confident after my first lesson and I hope you enjoy your newfound freedom!!   [end]
[start] Well done!!! [end]
[start] Hey I’m 33 and I just got my learners this year (it’s actually the 3rd time but the only time over ever actually learned to drive). Won’t be taking my test until next spring so still haven’t drove alone!   Good job!  [end]
[start] Must be an american thing I guess. In europe, many people age and die without driving a vehicle even once.  I'm 25 and I don't really plan on getting a license anytime soon. Well, a skydiving license maybe :P [end]
[start] I was always afraid of hitting someone so I just walked, biked, and used public transportation.  Then I got married, moved to Northern California and had our son and realized that it just wasn't efficient to walk a mile to and from  the grocery store with a backpack of food on my back and strolling the one year old.  So my husband taught me how to drive and my life has changed forever.   I grew up in L.A. and never drove until I went back to visit with my kid.    My advice is... stay active even though you drive now.    It's really easy to gain weight when you stop walking from place to place.    Congratulations on your license and your "drive" to learn. [end]
[start] Congratulations that is so awesome!!  I'm 23 and I don't have my license yet. My parents didn't support me learning when I was teen, so I had no one to teach me for years. I finally took lessons about 6 months ago, and I practiced with my boyfriend a lot, but when I finally got up the courage to take the test I failed because of a stupid mistake (someone cut me off in a construction zone, I was distracted and missed a stop sign :p) and all my anxiety came back. It took me months to start practicing again, I just started last week. I'm really not a bad driver but I still feel like I'll never pass now  &#x200B;  It's really awesome to hear a story about someone getting their liscense late in life, makes me feel less alone. I totally feel you on the lying to people about driving thing, it's stressful as hell to feel behind [end]
[start] Shitty life pro tip- Tell people you used to suffer from minor seizures and you just passed the timeframe with out a seizure so you can finally learn to drive. Then thank modern medicine.   They’ll feel like dicks.  [end]
[start] I'm 34 and failed my road test last week! I choked and made a dumb mistake.  I just started learning to drive in the summer but will probably wait until spring to try again because I'm too scared to drive in the winter.  [end]
[start] Congratulations!!!  I was about 26 when I drove by myself - mainly due to anxiety on the road. I had an asshole instructor too - once he started yelling at me, and I started crying (embarrassing, I know) and I couldn’t stop. He kept saying “stop crying stop crying” and then he said “I know why you’re crying, it’s because you’re 25 and you don’t know how to drive”.  I laugh about it now, but it fucking sucked at the time!!!  Anyway, three years on and I’m a pro! You’ve got a lot of driving adventures and freedom ahead of you, enjoy!!  [end]
[start] Congratulations! I’m 20 and I’ve had a huge fear of driving but I’ve been working to get over it and I passed my test yesterday. It’s more common than you think and I’m so proud of you!!  [end]
[start] I’m 25 I have a driving license. I don’t know how to drive a car. I got the license through 3rd world magic. [end]
[start] Username checks out.  [end]
[start] Great work, I got mine at 35, love drive on my own  [end]
[start] Congrats! I’m almost 20 and still don’t have my drivers license because my parents wouldn’t let me do driving school but I’m on the path to getting it. Driving gives me anxiety too, you’re not alone! [end]
[start] Hey congrats! I totally feel you and am trying to not let the comments get to me. I just want to focus on my driving and get that stupid test done. Your determination inspired me and made me feel like I wasn't alone in this so thank you [end]
[start] Well done, I'm proud of you. [end]
[start] Way to go, friend. I turn 24 at the end of this month, and I just got my license in August.  Didn't get my license when I was 16 because A) my family couldn't afford the $500 for Driver's Ed, and B) I was too stoned to motivate myself to get to it. Then when I was 18, I joined the Navy and spent the next few years bouncing around. It never became a problem until I got to Maryland, which is just too spaced out to get around without a car.  Eventually, I bit the bullet and flew home to Wisconsin to get my license. I was tired of having to ask people for rides all the time.  It's so liberating. My god. Hell, my depression has even improved since I started. I get exactly where you're coming from. [end]
[start] Um okay I will bite, im thirty-eight but in fifteen days I'll be thirty nine years old,never tried to get a learners license at all. [end]
[start] Oh my god I feel this. Everyone in my grade was getting their license when they were 16 or 17 and I took lessons but I had a lot of trouble starting out at first and I didn't do very well with the intrsuctor. Obviously that made me really nervous about it so I did not practice much and then I didn't get my license until after I graduated. I remember not wanting to tell anyone I did not have it and being really embarassed that my grandma had to pick me up from school during my senior year. [end]
[start] I failed my first test. I had driven countless times before in the road, making no mistakes ever. Fucking hit the curb, never did that once before the test, I was so embarrassed. [end]
[start] Oh shit are you me from the future?? 100% this except I'm 19......I already cancelled driving classes for the 4th time this year [end]
[start] Congrats, I'm almost 25 but still kinda scared to take driving lessons. It's in my plan for 2019 [end]
[start] wow I'm 18 and just have a permit, and I already see myself falling into what you went through.  [end]
[start] 29 and only just got mine this year. Laziness and anxiety. Feels good to knock it on the head. [end]
[start] I can feel you my man, I'm 19 in my sophomore year at college and I get shit on so much for it by everyone it affects my life in so many ways.  And it's not like I didn't try to get it either I tested and failed four times and haven't gotten the chance to take it again for a while.  Now I need to renew my permit, so yes I can kind of understand what you went through.  Good on you my man! [end]
[start] GREAT! Congrats man! Driving helps me clear my head  and calms the nerves so I hope you get the same benefits from it lol! Welcome to the family 😌  [end]
[start] Me too! I'm 26 now but I didn't get my license until right when I turned 25 (I always had severe driving anxiety). I'm very happy for you! It feels good, doesn't it?  [end]
[start] Congratulations! I got my driver’s license when I was 25. I didn’t really start driving til I was 30. [end]
[start] Can I ask an honest question? I've just come back from an evening with someone who has awful anxiety. Probably the worst anxiety of anyone I've ever met, and as someone who used to be a professional therapist that's saying something...  You said:  >My instructor was nice, but she also made me feel like shit for not driving  I'm not doubting this is how you felt, but do you feel she was being mean to you because you couldn't drive? It's her job to teach people. If people didn't need lessons, she would be unemployable. My friend confided in me that often she felt excluded  in conversation around our teacher friends. I reminded her that this was not personal, it wasn't anything she'd done, it wasn't malicious etc. She felt excluded cos she couldn't contribute to certain topics, and her anxiety reframed that as 'they don't like me and are excluding me' rather than 'welp this isn't a topic I know much about, I'll sit and listen'.  I'm not minimalising your experience or anxiety. I just picked up on that sentence and wondered if your anxiety was possibly more intrusive than you thought. I know it's not easy, but often most things perceived as a personal attack are just others being thoughtless or insensitive. I know it's not an excuse, but at least it's not intentional.  [end]
[start] Congrats!!! The freedom you have now is beyond imaginable! You can go almost *anywhere* I drove across the US a few years ago, east coast to west coast, it was one of the best things I’ve ever done.   Be smart, don’t drive tired and if you get anxious, pull over.   I wish lots of adventure in your future.   [end]
[start] Grats, this gives me hope that I might go back to learning to drive. Last time I did it, I crashed the car into a stop sign... [end]
[start] Hey that's awesome! I got my license late and it was really only because of my boyfriend that I learned and passed, I had major driving induced anxiety. Oh and I always hated those people who mocked me...In retrospect they seem even more like small minded asshats than they did back then! [end]
[start] I was in the same boat so I still feel like this. (20f) I just completed my driving courses and still need to take my final. I just think about driving on my own and it's a "freeing" feeling; but getting down to it, everytime I step in a car, the overwhelming feeling of failure creeps up my back and I feel like I'm gonna end up getting lost or hurting someone and I get really anxious. My teacher is actually the only person I feel comfortable driving with because he's really nice and doesn't raise his voice or "back seat drive" like other people. I guess that ended up kind of hurting me in the long run... but hopefully I'll get over this so I can finally start my life. [end]
[start] Congrats, man!! I didn’t start driving until my 20’s for the same reasons. It just takes time. You should be proud.  [end]
[start] Yay, good for you OP!!! I didn't get my license until I was 23 because I was scared too. I'm still anxious to drive, and I don't have a car I can even practice on. I live in NYC so having a car isn't really practical, but I hope when I move out of NY (hopefully soon, I hate it here) I won't be too anxious to drive.  [end]
[start] Ahem... NEEEEERRRRRRRD!!!!! nah seriously though, cool brans man.  [end]
[start] Congrats!! I’m almost 23 and still don’t have mine, back home after college and working on it, your post definitely has given me more motivation. My nerves are still there but not as bad as when I was younger. I feel guilty that I can’t drive because it inconveniences others (and myself!) but also feel guilty taking up parents time for me to practice. Definitely been feeling more anxious and depressed at this stage in life and I know once I get this accomplished it will help me feel better. So proud of you, thanks for sharing!  [end]
[start] Awesome! I never even thought of lessons when I got my first car at 23. Prior I had only driven a little bit with my pops and just took the bus everywhere. [end]
[start] Nice job. I started doing my drivers license after school at 18 but had a shit instructer who stressed me out so much that I was physically exhausted.  So i just quit all of that.  I am studying now and don't need a license, so I am probably going to try it again after graduating. [end]
[start] I was in a similar situation. I didnt get my license until I was 24.  I was homeless when I graduated high school. When I asked the army recruiter if I could get my license while in my job-learning phase, they said "yes, you can get your license in AIT". So I joined the Army thinking I would soon get my license. But instead they told me there was no time in AIT, and that I would have to get it at my first duty station.   Well... My first duty station was in Korea. And I couldnt get one there. The funny aspect was that I was a Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic. So I learned how to drive in the military, on big HEMTTS and LMTVS. That still makes me laugh.   In the end I didnt get my license until four years after joining. When I went back stateside for my second duty station I ended up working in the motorpool a quarter of a mile a way (walking distance). So instead of wasting my money on a car, and insurance, and gas, etc, I ended up saving a lot more, and just got rides with people whenever I needed or wanted something. Only problem was when the dining facility closed and I had to find a way across base to grocery shop or go to another dining facility that was open. In the army, also, almost everyone gets a basic military driving license, but it is only good for driving around on base. You have to have a civilian license to drive off base.  After so long, my sergeants pressured me to get my license, because I would always have to catch rides whenever we had to be somewhere across base, and I guess they were worried that I was being lazy. When I would go home on leave I used the charter bus. And during leave I had no car, so leave always sucked.   So they sent me to a wrecker course in Virginia, for towing and recovery. Without ever having a license. Their way of motivating me, plus they needed a tow trucker operator. I had to get a ride there from a sergeant. And then another sergeant in the class had to give me rides every day for three weeks. By this time I was tired of needing to be ferried.   I was about to get married (unrelated, but my fucking god, fellas, beware who you marry) and felt worthless without a car or license. So I asked a guy at work and he ended up letting me drive his Cadillac to get the license. I was told to go in uniform and it would get me to the front and out of the DMV quick. Which, honestly, I think it did, as we only drove in a circle around the DMV, and I only did a few things like parallel park among easier things. But I got the license and felt amazing. Next step was getting a car. Ended up getting an old cop car from someone in the company, because I never trusted dealerships around base because they have a reputation for screwing service members. Got a loan from USAA instead.   6 months later I got out, and was refreshing when I drove away from base, finally able to go home. I won't downplay it, I teared up a little, with the biggest smile on my face. No one is happier than a person that is finally free from the military. You get happier the further you get from base.   TLDR: Learned how to drive using military vehicles for four years WITHOUT a license.  [end]
[start] I rode a bike at the age of 24. It was my bike from my first year in job. Parents never had any money to buy me one, always rode on my friend's scooter sitting behind him. It was always a joke in the friend circle that I didn't know how to ride and always rode behind someone. Bought my first bike, learnt riding on it. I have made a lot bike trips now as long as 700 kms in 2 days. Feels independent, powerful and liberating.  [end]
[start] Congrats! I was 29 when I got my license. Sometimes it takes longer to do a thing and there's nothing wrong with that. [end]
[start] I’m 18 and don’t have my license. I got a learners permit when I was 16, not because I wanted it but because all my friends were getting theirs. I drove around with my dad in the carpark a bit and didn’t feel comfortable and had my first driving lesson a few weeks later and felt even less comfortable.   I’ve been really wanting to get it for a while now but am so anxious about driving a car. I have no problem being a passenger, even when being driven by a bad driver but I can’t stand being in control of it.  I know the only way to get over it is through exposure and this post has inspired me to follow through with getting my license. [end]
[start] I'm 34, a doctor and I don't know how to drive. I feel that most "normal people skills" have always eluded me. I don't think I can do it, because I have trouble telling left from right and I'm over anxious. Kudos to you!! [end]
[start] Brother in law has no interest in even learning. He’s 25 and has no shame or ambition  [end]
[start] I got my license at 35 5 years ago. Good for you if you live in a big city not sure what the big deal is with getting it in your 20s [end]
[start] I got my full licence at 36. Not for any particular reason except I had no access to my own car until I was in my 30s. You’re doing fine. The more you drive the better you get and the less anxious you feel.  [end]
[start] Congratulations!  Im 28 and currently waiting for my practical test date.  I used to walk 15 minutes to work, 45 minutes to the gym and thought “ why spend a fortune on a car just to be lazy”  12 years later, the love of my life is pregnant. She turned to me and said “ im not fucking driving myself to the maternity ward if theres an emergency”  At that moment It just clicked, to be a better partner and father I had to get it done. No excuses about the cost. So i said fine il start this weekend.  Im just lucky to have a woman that supports me and pushes me when I need it. [end]
[start] Holy shit are you me? Your teenage experience with driving sounds exactly like mine. I didn't want to say this to anyone out loud since I should be responsible for my growth but having a driving that was plain unfriendly and stressed me out has seriously made me fear driving and completely made me disinterested whereas I've noticed my friends that like driving also had very positive experiences with their instructor. I'm glad there's someone who at least had the same experience as me and managed to overcome it [end]
[start] > By age 19, people start to laugh at me for not having the next step in my license  Christ, I'm 46 and I've only ever been behind the wheel of a car once. I had a provisional license for 10 years but I never managed to get a single lesson. [end]
[start] Lessons??? I learned to drive a car just by riding in one all my life? I don’t fucking get it? [end]
[start] This was hard to read as someone who can't convince their SO to conjure up the confidence to go get her beginners. We have constant fights about her being stuck at the house bored, or needed to be picked up places.   Big thorn in my side since I've been driving since 16 and it feels like such a simple task.  [end]
[start] why do millennials need a trophy and attention for every basic function they perform? [end]
[start] Yay! I also got my license this year at 25! I got my learner's at 16 but I had had "overprotective" parents who would never let me practice so it took me this long. I also have my own car now. It's awesome.  Congratulations! [end]
[start] Its good you did it for yourself and the jokes will stop.  That said, don't feel like you need to get on the road. There's more than enough bad drivers. We don't need anymore. Just be happy you can do it. But don't do it. [end]
[start] I'm 24 and I dont have my license and probs never will. I hate cars and everything about them. Ive always felt personally cars are too expensive, too dangerous, boring, and more of a status symbol than actually being useful most of the time. I know cars are useful and needed in a lot of cases so I dont harsh on people for liking them or driving all the time but to me cars are super fucking boring and humongous wastes of money in most cases. I'm mainly taking about sports or luxury cars, like cars that have no practical purpose beyond looking cool. I rather get shot in the back of the head than own a fancy overpriced to hell dangerous ass car. I hate car culture and as a result just bum rides off people, use uber, and or public transport to get around. So dont worry about the people who were giving you shit you got people like me that hate cars and laugh at people when they think its bizzare I dont drive. I  have literally never even felt the smallest urge to drive let alone get a car.  [end]
[start] Congrats!!!     I was kind of in the same boat as you, and I know how hard it was for me to get over the anxiety and just get up and go for it some days. So many times I just wanted to cancel the day's lessons and just give up. Ah those were some rough times, but at the ripe old age of 29 I finally got my license.   And let me tell you, it felt amazing to have overcome all that and get out there on the road after all this time.     Super proud of you OP, well done. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Congrats!  [end]
[start] Congratulations! Enjoy. [end]
[start] Thats so great!! You are facing your fears! Keep at it and driving will become second nature to you [end]
[start] I can totally relate...I’ve been embarrassed about my lack of driving for a long time. I’m lucky to live in a metropolitan area so lots of options for me but, I wish I had that freedom. Very happy for you and am so glad you found the strength to persevere. [end]
[start] Ah that's real good for you! I'm 22 and I don't have mine either. Just wasn't interested and didn't have any place to be since I'm out of school and a job. Mindset is very in on Korea and hoping to get out there someday. You can really just get around anywhere without a car...  I've probably driven about 3 or 4 hours total and man. It really just gets me shaking. When I start thinking about driving, I immediately get nightmares about it. Either my passenger dying because I was driving or I hit someone and kill them.   Driving culture is very. Eh.. When I was 20, that's when it was the "Oh, you still don't drive?" questions popped up. And boy howdy.  [end]
[start] Saving this whole thread since I need to start practicing driving soon 😣 [end]
[start] I just did my first driving lesson today if that makes anyone feel better (24)... [end]
[start] Congratulations!   Don't feel bad, there are literally tens of thousands of people over 30 living in cities all over the country that can't drive even a little [end]
[start] Congratulations!!!! I know driving can be hard. I'm sorry you hate shit teachers who made you feel like crap :( [end]
[start] Don't worry. I got my license when I was 35.  And I also enjoy driving a lot. I didn't know what I was missing. [end]
[start] Omg are you me!? [end]
[start] Congrats! That's literally an awesome moment. My husband still doesnt have his license and it has been a struggle but we are working on it. He just has so much anxiety when driving.  [end]
[start] Omg I can relate! I haven’t driven alone yet. This is helpful to me.  [end]
[start] Hey, don't let this worry you, I did not get my license to drive until I was 30.  You did good, you overcame a fear and should be proud. [end]
[start] I'm 24 and will be getting my license next year!! I'm so excited for you and good on you!! :D [end]
[start] Straight savage  [end]
[start] Nice job!! I have a similar story, you’re not alone! Good for you for going for it.  [end]
[start] I got mine when I was sixteen, my best friend who is in his late 30’s (as am I) still doesn’t have a license. It’s weird, some people just have no desire to drive so I respect your decision to wait!   Congratulations on getting yours and doing the thing!  [end]
[start] Seriously in no time you’ll forget all about this as if nothing happened, and you’ll have become an excellent driver! [end]
[start] Congrats everyone! Just curious where you all live. It's impossible to not drive in most areas mid West United States so I had to learn. I am terrified of driving in major cities, so I could see how so many of you got it after 18 [end]
[start] You’ll learn a lot of things they dont teach you in driving school nor at the dmv [end]
[start] congrats bro. I started learning at 16, got my license at 18, never officially drove until 25. the times in between were fraught with anxiety and now I'm having trouble doing it again (moved away for job to a place I never needed to drive, now I'm back and kinda need to but it scares the crap out of me). stupid anxiety, one of these days I'm driving with and leaving you in some undisclosed location.  oh, one time during during school, my instructor made me drive to trader Joe's where he left me idling in the car for 20+minutes while he went grocery shopping. [end]
[start] I only got my license at 23 (failed the written test in high school and didn't bother to take it again for years) so I know how it feels. Eventually had a friend teach me and got my license and I feel so great.  [end]
[start] Good for you!!!! Well done!!! I’m 22 and still haven’t drove alone, I hope I will soon too!!!!! [end]
[start] Congratulations! I can really vividly remember the first time I ever drove by myself, and how different it felt being alone in the car - I think it’s a really incredible feeling and I hope you get to cherish it ! I also hope your experiences driving continue to be fun and freeing ! You deserve it :)  [end]
[start] Congrats! It feels good to have that independence. I got my license last year a month after I turned 28. [end]
[start] Congrats I’m 19 and haven’t even gotten a permit yet because I’m anxious as hell, it’s not so much a lack of confidence in myself, that’s a small thing I can get over, it’s just I know there’s a lot of shitty drivers in the world and it only takes one to mess up your day and that thought just kinda keeps me away from wanting to drive  [end]
[start] I only got my license in January of this year. My story is a bit different to yours in that I've wanted to drive my whole life. Whenever I watched shows like Top Gear, I would imagine that I'm driving the car.  I'm from South Africa, so the ages at which you may take the test are a bit different. 17 y/o for your learners license and 18 y/o for you drivers license.  In South Africa getting a license is an expensive endeavor and I didn't grow up in the wealthiest household. I got my first full time job in retail once I left school. Before I started working, I thought to myself finally, I'll have money and would sign up for driving lessons. Things did not go so smoothly. Turns out that a retail employee barely earns enough to do anything other than barely surviving.   After 2 years in retail, I finally left and persued my passion as a programmer. I have no formal training which made it a bit difficult but eventually I found a place that didn't want any certification of training, instead they only had an interview and a couple of test.  I aced the test and today I'm working as an entry level web developer earning 5 times more than what I made as a retail worker with regular overtime.  Back to topic, I made more money and after years I could finally afford to get driving lessons. Today I'm 22 y/o.  [end]
[start] I didn't get my license til I was 23, I had failed my driving test a few times and just got tired of trying and eventually just said "fuck it." Then after a while I started driving with my Dad and after having to rely on family getting me to and from work I realized it was time to just get it done with. Tested and passed and now just driving around is one of my favorite things [end]
[start] I’m 30 and I recently got my license about a month ago. I grew up in NYC & Boston and there’s absolutely no reason for me to have a car due to public transportation and have a lot of accessibility around me. I put off the whole driving ordeal until I moved out to California. As soon as I passed my test, I bought my first car about a week later. I’m happy to be able to drive around without asking anybody for a ride. I recently started going on the freeway. At first I was terrified but once or twice merging in and out I got comfortable and enjoy the freeway more than driving locally.   Enjoy the road! And I’m happy to hear that I’m not the only one who waited later on in life to drive.  [end]
[start] Congrats!  [end]
[start] I didn’t drive til I was 25 either. Passed my test on the first try. Now it’s old hat and I drive everywhere. The furthest I’ve gone is 800 miles.  [end]
[start] What's so hard, it's an automatic anyway  _rage incoming_ [end]
[start] Good job. Seriously.   -   I'm 26, almost 27 now and for one reason or another (anxiety, depression, etc) haven't gotten my license yet.   I completed drivers school when I was 16 or 17. Didn't really have any bad experiences like you did.   I only recently realized that I might have depression, but I've had anxiety problems for as long as I can remember.   I'm at the point in my life where I think I might need medication. Unfortunately, it's not exactly easy going to a therapist or a doctor when you have an anxiety problem.   It's devolved to the point where I'm using the excuse that I haven't gotten help yet to delay doing things like getting my license.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, posts like this make me think that I should probably just bite the bullet and get these things over with. And not only that I should, but that I probably can. [end]
[start] Congratulations, I can relate!   I got my licence in my teens but never drove. I really had no confidence. It wasn’t till a friend let me use her old Toyota and have me a few more lessons that I developed a bit of courage in my mid 20s. I discovered I have zero fear of driving, am quite competent, and have driven loads of different cars, both in Australia and in Europe. It’s really never too late!   The only downside: despite the convenience and freedom you have with your own car, buying and maintaining it (especially if you don’t need it for work) is an expensive luxury. You’d really be better off with a mix of car share/rent/Uber/taxis than capital cost, insurance, registration and maintenance.  [end]
[start] I am so so proud of you! This is something that I'm struggling with right now too. I failed it twice and I am saving up for professional lessons. My family never actually bothered teaching me in a helpful way. I would always get yelled at when I was behind the wheel, which only increased my anxiety and made me more prone to making mistakes. I got my learner's permit like 5 years ago and even bought a car which I used to drive around all the time. Failed the test twice, then I lost my car in an accident and am now dealing with worsening anxiety. I feel like I'm behind everyone else in life not having achieved this basic skill but I'm not going to give up. Your story has inspired me and strengthened my resolve to keep moving forward!!  [end]
[start] My step sons mom never got her driver's license and shes well in her 30s. Im sorry you felt so uncomfortable about learning. I understand though. I think we all get anxious over things that would be normal to others.  [end]
[start] Congratulations! Same here, anxiety about driving set me back. Thank goodness for a very patient husband who could teach me. I finally drove last year for the first time at age 26 :)  [end]
[start] Congrats ! I have driving anxiety so I avoid driving as much as possible. I’m 21 and I had my license since 18 so I was a little different. I’m happy for you and keep pushing !  [end]
[start] Congrats! It's strange, because I'm a college student with no license, but here, it's considered totally normal for people my age to not even have an L or N. [end]
[start] I didn't get my license til 25 for similar reasons. And when I finally went for the road tests with my parents, that's freak me out and by the time the proctor got in the car I was having a panic attack and would immediately fuck something up and fail. I ended up going with my girlfriend and aced it cuz she just got me hype instead of warning me about every little thing. Congrats!!! [end]
[start] Regardless of age, that feeling of freedom is amazing. Good on you for getting there.  [end]
[start] Congrats! That’s a big step and it takes guts to face fears. Taking my drivers test in January, I’m nervous but feeling positive!  [end]
[start] Congratulations!  It will only get easier and more comfortable the more you drive [end]
[start] It took me until 27 to get my license, took the permit test 3 times until I passed, and didn't pass my driving test until the 3rd time too. Always thought I wouldn't be able to drive, but now it's not so bad, fun sometimes I'd say! Still nervous during big intersections though..  So good job! [end]
[start] You have a post saying you are 23 years old which you posted 10 months ago. Imagine being the person who gilded this. Lmao. [end]
[start] I got my license when I was 18. I am still nervous every time I drive and try to avoid it even though I enjoy it while I'm doing it. I'm glad I'm not alone in my drivers anxiety.  [end]
[start] Passed at 26, before i was happy to walk everywhere. It just feels good to have an opportunity open to you that hadn’t previously. Well done mate be proud of yourself! :)  [end]
[start] Congrats! I didn't get my license until 25 and only because my mother and sisters got tired of driving me around. Once you start driving it's hard to imagine how you ever lived life as a pedestrian!  [end]
[start] 25 here and never driven a car myself even though I have a licence, I can't afford a car so I don't have anything to drive regularly. Sometimes people want me to drive and I refuse because I am not confident on the road that much and they make fun of me. All because I can't afford a car.   People can be mean. [end]
[start] I didn’t get my license until I was 30! My anxiety prevented me for so long. Once I had a child, something in me clicked and I just knew I had to get it. I can relate so much to that amazing feeling of your first few solo drives. Now I actually really enjoy driving! Congrats on overcoming your anxiety!  [end]
[start] Geez, I can relate. I got my license just after college started (but it took me 4 tries to pass), but even now I don’t drive on my own unless it’s a really short distance. The fact you started means you’ve made great progress.   I can’t not feel anxiety about driving. There’s just so much pressure and the anxiety around hitting/killing someone or severely injuring myself means I avoid driving even if its an inconvenience. [end]
[start] Good job. I had a permit for 2 years before i got my license because i was just to scared to drive. Paralyzing fear of getting hurt or hurting someone held me back till i was 20. I finally got my license but the fear didnt go away. It took me a week to build up the courage to drive on my own. I decided to go around the block for my first time driving alone. But i sat in my car for an hour and then cried when i couldnt bring myself to start the engine. I went inside and took a nap, then got up and tried again. It was terrifying but liberating. I finally drove myself. To this day i still have a lot of fear. But baby steps have moved me to a new place  [end]
[start] My girlfriend actually bribed the examiner 🤦‍♂️ she's driving properly now though. More concerned about the rules than me 😅 [end]
[start] I'm 28, never driven a car. Probably never will. The looks Americans give me lol [end]
[start] So proud of you!!! [end]
[start] Proud of you buddy  [end]
[start] Congrats! I'm 22 and still don't have my license. But I'm succeeding at work and make enough money to buy a car, I dont necessarily want to buy one because it's a lot of money to maintain and what not. But I'm in the same boat of not being interested in driving. The courses I would've had to have taken in high school were expensive (about $800USD), and I just don't have many places I want/need to go. Everyone around me is pushing me for it. I want to be independent but I also don't feel as if driving is truly that important. [end]
[start] Next step become a car enthusiast [end]
[start] I’m almost 23 and have yet to get my license. I feel the exact same anxiety that you had. Good job getting out of that!  [end]
[start] When my aunt was 12 she saw a bad accident involving teenage girls in front of her house. Their grandpa (my great grandpa) ran outside and tried to save them, got really burned, and wasn’t able to save them. It bothered her for years after that.  She ended up not getting her license because of it. She eventually got her license once she got pregnant because she wanted to be able to take her daughter around, but that wasn’t until she was almost 30.  [end]
[start] Congratulations! I hope you enjoy your new found freedom! I think it was better for you to wait and do it on your own time instead of being forced into it!  [end]
[start] Good for you, glad you're having fun! I love to drive, except on the freeway. How did you get to work/school before driving? [end]
[start] I'm 21 and in the same boat as you. My oldest brother just have me his older car though so I've been looking into getting my liscence for Christmas! Congrates tho! I hope all the stress and anxiety that came with it is worth it cause it deadly does eat at me.  [end]
[start] Are you me? I didn't get my license until I was 26 [end]
[start] I took my test at 16, felt great. Failed the written test.  Came back in two weeks, passed the written test and then failed the driving test. I drove through a stop sign and then parked AT THE DMV about 3 inches from the next parked car. Came back the 3rd time, not so bewildered, and passed. I now travel across the country for work in new places every 3 months or so. No driving accident in about 14 years. Dont let it get you down is all I'm saying, and I'm happy for you. [end]
[start] I'm 26, no license yet. Thinking of getting it before summer though.  [end]
[start] I passed my test at 29. Started having lessons at 21. Forgot about it for many years and just recently passed.  [end]
[start] Driving sucks. Honestly from someone who drives a lot, congrats. Welcome to the club [end]
[start] where do you live...? i didn’t get my license until i was 23. Never really needed it before then. It rarely ever came up in conversation and if it did nobody ever tried to bully me over it.  Is driving a really big deal in your culture or something? [end]
[start] You beat me by 3 years, good job dude. I just started driving this year and I am 28. I still don't go on anything other than side streets but once I did a 1/2 mile on a 3 lane expressway before getting scared/anxious so maybe soon I will be able to drive to Walmart or something. [end]
[start] I've been driving since i was 16 or 17 but didn't get my license til the age of 25 and even failed the test twice (damn paralell parking)...there's no shame in learning at your own pace [end]
[start] I'm 23 now and I have not my license yet. Well, I always had fear of driving and no interest in the car world itself.Like you, my friends completely joked on me and this always made me uncomfortable (mostly when I'm in front of some girls). Then, It gave me depression and anxiety for all past years and, added to all other personal things, it's been a very hard time.  I wish I could overcome this fact and getting my license finally. However congrats mate for achieving it and good luck for your next drives ;) [end]
[start] I’m 29 and got my licence about a month ago. On the Saturday that just passed, I managed to overcome my fear and drive into the city to have my car receive its routine service with Toyota. I was initially going to have someone with me but when they bailed, I freaked out. Then I told myself “No. I can do this.”  And I did! [end]
[start] Makes me teary :) [end]
[start] I know the feeling. Growing up, I didn't get my license at first because my dad's license was revoked due to multiple DUIs and my mom never had hers. My brother was gracious to give me some lessons but he had his own life and I wasn't interested. I went to college without it and didn't need it much there. I had family offer to teach me but I made my mistakes and never followed through. Now, I'm 23 and don't have my license. My girlfriend has hers and I do my best not to rely on her for it but she also told me that she wouldn't let me drive her car even if I got my license. My family kinda teases me about it and it just pushes me further and further away from the idea. [end]
[start] Congratulations! I’m 23 and finally got my license last month. I grew up in an urban area and never had the desire to drive but I started grad school in a totally rural part of my state, which apparently has never heard of sidewalks. It was difficult not being able to get to the grocery store, classes, or work without the help of someone. Whenever my group of friends did something I awkwardly had to ask for a ride. I can completely relate to the feeling of embarrassment whenever the topic of driving came up. I avoided it as much as possible. When I started to learn to drive I had more anxiety then I anticipated. Failed my test a few times purely due to nerves. But finally passing with the help of my friends, family, and boyfriend was an amazing feeling. And now I can drive! It’s so freeing. Proud of us!  [end]
[start] Similar story here. I got my license at 16 but within my first year of driving (never alone cause it was a learners permit) I crashed the car while driving with my parents (drove into a ditch, long story but it wasn't fully my fault but) which pretty much scared me out of wanting to drive for a long time. I moved away for university a couple years later and rarely had access to a car.  4.5y into my license, I had to do my test for the next step otherwise I'd lose my license and have to start from scratch. I practiced while visiting my parents during the holidays and did my test. Turns out there's a loophole where if you pass, since you need to wait a year before doing the final test, they must renew your license so you'd have enough time.  Since I was still away from home, I rarely got to practice so it was never a priority to do my final test. Recently, my parents moved to be closer, so I more frequently get the chance to drive. Also, I'm 25 now, so there's no longer a price penalty when renting cars. In August, I rented a car to go on a solo road trip for the first time (6h drive to my home town). It felt great. It was a huge milestone for me and made me feel much more free.  Finally, in a couple weeks I'll do my final test. My license expires in less than a year, so I need to do it ASAP. If I don't, then I'd have to start again from zero. [end]
[start] i'm 32 and have never driven a car in my life, every time i look at getting lessons i just cant bring myself to pay that much money. I really should learn. [end]
[start] As a 19 y.o. who has only ever gotten my permit this makes me so happy to read. Honestly after getting in a car accident when I was younger I have been terrified of driving. I get a lot of anxiety and always feel other drivers are judging me.   I've been determined to get my license before my twentith birthday so I have been looking into classes but it's still nerve racking.   And it was that same for me as far as my friends go. Often times I just lie and say I have my license but can't afford a car atm. Though luckily two of my friends are in the same position (of not having their drivers licenses) so that does give me some solice [end]
[start] Congratulations! My best man did not get his license until he was 24. When we were younger, he had a permit and flipped the car his first time touching the gas. He was pulling out of a driveway, and too much pressure and rolled down a 50 foot hill. Anyway, it scared him. We did not really do a lot of Go Karting as kids together and after the accident he told me he never liked driving and I never really realized but he also did not ride a bike. I decided we needed to go go karting and I taught him to ride a bike. We went to different colleges, he built some road hours and road a bike around his town during college to get to classes and stuff. Then he got a license afterwards. He lives in Korea now and I miss the heck out of him. [end]
[start] I love in a fairly metropolitan area with... I don't wanna say good public transportation, but certainly a lot of it. Regardless, I've taught a number of people to drive that were 20 or older, because they never needed to learn so they didn't. Which is also just to say 25 doesn't seem so late to me, and you're certainly in good company. [end]
[start] Congrats, feels good to drive a car.  [end]
[start] Im 19 and in this position. I finally started working on my license last summer but then I was in a freak accident and it ruined my confidence and sense of security as a driver. I struggled with driving anxiety before and now its back, tenfold. Even as a passenger now I have intrusive thoughts about horrible wrecks the whole time Im in the car. Its awful and Im too afraid to go back to the driving lessons, its all a bunch of 15 year olds who don’t give a fuck and Im there, the adult, quaking in my boots. I need to be able to drive myself for school and work but Im just so scared :( [end]
[start] Something happened. There was some monumental shift that took place that just changed everything. All these comments just do not compute.  [end]
[start] I'm 22 and just got my license a few weeks! I was terrified at first but my girlfriend was very helpful and supportive. It's a nice feeling not relying on others for a ride anymore. Congrats dude! [end]
[start] I got my license at 24 and bought a car a month later. My immediate family wasn't rich and so I had no one I could ask to borrow a car and learn from. I got a good job and paid for lessons. My instructor wasn't terrible but I could do a better job of teaching. I've been driving for years now but I will say the first year was traumatizing but so necessary. Finding parking, parallel parking, knowing the dimensions of your car, internalizing street rules, learning how to read signs etc. were all things that tortured me. I once cried in my car because I spent an hour and a half looking for parking and couldn't find any.  You can't learn these things from a book or video, the only way to learn how to drive is to drive. After a few months it becomes second nature and you don't even think about it you just do it. HUGE TIP: new drivers buy a car with a rear view cam and parking sensors it'll save you a LOT of headaches! [end]
[start] Was driving on daddy's lap in the parking lot at age 6. Some people I guess [end]
[start] I just turned 21 and I still can't drive. It's very embarrassing when anyone even mentions driving because I know I cant. My little bro (18) just got his license before me and it made me feel even worse. I've so far failed my drivers test twice.   I do have some chances to practice but I dont take them because I'm anxious and people who drive where I am probably dont have licenses themselves. Constant accidents. Not being able to drive still haunts my dreams (literally) and hangs over me like a cloud 24/7.   I'm very proud of you for getting it done! I'm glad that you waited until you were ready, no matter what anyone says, you did what was best for you!!  [end]
[start] I'm 21, I failed my license test twice and my permit test once, I did eventually get my license at 18 but like i'm still a hesitant driver. I still bail on plans if the only way to get there is by driving on the highway, and I used to get panic attacks every time I had fill up at a gas station, note that I live in New Jersey and literally all I have to do is open my window and remember to park on the right side... you are not alone my dude!!! proud of you!!!!!!! life isn't a race, there are no time limits on achieving your goals (unless you're like.. chronically dying or something... in which case uhh sorry)  [end]
[start] Never driven a car, 33 now, probably never will because of poor sight. Can't laser them because if eye disease.  I'm just stuck..  [end]
[start] Thank you I’m 22 and still don’t drive hopefully I will learn soon. I am ready for that independence. [end]
[start] I was really nervous when I got my license too! I’ve had it for over a year now and I still have places I’m not comfortable driving, but I feel stronger on the road every day!  [end]
[start] This gives me hope! I’m 23 and I haven’t gotten my license yet. I get so paranoid and nervous. My boyfriend took me driving once in a city and I bawled the whole time. Ended up pulling over and making him drive cause I was so scared. I’m sure once I actually tried and quit avoiding driving school I can get it. And hey, maybe it’ll be fun too. Thanks for this post. I really needed it. [end]
[start] Good on you! I’m 26 and just beginning classes/lessons to get my license. Better late than never! [end]
[start] What a liberating feeling; I’ve been driving my entire ‘adult’ life, and had jobs that had me driving 1,000 miles a week. Don’t get complacent!  And learn to drive a Manual if you can! The ability to drive any car your might come across in your life is a very liberating thing too!  [end]
[start] Man people like that are just full of shit. I never understood this, my parents do it a lot. Fr, people out there busting their asses for their small personal victories. To you it might not be big, for what they have and what they can do, it's a big deal. What does it hurt you to encourage them to get better? It costs nothing. Imagine being a dick to someone trying to improve themselves just because they're not already as good as you. People can shove their judgement up their asses.  Whatever man. Keep your head up OP, and keep at it. You're doing this for yourself and every small victory counts. I read this on some other sub a while back and it has stuck with me: you don't have to be better than anyone else, you just have to be better than the you from yesterday.  Coincidentally, I have my road test tomorrow so wish me luck haha [end]
[start] Good job! [end]
[start] Its funny how the smallest negative life experiences can end up fucking with someone for so long. [end]
[start] I got my license at 25 too! Never too late! [end]
[start] Yay!!! Good for you!   Like you, I wasn’t super interested in getting my license at 16. When I was 17, I was a passenger in an accident and it was pretty traumatic. I didn’t even want to get in a car for a while.   I decided to go to school in NYC and felt like, at least there, I could hide the fact that I couldn’t drive. After a few years, I even told people that my license had simply expired because I didn’t really need one. Smart, city people don’t bother with cars anyway.   At 24 I left NYC for Cleveland, OH. The guy I’d been dating lived there and he was such a jerk that only six months after moving over there, I was making plans to leave. I wanted to buy an old pickup, pack it up and head West. But I needed a license. I asked my jerk bf to help me learn. He literally screamed at me the entire time and I was too freaked out to learn. I failed my driving test and bought a plane ticket to CO.   I lived in Denver for another decade or so before finally getting the courage up to try again. I rode a bike everywhere and feigned environmental superiority as my reason. I *love* riding my bike but it’s not ideal in -5* and I just couldn’t admit that I was scared of driving. I was also very very poor and nowhere close to being able to afford a car so it really didn’t seem like it was worth even trying.   Once a bf asked me to move his car for him, like one parking space forward. Get in, roll forward ten feet, stop, get out. My heart was POUNDING.   I was 30 years old by the time I decided to face my fear. 30. I failed my driving test again. 30. What a loser. I took it again and passed. Still. 30 years old and celebrating accomplishing something people half my age did all day long.   Now I live in CA and driving is absolutely required. Nothing out here is designed with pedestrians or cyclists or mass transit in mind. Thankfully, I’m a very comfortable and competent driver now, nearly a decade after getting my license.   It really held me back and I let it. Now I love being able to just hop in my car whenever and go on adventures!  [end]
[start] Proud of you! I think this might be more common than you think. It feels so good having the freedom to go where you want whenever you want. Independence is awesome. [end]
[start] Congratulations but I don't see it as a particularly unusual story. A friend of mine told me today that she only passed her test 4 years ago. She's 58. Passing your test isn't the end of the story though. Get some miles under your wheels, never stop observing and analyzing the traffic and road conditions and learn to anticipate what that other idiot is going to do. Passing your test is just the start so good luck. [end]
[start] I drove since I was 9, alone since 15 lmao [end]
[start] Wow thank u for sharing this. I am in the exact same spot. One day I’ll drive alone  [end]
[start] Congrats man! Driving is really fun, feeling like you can anywhere you want! [end]

[TITLE] My little brother recently lost his battle with depression. Today is his birthday. If everyone would reach out to someone in his honor; a friend, family member, anyone (whether you think they’re struggling or not) it would bring a small amount of comfort on an otherwise painful day. Do it for Rob. [TITLE]
[start] When I saw this I immediately called my friend to check up on her, she's been struggling. We talked for a half hour and she said it made her day. And now we're actually going out to eat later. Your brother will be in our hearts. May he rest in peace. So sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] I am so sorry. I can't imagine how hard this is for you and your family. Thank you for spreading positivity in the midst of so much pain. [end]
[start] Done!  That is a great way to honor his memory! [end]
[start] I have a friend who killed themselves 4 months ago. I know your pain. I've also reached out to some of my friends who I know are suffering just to make sure they're okay [end]
[start] Today is for Rob. [end]
[start] Just checked up on a loved one. Thank you for this reminder. [end]
[start] The one person I could always go to is no longer my friend. I found out the other day that she was messing around with my ex while he was living with me. We were together 4 years. She was my best friend since I was 3. I’m so thankful for the other people that were there for me when I found out. I will reach out to someone I haven’t talked to in a while, in honor of rob and everyone else who has lost their battle.  [end]
[start] Big hugs to you. I remember reading your post last month. Not sure what someone would do in these situations so it's hard to give advice, just wishing you the strength to get through this. [end]
[start] I've been in a dark place with depression but was lucky to have friends surrounding and supporting me.  I can't stress enough how important the message behind this post is, just one little chat with someone can snap you out of your usual routines and thoughts and put you in a better place. Sorry for your loss OP. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry for your loss. I will reach out to two people I know right now. This is a mighty idea and thanks for reminding us all.  [end]
[start] I’m sorry for your loss. And thank you for the inspiration, going to call a friend as soon as I get home. Really, thank you, and thank you, Rob. [end]
[start] I have many mental health issues. My mother and I are very poor. (I'm talking yearly income of <$15,000.) I desperately need therapy in order to keep surviving but I cannot afford one, even ones that will cut their rate in half for me (can't afford even $50/week).   I was on the way to see my psychiatrist today (a huge hit to my wallet every couple of months) when my boyfriend told me he would be willing to pay for my therapy. With all I have put him through, he hasn't given up on me in 4 years. Thank you, Chris. I love you.   Today, and every day, we will keep Rob's memory alive.  [end]
[start] I’m sorry for your pain. I reached into myself because of your post.  [end]
[start] It makes such a difference.  Lately I’ve been going through a lot, and to say that I’m overwhelmed wouldn’t scratch the surface. Most days I feel like I’m drowning.  I was already struggling with severe depression when I received some news that sent both my living and financial situations into sudden crisis.  This is on top of trying to navigate relationship issues, a new job, and college classes that started this week after 7 years outside of a classroom.  I’ve spent most of this week having one emotional breakdown after the next while simultaneously trying to rebuild my life in a way that will ultimately be more positive for my future self, hard as it’s been.  There has been more than one moment where I thought to myself that I should just force quit. Just be done with it. That I am NOT strong enough and that there’s no getting my head above water.  I reached out to my manager and let her know that I would be out for a few days, with a brief rundown of what had happened. The following days were hard, and the suicidal thoughts were at the forefront of my mind. When I returned to work I was nervous that everyone would be in the know in regards to my very personal business, as I work in a team service restaurant and my absence from the floor would be noticed.  However nobody said anything when I returned, save for a few telling smiles that were a few degrees warmer than normal. Until someone did.  I was in the kitchen when my head chef, with whom I have nearly zero relationship, came up to me and said “Hey I heard you were going through some stuff, and I won’t make you talk about it if you don’t want to, but I’m here if you need anything okay?”. He gave me a reassuring back rub/ pat as he walked away, and it was as if the clouds cleared. This person that I don’t even know that well risked a potentially awkward/ unwanted interaction to let me know that I don’t have to deal with this alone, and when I’ve found myself in a dark place these last few days, I keep going back to that moment. Thanks, Chef.  [end]
[start] Made a Doctors appointment for my sister who told me 2 months ago that she's going thru the hardest time of her life. She had been putting it off this whole time.  She cried and thanked me. [end]
[start] My cousin is in the middle of a male to female transition and was recently hospitalized for a fit of bipolar. I haven’t seen her since the day they went to the hospital but she was sent home last week. I’ve been meaning to send a message but haven’t for no good reason. I’ll send it now.  [end]
[start] For Rob yo!!!!! [end]
[start] I'm sorry for your loss and admire your efforts to help others. I'm going to check on some people, thank you.  [end]
[start] Hey there. I’m really sorry for your loss. I know today must be rough. I lost my big brother to suicide in 2004. It gets easier with time, but it always sucks.  [end]
[start] thank you for the reminder  Rob memory will save many💖 cant imagine what yr going through. the black dog is a bastard  [end]
[start] My best friend lost her brother in 2017 to depression. It is his birthday today and his name was Robert. I did reach out to her today of course.  Sorry for your loss as well. I can't imagine the pain and wish I could help my friend better [end]
[start] It's good to remember to check up on people. I haven't been depressed in a while, but I get that way a lot. So often that people just are used to it and no one checks up on me. I'm ok right now, but when I'm depressed, that shit makes me want to overdose. I'm bipolar. 60% of people with bipolar attempt suicide. 15-17% die. If anyone feels like shit today, you can message me. [end]
[start] I was popular in highschool and college, but then I failed out of college with a full scholarship due to mental health issues.  That was in 2014.  I've since gotten my associate's of science, but my mental illness haunts me.  I've been in the hospital 10 times since 2013 and was discharged from my most recent hospitalization a week ago from today.  I've attempted suicide three times and I have scars from this last incident all over my body.  At least one hundred.  I'm **not** posting this to make anyone feel guilty for not understanding or to garner sympathy, I just want anyone reading who might know someone going through something similar that a lot of this can be avoided by speaking up and asking sooner.  A simple "How are you doing lately?" is all you need to start with.  You can gauge from there using facial expressions, body language, voice tone, etc., if they're telling the truth or not.  Most people will.  And doing it casually but sincerely is really one of the best ways to go about it.  It can open up some really productive and helpful conversations.  Hugs to all who've reached out to others because of this and hugs to anyone going through something similar.  I have many medical issues from mental health to physical health, and I'm willing to chat to anyone in need, let it be a support person or someone needing support.  We're all here for each other.  Let's make that fact known.  <3 [end]
[start] All my best to you and your family. Just remember: depression is a cruel beast, and, as someone who has been battling it myself for decades, it’s just as real a beast as anything.  I’m so sorry for your loss.   Remember and cherish the good times. Hold the smiles and laughs close to your heart, for that’s what he would have wanted. They were all he had.  [end]
[start] I reached out for rob per your ask. She hasnt replied but she will. Be strong [end]

[start] Deepest condolences. Rob was loved by you and possibly other family members too. I hate depression. It’s a dark demon. I’ll reach out to my friend in honor of this post and Rob. Hoping he’ll answer because depression makes you retreat into isolation. I’ll update this later!  [end]
[start] So sorry :( I will do exactly that. I lost a close friend a few months back. [end]
[start] The people I feel the most for I have the hardest time being there for them. I just feel there pain and like there's nothing I can do to help them, and I imagine that's exactly how they feel too. Anyone else get that? [end]

[start] Called my friend / frat brother. Spoke for almost two hours on his business (profitable, but barely so low income). Volunteered to do free finance and ops work for him just to cover his short term needs. He told me it was the best thing someone can offer at the moment.  Good friend. Heard he went radio silent on the world and was really surprised he picked up my call. Post marriage, it’s been harder and harder to keep up but I’m really glad I called. We’re gonna do lunch in a few weeks with another close friend of ours.  Thanks for sharing Rob’s story. I’ll keep these things in mind when I see others struggling.    [end]
[start] I feel for you brother Rob. I'm sorry he had to go through that . I have been through depression myself and my girlfriend has herself. Shits tough. My personal reason was cuz from a young age I have seen my mum go through kidney failure and I have the disease myself. Currently I'm taking a gap semester and waiting for surgery. I'm no longer depressed I got over that by the time I was 17 fortunately. But yeah I'm just sharing a little bit. Best of luck to you and your family.  [end]
[start] Today is for Rob💕  [end]
[start] My sincerest condolences for you and your family, friend.  [end]

[start] Done and done in the memory of Rob. I am sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] So sorry for your loss. This is such a wonderful idea that could really make a difference. I also lost my brother to depression. I would like to do this as well on his birth and death dates. Maybe it will catch on and you will have started a movement! This is for you Rob [end]
[start] I wrote a message to my best friends dad, he doesn't struggle with depression, but my best friend did and lost his fight too. my thoughts are with you and Rob.  [end]

[TITLE] Take it from a Grandma, you’re more of a fully functioning adult than you think [TITLE]
[start] I really needed this, thank you.  [end]
[start] Thank you. Being an adult can be pretty hard sometimes. But I guess accepting the struggle is where some kind of peace with oneself and life lies.  [end]
[start] You definitely reached people with this. Even if they don't comment. But for me personally? Thank you so so much. I do feel like I'm falling apart. Life has felt like it's in shambles lately and financially I am screwed. I'm in a hospital, I've alienated my family, my credit is an absolute disaster, and I'm struggling to be published as a writer, which some days feels impossible. But this filled my tank again. I needed you. Thank you. Bless you, Grandma. [end]
[start] Aww, thanks Grandma! This resonated with me.  [end]
[start] At age forty, I’m still wrestling with a lot of the same; it’s just on a new level: how do I balance my family, career, and self. How do I make sure I have skills relevant as my industry changes so I can pursue greater roles and higher income to send kids to college and retire or pursue a more leisurely career? How do I invest the savings I have so it’s more useful later? How do I overcome this or that about myself so I do better at whatever?  Many days I feel I’m on the right track. Others I’m questioning my choices and actions, doubting just how good I really am. The key there is regularly taking stock of what you’ve gotten right and learning quickly from what you haven’t.  One of the greatest lessons I’ve learned is mentors: we’re always working on something, and the best way to grow is through the advice and support of others. I’m always on the lookout for those folks, and I’m always looking for others whom I can help. [end]
[start] I really needed this. Really perfect timing. Thank you! [end]
[start] We need more people like you in the world. Thanks so much. [end]
[start] Thank you, Miss. I guess I needed your advice myself.  Posts like this are making reddit a better place. [end]
[start] thank you for sharing! i feel a lot like the girl (early-ish 20s myself) and what you wrote reassured me that my worries now will be temporary and i will pull through - all it takes is time, sometimes. and i guess i gotta be ready for the adjusting and readjusting i’ll have to face in the future - nice to have that “headstart”! [end]
[start] Thank you! [end]
[start] Thank you so much for this post! I'm 28 and still learning every day about work, relationships and figuring out what happens next, but it does feel less scary the older I get.  This was really helpful just when I needed it. :)   [end]
[start] Awesome words of wisdom to read just before I sleep. Thank you for this! ❤ [end]
[start] The last three weeks have been especially hard for me. This really helped  Thank you  For taking the time to write this and being one of the few adults to tell us that it’s ok to not be completely on top of our shit. The pressure from other adults who seem like they know what they’re doing are one of the reasons I feel like I’m a failure.  [end]
[start] This will be in r/bestof here in a few.  I love this post so much. I'm 32 and I'm starting my life over. Makes me feel a lot better having read this. [end]
[start] Thanks, Nan! [end]
[start] Thank you so much for this.     I went through the best and most challenging year of my life lately.     Had a good job, an abusive girlfriend and no sense of agency in my life. We broke up, she left my place and I've had the best summer in years (saw my friends, made new one, had great parties). Now I am trying to find a new job in a field which will make me happy.      I've worked in finance for years and never felt good about going to work. Then I met this girl which I've dated for about a month. She had a terrible salary (just a bit enough to pay her bills) and worked long hours, but loved it with a strong passion. Seeing her, so driven, committed, made me realise I need to find something like her.      In a twist of fate, she broke up with me but left me with a legacy no girlfriend ever gave me; motivation.  I've never really felt like an adult (late 20's) but now, reading your post and looking at myself, I kinda see how to become one.      [end]
[start] the timing of this post is crazy. exactly what i needed to read right now. thank you.  [end]
[start] The biggest thing I've learned in 49 years is unless it's truly life or death, in the grand scheme of things, it's not a big deal. Things have a way of working out.  Enjoy the now . Too many of us put off enjoying our lives saying, 'Well, when ____ happens, then I can _____'  You dont get those days back, live them while you have them. Laugh every day. It truly does help your state of mind. Love and respect yourself and each other.  [end]
[start] > Eventually we’ll all just be names without faces on Ancestry.com, so we have to live for ourselves.  A wonderful sentiment that I wish to echo. Life is brief but beautiful and even though other people can be unreliable, you'll always be by your own side.  You've got to live for yourself, whatever that life might be, whatever those struggles might be. Do it for you.  Thanks for the writing this post up OP, I'm sure you touched a lot of people's hearts and minds today. [end]
[start] Thanks for this. I constantly worry I'm not doing the right things in life. I have a great job and make good money, but work is all I ever do. I feel as if I will regret spending my youth just working.  [end]
[start] Can I get an amen! [end]
[start] This is a beautiful post! I’m currently in my final year of university ( 20) and feeling so many mixed emotions of feeling excited but also so nervous of going out in the real world   I’m slowly learning to enjoy the journey rather than stressing so much about the future and feeling like I am failing before life has even started!! [end]
[start] My grandma passed away a couple of years ago and I've never needed her more for guidance and reassurance that I'm on the right track than right now. There are a lot of crossroads on my path in the near future, so knowing that it is supposed to be like that sometimes is the sort of mental hurdle she would have been able to help me get past.  I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time out of your day to share this. I know I really needed it and I know that there are so many more young adults that do too. It's nice to know someone is rooting for us! [end]
[start] I was dubious that you were actually a 70-year-old grandma, so I checked your post history. Your last two posts are in threads about sewing machines and carrying candy to give to children, so I have to say, I'm convinced. [end]
[start] I only had to read half this post and it gave me a good realisation, that if you're worrying about whether you're doing good enough it's a good start because either you realise your mistakes, or you realise there's room for improvement.  Very well written, gave me a mini-epiphany of some kind. [end]

[start] At the start of 2018, everything was a mess for me. My health was rapidly getting worse (both mental and physical), and since my health was declining, all other aspects of my life suffered - even something as basic as eating felt like a lot of work. I stopped working for a full month at all of my projects, I stopped and time kept moving.  And when you are in that mental state, you never stop thinking how you have disappointed every single person in your life, and that is of course, not true.   I won't say I feel amazing today, but I do feel a whole lot better since that time. When you feel like everything is out of your control - take it step by step. You don't need to do anything more than one thing at a time, and let them be small things, at first. They will accumulate to bigger things before you know it.  Thank you, Gran. I'll keep this in mind.  [end]
[start] Absolutely struck. This was a beautiful read. [end]
[start] The "privilege of agency" bit is what I try and articulate to people in /r/relationships who are having problems with their family being overbearing in one fashion or another.  Its absolutely freeing to realize that you are allowed to act on your own with regards to decisions about your life. Other people trying to intervene and bring you down don't have to stress you out because of the privilege of agency you so wonderfully articulated.  I've loved being an adult for this reason alone. It can be scary at first but once you realize you possess the ability to run your own life, you feel more prepared to deal with whatever comes your way.  Thanks for sharing!  [end]
[start] This was very well said, I just sent it to my daughter. Thanks! :) [end]
[start] Beautiful. Thanks for sharing this. I think a lot of folks, myself included, needed to hear it.  [end]

[start] Thank you so much for this. <3 I'm 22 and it feels like I'll never get my life together sometimes. I'm so impatient and just want to have some stability - I've been working so hard since I was 16 but I have nothing to show for it. Or maybe I do, but my self worth is so low, I can't recognize it. But reading this made me feel more at ease. You are a blessing. Much love to you. [end]
[start] Thank you for this.  I’m closer to 40 than I ever imagined I’d get. Some days I feel like my life is perfect, together and I’m on top of the world.  A few days later I have a bunch of loads of laundry to do, nothing to cook and bills I forgot to pay.  But it’s all good because I’m doing it and life goes on.   [end]
[start] This is wonderful. I’m 20, in college, and barely hanging on when it come to keeping up with expenses. I was literally just venting to my girlfriend explaining how I’m in the verge of being broke, how I feel like I’m not doing well in any of my classes (even though we’re only 3 weeks into the semester) and how my plans for a future job are getting shot to hell because of huge federal budget cuts to everything that has to do with the environment. I needed this though. I find comfort in this knowing that someone of your age still struggles occasionally. So thank you for this.  [end]
[start] Awesome. Thank you for reaching out and sharing. [end]
[start] This is great advice, I accredit a large amount of my stability as a young adult to my mother conveying this to me early on.  There relevant xkcd is https://xkcd.com/150/ [end]

[start] My grattitude for an amazing post. Im only 30 now but I have come to realize  that this is life. Even the worst of times will be looked back upon at sometime and I always wonder why I even worried. Focusing on dealing with things as they come and not worrying about things in the future that are out of my control helped immensely with staying on the rails. I wish there were more people like you out there sharing positivity and experience with others. Learning isnt always as easy as reading or understanding it takes real experience and im joyful for you sharing your experience with us. Thank you again. [end]

[start] Any advice on finding happiness?  I feel like I'm doing everything right day-to-day, but at the end of the day I'm not happy.  I have a plenty of career options, but none of them excite me anymore.  I have a loving girlfriend, but I don't feel passion and never have, and plenty of friends, but they don't give my life meaning.  I try hobbies, but nothing seems to matter enough for me to keep with them.  I just can't seem to find joy in anything but wasting time and it's really got me depressed.  I've tried talking to a therapist about it, and even that has been useless.  I just want life to matter. [end]
[start] Thank you so much. I'm going to save this and come back to read it when everything gets too overwhelming. [end]

[start] I know most of the comments say that they really needed this, but damn I really needed this. I started a new, very high pressure role at my job today. I'm just waiting for when they figure out I don't have a clue what I'm doing. I come home so tired that the house stays a mess and I want to sleep at like 8.  Thank you for sharing that there's no magical moment I missed out on where I'd just have my shit together. [end]
[start] I wish there was some sort of "how-to" book for maturity things like this. Everyone on Earth must run into issues like having a system to clean their house or choosing whether to continue a relationship.  But I've never seen a book for how to be a mature, capable person. There's books about specifics, like finances, but never in general. [end]

[start] I'm with you, /u/ligamentary .... life is about moving from one set of problems to a better set of problems.  That's pretty much it.     I add to your observations that it is over before you know it, you don't need to ask permission to do the right thing, that someday means "never" to nearly everyone, that nothing changes until you change something.  And that no one, literally no one, is in charge of your happiness but you.  The universe does not care if you die today.     This is it.   Not a rehearsal. The real world is right here and right now.    Life is beautiful. We all sit in the big chair when it comes to our life.  /u/ligamentary is wise and kind and smart.  I love that she took time to share her observations with us.    Good stuff.    [end]

[start] Grandma you definitely brought this young man to tears. As someone who just got out of college, moved out of home, lives alone, and is trying to get out of all that debt from college, I've felt overwhelmed. With no more tips than just keep making more money. You've reminded me that life is day by day. It's okay to struggle, and to learn from those struggles. I'd say your the best grandmother but I still got 2 beating you haha. Thank you! [end]

[start] A question for you: my end goal for work (in a stable career for now) is to save enough money in investment accounts so that I no longer have to work. I enjoy my job and rarely not want to come in (or log in remotely), so it's not like I'm working something I hate so I don't have to work. But I don't really know what to do after I no longer need to work.   What does your life "revolve" around without having an obligation to show up somewhere or produce work for a job? Can you take me through a typical day? What goes through your mind during those days? [end]
[start] Don't forget to eat healthy and exercise. [end]
[start] Beautifully put! Thank you!    I'm gladly headed into my 50's and after a tumultuous decade in my 40's I'm finally coming to realize a lot of what you wrote.  It does get better, if only that you become at peace with yourself.  [end]
[start] This is amazing and so wonderful. I personally don't really have this problem of worrying that I'm not adulting well enough but it seems to be extremely prevalent in our society today.  Truly we need to remember that we are all just trying our best and that things really do seem to work out in the end. I also feel very very strongly that social media plays a HUGE part in so many people feeling inadequate.   Stop looking at what others are doing all the time! Focus on yourself and doing your best and try to discover those things that you just love about yourself and your life! We aren't all 20 something budding geniuses/millionaires/artists/activists. It's perfectly fine to be normal and it's perfectly possible to be happy being so! [end]

[start] > Wherever you are in life, just keep moving forward and trying to make decisions that feel right. At its core, that’s all there is to being a proper adult.  Unfortunately, that's where I think a lot of people get this very wrong. To me, being an adult is deciding between the **right** thing to do and the **smart** thing to do, and living with the consequences.  The problem with making the **right** choice, is that you can be dead wrong and not know it. It's really easy to convince yourself that you are doing the "right" thing. For many people, the "right" thing to do was to vote for the guy talking about building a wall on the Mexico border and renegotiating NAFTA. Turns out, both of those things have serious consequences. But where are those people now? Still convinced they made the "right" choice.,,  Nobody likes doing the "smart" thing. The smart thing is to take your kids home after the big softball game, make them a healthy dinner, and put them to bed early. The right thing to do is to take them to McDonald's for a celebratory soft serve ice cream and a happy meal with 1500 empty calories and 50 grams of sugar. The smart thing to do is to keep your mouth shut when you see the customer berating your coworker who is 55 years old and is being "too slow" for their liking. The right thing to do is to give that obnoxious customer a piece of your mind and slap them across the face. The smart thing to do when you get a bonus at work is pay off your credit card debts and put 20% of that money away into savings. The right thing to do is reward yourself with all your hard work and buy that new F150 truck you've always wanted, fully loaded with the lease package at a low $150/month. I could go on and on...  Telling people to "make the decision that makes them feel right" is about the stupidest, non-prudent thing I can think of. But the sad thing is, that even if you make all the smart decisions in life, you could still get screwed. Too many people who jog 30 minutes a day and don't eat red meat get struck down with cancer before the age of 50, while chronic chainsmokers who eat bacon for breakfast everyday live to 95. Life doesn't make sense, and the problem is that doing the "right" thing usually makes you feel real good, whereas the "smart" thing doesn't feel all that great. But either way, you have to live with it. So, be careful when you tell someone to do the thing that "feels right". Because more often then not, that person you're giving advice to is a complete moron. [end]
[TITLE] I was married for 7 years from 2009 to 2016. My wife passed away that year and I still haven’t gotten fully over it. Finally I had the courage to join a Bereavement Group and I’m so proud of myself [TITLE]
[start] My wife died in 2009. I remarried last week.  My new wife is super sweet and very supportive.  She understands that I sometimes get sad and miss my deceased wife. [end]
[start] I'm proud of you, too! [end]
[start] I love you, friend. No one ever asked for this. You have a right to continue your life and should feel the same for wanting your significant other to live theirs should something ever were to happen to you. You are doing the right thing by joining a support group. Once you understand that with time you will heal by growing; you can do this, too. [end]
[start] You never fully recover.   But in time, you can find a meaningful life. [end]
[start] Well done, and so sorry for your loss.  I hope things get easier for you. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry for you loss. I’m proud of you. [end]
[start] Good for you. I lost mine in 2013, but could never bring myself to join a group. Hope it helps you. [end]
[start] You're doin great. Take whatever time you need. Feel free to send a DM if you want to chat. [end]
[start] I hope the Bereavement Group helps you heal a little.  Loss is never easy and it will always be a part of you, but you took a big step in seeking help.  Great job! [end]
[start] Good for you for seeking out some help.   You definitely shouldn’t feel bad about taking time grieving. It’s a big loss, and 3 years isn’t a long time at all. You lost a love and the future you had envisioned together. That’s a tremendous loss and it’s absolutely appropriate to feel that for a long while. You may never get “fully” over it, and that’s ok. You can find joy and meaning in life, even with the grief. The grief might even start to become a sort of friend. A reminder that life is meaningful and sadly short sometimes, and that living as best we can is all we can do.   You’re doing great. Sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] Yeah, I think I need to find one. My wife passed nearly 2 years ago and I still feel lost and broken. [end]
[start] Life is so short. Makes me wonder what I’m waiting for sometimes. Keep your chin up you got this. [end]
[start] My biggest fear is losing my husband I don’t think I could go on without him. So for surviving, I AM PROUD OF YOU. And for making that next step & joining the bereavement group, I AM EVEN MORE PROUD OF YOU! Sending you love and hugs from Texas ❤️ [end]
[start] You’re amazing, I’m also very proud of you! [end]
[start] We are all so proud of you too 🙌 [end]
[start] That's really great.  I think people that have gone through any significant loss, trauma or issue shouldn't be afraid of counciling, treament or therapy that suits them.  Hope you have a great healing process and grow.  You're doing great. [end]
[start] I'm so sorry for your loss and so proud of your huge step forward! I wish you all the best! [end]

[start] god bless! this is a new chapter, embrace it and make the best of it. [end]

[start] Sorry for your loss. You should be proud!! That's an achievement! 💯✨ [end]
[start] I am so sorry for your loss. I'm really glad you decided to take this step. When my daughter passed on, I was reluctant to join the Group, didn't feel I could contribute...all I ever wanted to do is talk about my daughter... I wish I did join - shared experiences are actually what helps... [end]
[start] Congrats! There is NO shame in asking for help! I wish others can stop shaming people for seeking psychological help. Support groups are a HUGE help because then you won't feel so isolated in your pain and maybe even make some like minded friends. My condolences as well! [end]
[start] I’m so proud of you!!! That’s not an easy step to take by any means!!! Sending you hugs and much encouragement!!! [end]
[start] Sending you all the love and peace that you deserve. Good luck with the group, I hope it's able to help you on your path to healing ❤️ [end]

[start] So very sorry for your loss.  Also sorry your part of the club. Everyone eventually joins the grief and loss club. Some of us earlier than others.  Bereavement group helped me on my journey and there is a light at the end of the tunnel. DM me if you need to chat.  Best of luck. [end]
[start] I’m proud of you too! It takes so much courage to finally push through the sadness and want to try and find peace and happiness again. You will. I also saw you’re celebrating sobriety, too. Awesome as hec! You’re amazing. I hope things get much easier for you and you recover. You deserve it! [end]
[start] I’m proud of you. I hope the group is helpful to you! [end]
[start] Stay strong 💪 good step! Great job! [end]
[start] Proud of you and sorry for your loss Keep things going as they are and they'll get better [end]
[start] I'm sorry for your hurt, but I'm proud of you for taking a step towards healing. [end]
[start] The 1st steps the hardest, stay strong [end]
[start] I'm proud of you too. [end]
[start] Well played man! [end]
[start] KEYS！ [end]
[start] Very proud of you! [end]
[start] Although you'll never get over the loss, your grief will eventually "settle" and find its own place in your life.  Things will cause it to re surface, like birthdays, anniversaries, etc., or a song or a smell.  That's the price you pay for having loved someone. [end]
[start] I am proud of you too.  It takes courage to admit we need help.  They are no tried and true ways to grieve.  Grief is the price we pay to love.  Who better to hold your heart then others who know your pain.  All the best to you. [end]
[start] Sorry for your loss. I am super proud of you. And I'm sure your wife is very proud of you too! Sometimes getting support is extremely difficult. Glad you are able to seek that support. I wish the best 👍 [end]
[start] Wow that must be so hard. You should be proud indeed! [end]
[start] Time to go chase some booty.  Heads up - guys are eating booty now [end]
[start] If it was you who died and her who lived, would she have went through the same thing? Probably not! [end]

Everyone had a different way of coping (mine was weird haha, I would see how many Cheerios I could stack on top of one another), and I hope you find yours. Praying, sending good vibes, bless you, (whatever you believe in and whoever you lean on) for you. [end]

[start] Keep it up you can do it. I will believe in you! [end]
[start] I love you ❤️❤️❤️ [end]
[start] I just want to tell you I am so so proud of you. I self harmed from the time I was 13 until I was 15. I stopped for a few months then started again. After that I did it on a regular basis until I was 19, in fact until last september when I left my abusive relationship I told myself I was leaving the self hate behind. It has been so hard, I know what you're going through. I'm so so proud of you. [end]
[start] 9 years free here. You are awesome! You can do this and it feels so good 😊💕 [end]
[start] This post made me feel guilty feel good, good work & keep it up. [end]
[start] 2 years as of the 25th of June. It’s hard. You definitely should be proud of yourself. [end]
[start] Shit may seem bleak, and some people really are the god damn worst, but there are people that care and look out for those that need it. I am very happy for you, and wish you the best. I hope that you find someone to talk to, and I am very sure that you will. It may take time, but one thing always leads to another. Stay positive amigo 🤜🤛 [end]
[start] You're not only doing a great thing for yourself, you may inspire others with your example. You really have so much to give now. [end]
[start] 💕 I wish you a happy life with no more dark places [end]

[start] Well done dude! That's such a success! You got this! [end]
[start] You’ll see the fruits of later, I don’t know who you are but this post made me smile! [end]
[start] This is SO IMPORTANT I’m so happy for you! And I’m happy you posted such a Major accomplishment. Someone is gonna see this and see how well you’re doing and how proud you are and they’ll see all the encouragement- this goes a long way. People helping people. People need people.   Keep on keeping on! FOUR months is a long time. Happy happy happy for you. [end]
[start] Nice dude. [end]
[start] For some people its sometimes hard to love and respect oneself. Tje realisation that one treats others better than oneself is a weird one.  Really happy for you there.  Wish you all the best in the future, mate =] [end]
[start] I don't know if you know about the band Twenty One Pilots but we fans have a section called r/CliqueSupport and you can still come and celebrate. Everyone is recovering or has recovered from things such as self harm, suicide, depression, etc. We are always encouraging and also high fiving people who have overcome. I think you are amazing and though I don't know you I am so very proud of you. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] 😁💗💗💗 [end]
[start] Good for you [end]
[start] Hey congrats! The last time I self-harmed was 2 weeks ago and I'm hoping that is the last time for me as well! Stay strong :) [end]
[start] Congratulations! That is amazing! [end]
[start] What an amazing feeling. I didn’t make a milestone of it as i should have, but i recognize the feeling of conquering something within yourself. You’re doing great [end]
[start] Fuck yes!!!!!! Let’s push for a year!! [end]
[start] So proud of you! Keep up the good work! [end]
[start] Proud of you, several years clean myself. Keep working on it ✌️ [end]
[start] THATS AMAZING DUDE! I DONT KNOW WHO YOU ARE BUT IM SO PROUD! [end]
[start] Congratulations! That number is only going to grow, my friend. I'm at 10 months right now, and it's a freeing thought for me everyday. Happy for and proud of you! [end]
[start] You should be incredibly proud of yourself. That is a huge accomplishment!🤩 [end]
[start] As you fcking should! Keep up the excellent work and if no one told you this, I’m extremely proud of you! I love you!❤️❤️❤️ [end]
[start] That’s a great achievement , not easy but sure as eggs are eggs it’s worth the effort. Hope you are waking up to the endless possibilities of a clean head ! [end]
[start] I know personally how difficult is it to get out of a mindset that causes self-harm. I’m so proud of you and so happy you’re safer now. [end]
[start] aww that's a big achievement!! ♥ Even I have been free of self-harm for almost a year now. I've learned that life is tough, real tough. But running away from it isn't a solution. And it's okay to feel down at times. Just know that there are people who actually care for you. Whether it's someone close to you, or maybe just a passerby.  tc :) [end]
[start] I’m really happy for you!!!! You did a great job getting here!! [end]
[start] I’m so proud of you! I’m also on the road to recovery and I know it can be really hard, especially when panic attacks come. I just found out about this thing called the butterfly project, I don’t know if you have heard about it but instead of harming yourself your draw a butterfly instead in the same place and name it after someone who you care about. I think it is so you don’t cut the butterfly but I don’t really know. It’s helped me a bit and it really reminds me how much I can regret the aftermath of harming myself sometimes, but with this you don’t have to regret it because it’s not really there. So proud of you because I know how hard it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💕💕💕 [end]
[start] I'm so very proud of you! I very deeply and truly understand where you're at right now and I am proud of you. Stay strong but don't beat yourself up if your mind wanders back to those thoughts. You can keep doing this! [end]
[start] Thank you! [end]
[start] What do you mean by self-harm? Could you show me some examples? [end]
[start] so proud of you! [end]
[TITLE] My grandmother died of Coronavirus in April. Today would have been her birthday. Struggling a lot. Please wear a mask to protect yourself and others. [TITLE]
[start] That’s tough. I’m really sorry my friend. A lot of people don’t care until it effects them unfortunately [end]
[start] My beautiful grandmother has been in the hospital almost since this began with an injury to her hip. She hasn't had a single family visit because of lockdown. She lost her mother and sixteen year old sister to smallpox when she was 11 years old, and she missed them her whole long life. My heart is broken because she cant see us.  I am very sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] So sorry for your loss, wishing you peace and healing.💔 [end]
[start] Especially if you have coughing/sneezing symptoms. A mask is most effective when being worn by an ill person. They definitely help if you aren't sick yet, too, but for the love of God please wear one if you've got a persistent cough.  To OP, I'm sorry that happened. I'm sending internet hugs your way! [end]
[start] I am so sorry OP, losing a loved one is never easy and especially in these sorts of circumstances it's even more difficult. Just celebrate her, her life and all you learned from her. I will think of you and her everytime I put my mask on today! [end]
[start] Damn man, that one must hurt a lot. I’d probably put on a couple of her favorite movies, or just music & cry my heart out to it. At least for today. Always helpful rather than bottling it up.   How old would she have been? [end]
[start] I lost my grandmother (she was 83) 2 days ago to COVID as well. I really wish people would take things more seriously.   It's really a difficult place to be in. I am really sorry for your loss *\*virtual hug\** [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Sorry to hear. I lost my grandmother Tuesday to the same damn thing. I’ll pray for you. [end]
[start] I am so sorry for your loss :( My Grandmother passed recently (not COVID related) and it has been painful. She spent the last 3 months alone because of COVID, and we think that contributed to her rapid decline (she was terminal). We celebrated her Birthday on the 22nd and she was gone the next day.  Really sucks losing a loved one, especially considering I live across country right now. Traveling gave me so much anxiety, but I had to be there with my family.  Stay strong! [end]
[start] Sending virtual hug 🤗🤗🤗 [end]
[start] I’m so sorry. My dad has it and I know your pain. [end]
[start] Wasn't from Covid but I had a grandmother who oddly would also be celebrating her b-day today. Her body gave out on her a couple years ago. [end]
[start] ❤️ Ok.. I will xx [end]
[start] Big bear hugs. Take it easy. [end]
[start] I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my grandma to lung cancer in April.  I carry sanitizer, wear a mask, and carry extras. [end]
[start] Oh honey I am so sorry. This is exactly why I am staying home today. You're in my thoughts. [end]
[start] I’m sorry!!! Hoping the fun memories of her warms your heart!! ❤️ [end]
[start] Truly sorry for your loss mate! [end]
[start] Today IS her birthday. She was still born on this day and you can celebrate that fact even though she's past on. Happy birthday grandma theymightdrown (....ok your username makes that sound bad...) [end]
[start] #Most masks dont protect you, only others!  Keep a healthy distance from people that arent wearing masks, even if you do!  More people need to know this..  Thank you for sharing this, its tragic that stuff like this needs to happen for people to take this shit seriously, i genuinely hope you are with loving people that care for you, OP <3 [end]
[start] I am sorry for your loss  :( losing someone that is dear to us is hard. We must learn not to live without them, but to live with the love they left behind.   These feelings can’t break you. They’re painful and deliberating but you can sit with them and eventually it will pass maybe not immediately but sometime soon, they are going to fade away and when they do you’ll look back at this moment and laugh for having doubted your resilience. I know it feels unbearable right now, but keep breathing... This will pass.I promise it will pass  Stat safe and healthy all the time :) sending virtual hugss [end]
[start] I am truly sorry. My thoughts are with you. [end]
[start] On 9/11 terrorist act there were less than 3000 people died and the country came together and went to war and still fighting today. The US spent trillions of dollars and thousand of more lives to protect American.  Now COVID-19 already killed 120,000+ Americans and the country is divided and fighting against each other.  The army was mobilized and issued bayonet to be used against American peaceful protesters in DC.  What is the different between 9/11 and now, the President. One united the people to fight a common enemy and one divided the country to fight each other. American unity is at its lowest point and we are now more susceptible to foreign intervention more than ever before. [end]
[start] Hang in there, I'm sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] Lost my mother too last February (not covid though). It's really tough. Honestly we'll never get over if we lost the ones we love the most. All we can do now is to be strong, to always remember them and honor their last wishes. I'm very sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] Sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] So sorry you lost someone so special to you. Sending hugs and good wishes your way ♥️ [end]
[start] I'm sorry your struggling with this. Losing someone you love is so hard. I know this may sound cheesy but their memory will speak to you in times you least expect it. Her lessons and your love for her will keep her spirit alive and every so often when you dream she may visit for the times you feel you've lost.  This is how i still connect with one of my grandmother's who died in a time i was really struggling. It gives me hope and even though i know she isn't really there it is comforting to feel that hopefully feeling.   I'm sure she was really special. I hope the people in your life will cover up. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry ❤️ [end]
[start] 95% of people in my country don’t wear a mask at all, they are assholes, although we don’t have a high number of REPORTED cases (300 or something ), it’s still a fact that the virus is out there [end]
[start] Yes, we have done that, definitely better than nothing. [end]
[start] Can do! So sorry for your loss. Always try to remember the fun times together. [end]
[start] I’m sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] So sorry for your loss, OP and others here as well. Lost my grandmother to COVID yesterday. Heartbreaking way to go, and to lose someone you love. Stay strong. [end]
[start] Sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing the importance of wearing a mask 😷 [end]
[start] I lost my dad to covid on April as well. On Easter and his birthday was later that month. I feel you. Stay strong and know that there are so many people who do care about you and about others health and safety. Love you. [end]
[start] I can’t imagine losing my nana. I’m so sorry. Carry her love with you always [end]
[start] I'm sorry, OP. I'm worried and angry every day that my last living grandparent will be lost to this. I'm so sorry for your loss.  Happy birthday to your Grandmother.  I'd be happy listen to any memories you want to share. [end]
[start] I am so sorry to hear this. Sounds like she was special to you. I wish everyone would wear masks and practice social distancing.. [end]
[start] How old? [end]

[start] Sorry for your lost, hang in there. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry, and I wish you and your family the best. Losing people is tough, and it must be some much worse because it’s someone’s fault, somewhere. [end]

[TITLE] Today I heard a tiny baby laughing in the store over his mom’s shoulder, so I turned to look at him and smiled. And then he smiled back with his cute lil no-teeth smile and waved his tiny hand at me. And my heart melted. That made my day. [TITLE]
[start] Kids are magic.  You lose appreciation for the little things in life, then kids make it all new and shiny again. When they aren't being little assholes. [end]
[start] When i was shopping yesterday the exact same thing happened to me. I saw a baby with her mother and she just stared at me for like 2 secs and then i smiled at her and she gave me the most ADORABLE smile ever omg 😍😍😍 and when the mother started to walk away the baby KEPT STARING AT ME 😂❤️❤️❤️ [end]
[start] I love when things like this happens. It’s such a good reminder to find joy in all things, especially the little ones :) [end]
[start] I love it when a baby I don’t know smiles or waves at me. It does make your day. [end]
[start] Where's that gif of the little girl hugging people at the market? [end]
[start] I always smile and wave to the babies I see at the store or wherever. And I will talk to any kid that wants to talk to me. Just today I was behind a mom with 3 boys in the checkout at the grocery store. When one of the boys responded to my smile we talked about the tooth he lost that day and he showed me how he could whistle through the gap. Mom didn't say anything but you could tell she had her hands full and didn't mind me occupying his time for a few minutes. And the cutest little girl gave me big smiles right before that. Always makes the grocery shopping easier. .. [end]
[start] I read somewhere to always smile at babies, it makes them feel that the world is a safe place.  Poor little baes, they have plenty of time to grow up and face harsh realities, but while they’re babies the world is their oyster. [end]
[start] 👶 [end]
[start] Did you tell the mom? I used to have stranger's come up to me everywhere i went with my son telling me this very thing. I loved it!! It always makes me feel so much better. Made me feel like I was doing something right. [end]
[start] My little 2 year old nephew calls me guncle instead of uncle and when im around he'll just randomly go 'hi guncle' and doesnt stop until i say hi back. Its the most heart warming thing ever [end]
[start] Makes me feel really special when a baby acknowledges me like that cos you know they're not old enough to be nice just out of politeness, if they smile at you it's legit and just cos they really liked you haha [end]
[start] By no means am I a fan of kids, but it is impossible to be anything less than enchanted when a baby waves at you. [end]
[start] There is no sound more beautiful than a baby’s laughter. It totally makes my day when I hear it when I’m out somewhere. [end]
[start] He probably won’t remember this day, but I’m sure you made him happy at the time, just with a smile. Kids love to be, and should be, acknowledged. [end]
[start] :) [end]
[start] For a second, I thought this was TwoSentenceHorror [end]
[start] Kids are crazy. They are like, tiny people. [end]
[start] When i was a busser, one day there was a couple with their toddler eating , but the toddler was restless and wouldnt stop moving. I started playing peekaboo with him and got him to stay still. As they left they said they left extra on the table for me, but the server took it, i didnt care. [end]
[start] I love babies 😊 [end]
[start] I do that sometimes...but as a man I wonder if some people think I'm just being creepy [end]
[start] Oh hell the gummy smiles! My youngest is 2 and has her baby teeth so I often forget that a relatively short time ago she was still rockin' the gums. Babies are so freaking adorable! [end]
[start] This makes me smile so much 😍   My one year old son is such an affectionate kid, smiles all the time, lives to just wave and say hi and lately he blows kisses to EVERYONE. It makes me happy to think he may have made someone's day just by doing so 😁 [end]
[start] I love doing this too! But sometimes the mom is scary, turn to me and glare as if I planned to kidnap her kid or something. But once the mom ended up asking questions and offered and MLM lol [end]
[start] This is absolutely one of my favorite parts about going out shopping. I love getting babies to smile and giggle and babble. I used to worry parents might think I was a creeper for "trying" to interact with their kid, but overall it seems like they enjoy it and think it's cute too. [end]
[start] That's adorable [end]
[start] Babies will do that to you. I have one and she makes me melt everyday even on days she drives me crazy. Baby smiles are really the cutest even when they have funny teeth 😂 [end]
[start] Kid at the laundromat the other day randomly told me "hi, bye, I'm going to walmart" lol [end]
[start] Yeah, I had something similar today, I was riding bike then at the traffic, a small baby saw me smiled and waved his hand I waved back and before that moment I was sad, very sad and after that thing happened to me, I was really happy and it made my entire day. [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] Awwww [end]
[start] I'm glad you found some joy in your day. [end]
[start] I'm imagining an IRL version of Tommy Pickles. So cute. [end]
[start] This is wholesome [end]
[start] 2 little girls in a wagon waved at me and said hi when I was on my way to class.  They were so cute! [end]
[start] Once when i was with my previous gf we were at a peiwei and there was this young family with a young kid. He kept looking at my gf and i was joking with her that the kid liked her and she said no. The kid runs up and blows a kiss at her and runs back to his parents and it was the funniest and cutest thing i’ve ever seen. [end]
[start] So sweet 🥰 [end]
[start] awww thats so sweet [end]
[start] Priceless moments.... [end]
[start] Babies all look like Louie Anderson to me. [end]
[start] I'm so fugly, they either cry or turn their faces away if I happen to look at one. [end]
[start] You mean you didn't tip toe up to him and throw your hands out real wide and say BBBLLLAAAAGH!And scare the living shit out of him? [end]
[TITLE] I just have to brag on my self. I am very very proud of myself and no one to share it with. I’m only 27 and I have worked my ass and saved 28k for myself. Go me! [TITLE]
[start] Thats amazing well done, i hope to be able to be able to save like that. Do you have any tips on how to save? [end]
[start] I know a guy who can turn that into $800. Me. [end]
[start] That’s amazing!!!! I managed to save up nearly 2k at once point. That shit isn’t easy. You’ve worked hard! That’s a great security cushion. Especially if you have big financial goals, like buying a car/owning a home. [end]
[start] Last time the bottom fell out of the economy I bought my first house for 1/3rd what it's worth now. [end]
[start] 28k fuck yeah that’s awesome [end]
[start] Nice! Congratulations your efforts paid off. [end]
[start] Congrats. You are way ahead of the medians.  Owning a home boosts wealth long term so think about it if not already there. And investing in the broader stock market.  Keep going.  I started my first job at 27k a year and with saving 10% plus and investing it’s a bigger amount today than I ever thought I’d have now 30 years later.  The fact that you’ve accomplished this means you’ll accomplish a heck of a lot more if you stick with your approach.  Good luck and happy to provide any further advice if you need.  I’ve made some investing mistakes at times and can share my experience and advice if it helps. [end]
[start] I had also saved a a lot then used it to buy a house (((insert crying emoji))) it’s the best thing ever but then disappears so quick! Congrats! Keep saving!!! [end]
[start] That's a great achievement.  I know because because I also had significant savings by my late twenties.  The hard part is avoiding the mindset in which you keep thinking of ways you can spend it.    Invest it for the long term.  Consider buying Exchange Traded Funds which mirror market indices, and have very low fees compared to managed funds. [end]
[start] Im 27 too. Done nothing for 10 years (no study, never worked). All my money is 40€. Suicide is next.  I guess if I'm the yang, you're the yin. The universe needs opposites I guess... [end]
[start] That's awesome! I had a great job at 28 and didn't manage to save anything until I was almost 38.   I regret not being more financially responsible back in the day.   It really makes a difference saving from the beginning.   Find someone who can manage that for you though.   Keeping that in a checking account with no interest is potential profit lost. [end]
[start] Good job. Keep bragging on yourself to yourself because in the end, you only need to answer to the man in the mirror. Keep up the good work! [end]
[start] That’s awesome! I would dump it into Tesla. [end]
[start] Well now you have to tell us how you did it. We want to be like you. :)  Edit: a big fat congrats & well done!! [end]
[start] Congrats.  Did you know you can turn that 28k into 280k over at r/wallstreetbets?  😎 [end]
[start] Well done there from a fellow 27yo. [end]
[start] Bad economy right now unfortunately but my advice would be buy a house and fix it up and sell it.  And repeat. [end]
[start] Keep it safe from yourself. [end]
[start] Yolo it all on spy puts [end]
[start] Yes, Go You..... So happy for you! [end]
[start] That’s awesome! [end]
[start] Well done!🎉🎉 [end]
[start] Congrats, well done! [end]
[start] Go you! [end]
[start] I’m proud of you! ❤️ [end]
[start] That’s right! You should be proud of yourself! [end]
[start] That’s amazing!! Well done!! You should be more than proud! It’s hard work and you did it all, no one else, you !! Keep going, the sky is the limit for you!! [end]
[start] holy shit that's awesome man  keep it up and don't waste your hard work! [end]
[start] Proud of you for working hard for a goal! [end]
[start] Congrats! That’s a huge accomplishment right there. You’re definitely inspirational to me. I’m 32 and I struggle to save a emergency fund. [end]
[start] Damn that is awesome! Good job! [end]
[start] Yes! That is awesome! Keep going, and treat yourself a little bit. [end]
[start] Get in, mate. Not easy to save that much. Always a comfort to be able to know you've got a financial safety line, especially in times like these. [end]
[start] Congrats! I'm 26 and dont even have half of that. Im very impressed and jealous! Great for you and keep it up! [end]
[start] I’m proud of you, that’s absolutely fucking awesome! [end]
[start] Yessssss [end]
[start] Did you have roommates or how did you afford rent up until then? My rent and bills eat up all my checks. [end]
[start] YES LETS GOO proud of u OP [end]
[start] Way to go! [end]
[start] Well done! [end]
[start] Congratulations! Now invest in a 401k or IRA. Invest at least 2K per year. I started this at 25. If you do this (was so difficult when I was young!) you will be shocked by your retirement fund one day! [end]
[start] You're a fucking legend man. I'm 40k in debt, I wish I could have your determination in saving! [end]
[start] Ya I would say the best way to save money is to AUTOMATICALLY have money transferred from your checking account to you’re retirement account, savings account, stock portfolio, or anywhere else you won’t touch it.  Do this on the day you get paid and you won’t even feel it [end]
[start] That is incredibly impressive! I thought I was doing well just saving $4k at 27 but wow I’m gonna push myself to work to save more! Congrats and thanks for the motivation! [end]
[start] Nice now go buy yourself some bitcoin and double your money champ [end]
[start] Amazing!!! Congratulations 🍾🎉🎈🎊 keep going!!! [end]
[start] That's brilliant. I'm 27 and on my way to that too. Well done you. [end]
[start] good job bro 👍🏼 when did you start saving? [end]
[start] Congratulations OP! You have every right to be proud and happy! [end]
[start] Next try and get a sense of timing, lmao. We're in a major depression with millions unemployed waiting in breadlines for the opportunity to buy bread. It's shittier than socialism out here. [end]
[start] Keep going.. don’t brag.. you shouldn’t be telling anyone how much money you have!.. good work but don’t stop now.. keep creating wealth! Go you! [end]
[start] Fuck!! Well done man, you’re definitely allowed to brag! [end]
[start] Dude I'm 27 and have saved about 2k, I'm so jealous haha well done dude it ain't easy out there!! [end]
[start] You should invest it to make your savings an asset now its only becoming worth less and less [end]
[start] Go You indeed. Well done. [end]
[start] My bro is good at saving like you. He’s around 27 and he has like 36-40k in the bank. [end]
[start] But some ali baba stock my dude. That shit is going to the moon. [end]
[start] Good for you!!! And even greater job BRAGGING ON YOURSELF!!!   I AM SO GLAD YOU KNOW THAT YOU DESERVE IT!!!!   &#x200B;  <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 best wishes to you!! & you're very bright and exciting future!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 [end]
[start] Hell yeah! You  should  be  proud! I don't  even  know  you  and  I'm proud. [end]
[start] Dowa that count debts?  Arw you debt free and 28k out of the hole?  Congrats! [end]
[start] Hey that's good on you. Congrats! [end]
[start] Congrats :) [end]
[start] Amazing job! [end]
[start] big ups [end]
[start] Just in time for the asteroid to hit! [end]
[start] gratz. I have been cheap and saving money and investing conservatively for 25 years. Its nice to have a nest egg. It helps with stress. If you get laid off you have money to live off of. If you get sick you have some money for health care. Emergency fund, etc...   Key to saving money is to never think you are rich. Rich is when you can live off of the returns of your income and have enough to put back in so they go up faster than inflation. That is a lot of money. So never feel rich or you will spend your savings.   savings should only be spent in an emergency. [end]
[start] im 28 and only have close to 5k in my account good job man, im trying to save up for a house and still live at home. [end]
[start] You worked your ass to get the 28k? [end]
[start] You want a biscuit? [end]
[start] Go you!!!  Can I suggest investing maybe 5 to 10k split across the following shares and leave it for 3 to 5 years, no matter what happens to them in the meantime:  ZOOM, Appian, Microsoft, SLACK (ticker code: WORK), Splunk - all strong IT companies in remote working systems.   (I cannot accept any liability if you do follow my suggestion and I am not a financial adviser, but a 30year technical IT worker) - personally I invested in these over the last month and showing 25% return already.  I can see no way their value will drop as a combined set of shares. [end]

[start] shhh! no one tell op that women can be gay too. [end]
[start] I've always said homophobes spend more time and energy worrying about the dicks and anuses of more men than they might like to realize. [end]
[start] If you spend all day talking about where another man should put his penis. That's like, really gay. [end]
[start] Well he did it guys, he solved homophobia [end]
[start] If you think being gay is a choice then you're probably bi... [end]
[start] Homophobes are the gayest people. [end]
[start] great way of looking at it [end]
[start] Hahaha yes! I’ve always said this to people who are all weird about gays, “why are you so worried about other dude’s dicks??? How does it affect you if your neighbor is getting a hummer from his husband?” [end]
[start] “If you don’t want oil, you’re gay.”  -A president of the US probably [end]
[start] Isnt calling someone gay a sign of homophobia though? [end]
[start] Do you know about the anus inspections? [end]
[start] Local man solves homophobia [end]
[start] You are pretty gay. [end]
[start] when straight boys act gay. it means that they are confident with themselves. vs. when gay boys try to act straight it is just weird. Be comfy with who you love man, if anyone judges you, they are gay too. luv urself homies [end]
[start] Never understood why these people take so much of their time worrying about people beliefs, genders, sexual orientations. I mean isnt there anything more important in your lives than to worry about somebody elses business? Nobody asked you to watch gay people have sex [end]
[start] Wait thats illegal guy [end]
[start] Also ... I would never _occur_ to me that Gay Sex was something on which copious time must be spent writing laws describing all the different sorts of Gay Sex in order to ban Gay Sex so people aren't going around having Gay Sex and making people think about how much Gay Sex other people are having and how angering it is that other people are having Gay Sex and how one wishes those people would top having Gay Sex so that one did not have to constantly think about them having Gay Sex.  For me, my though process is more like "people have sex, cool."  Makes you wonder why they feel so strongly about it. [end]
[start] Bisexuals are gay but gays aren’t bisexuals ....IQ 1000.... [end]
[start] How many conservative anti gays has been caught with a dick that wasn't their own? [end]
[start] And why do homophobes spend so much time thinking about gay people and gay sex? It’s just a little bit suspicious [end]
[start] Being homophobic is gay because your letting a guy control your emotions like hes your bf [end]
[start] I’m going to print this out and hang it up for every truck driver I work with to see so they can stop with their bullshit. This will shut them up real quick. [end]

[start] Before the dictionary was edited for lingo and muffin top, gay meant happy and was also considered a name. [end]
[start] When you say pretty 'gay', is it meant as a derogatory term? If it's derogatory, aren't you implying that being gay is not cool. [end]
[start] I (40’sF) was once a right wing Christian (mormon) homophobe. Then my son came out to me. Then my daughter came out to me. Then I left the church. Then I became liberal. Huge 🏳️‍🌈 ally. Talk about a 180. Best thing that ever happened to me. [end]
[start] Wow the gender stereotyping in this post and comments [end]
[start] Gays there just serve as a strawman to unite some group against "external enemy." In fact hatred is a very strong uniting force, and the object of hatred can be anything, from gays to witches. For example, in Mao's China they hated sparrows, which were declared the enemies of the people and killed to local extinction. [end]
[start] Herek, Gregory M. (April 2004). ["Beyond 'Homophobia': Thinking About Sexual Prejudice and Stigma in the Twenty-First Century" (PDF)](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Herek_2004_SRSP.pdf). Sexuality Research and Social Policy. 1 (2): 6–24. doi:10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.6.  > It was in September of 1965, while preparing an invited speech for the East Coast Homophile Organizations (ECHO) banquet, that Weinberg hit upon the idea that would develop into homophobia. In an interview, he told me he was reflecting on the fact that many heterosexual psychoanalysts evinced strongly negative personal reactions to being around a homosexual in a nonclinical setting. It occurred to him that these reactions could be described as a phobia:3 “I coined the word homophobia to mean it was a phobia about homosexuals….It was a fear of homosexuals which seemed to be associated with a fear of contagion, a fear of reducing the things one fought for—home and family. It was a religious fear and it had led to great brutality as fear always does.”4  > Weinberg eventually discussed his idea with his friends Jack Nichols and Lige Clarke, gay activists who would be the first to use homophobia in an English language publication. They wrote a weekly column on gay topics in Screw magazine, a raunchy tabloid otherwise oriented to heterosexual men. In their May 23, 1969, column—to which Screw’s publisher, Al Goldstein, attached the headline “He-Man Horse Shit”—Nichols and Clarke used homophobia to refer to heterosexuals’ fears that others might think they are homosexual. Such fear, they wrote, limited men’s experiences by declaring off limits such “sissified” things as poetry, art, movement, and touching. Although that was the first printed occurrence of homophobia, Nichols told me emphatically that George Weinberg originated the term.5  > Weinberg’s first published use of homophobia came two years later in a July 19, 1971, article he wrote for Nichols’ newsweekly, Gay. Titled “Words for the New Culture,” the essay defined homophobia as “the dread of being in close quarters with homosexuals— and in the case of homosexuals themselves, self loathing.”   Although "homophobia" these days references any opposition to homosexuality the original coinage referenced, in short, three possible main types of homosexual related fear: a fear of homosexuals; a fear that others might regard one as homosexual; and a fear of homosexuality in oneself. Either way, as the terms suggests, the concept was of a fear of homosexuality (as an account for anti gay attitude and practice).   Herek would criticize the OP's use of "homophobia" and suggestion that "anit-gay laws and policies ... is gay" ... > The term’s limitations are discussed, including its underlying assumption that antigay prejudice is based mainly on fear and its inability to account for historical changes in how society regards homosexuality and heterosexuality as the bases for social identities.  Although the importance of Weinberg’s contribution should not be underestimated, a new vocabulary is needed to advance scholarship in this area ....  I haven't read the details but that project is broadly right. By continuing to conflate any anti-gay laws, policies, attitudes, and behaviour with a fear of homosexuality that misses a great deal of anti-gay laws, policies, attitudes, and behaviour that is not based on fear. That conflation undermines the aim of establishing the perfect freedom for anyone, in any part of the world, to be homosexual if they are so disposed.  This is to say nothing of the OP's (presumably inadvertent) implications that there are no gay women. Ironically erasing a whole class of homosexuals. [end]
[start] You’re gay, and that’s cool. I’m not. *Realizes they have nothing more to talk about*. I’m gonna walk away now. [end]
[start] yeah, we both know it doesn't work like that [end]
[start] Checkmate atheists! [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I'm okay with gay marriage and all that. But why do we have to have giant parades dedicated to being as perverted as possible in a public space? Why do we have to pretend like being gay is the norm, when it's really just a relatively common psychological quirk?  There's a fine line between lgbt education and lgbt indoctrination, and where you think that line is depends entirely on your subjective perspective. I don't want my kids to think it's normal to be gay. I want them to be happy whether they are gay or not, but I don't want the cultural zeitgeist to encourage them to pursue an alternative lifestyle. Kids are extremely malleable, as evidenced by the amount of people detransitioning who were convinced they were trans by well-meaning individuals. I don't want my kids to go through an identity crisis because they are convinced they are gay, then realize they were encouraged down the wrong path.  It's fine to be gay. Be gay to your heart's content. Just stop bringing attention to it. Give me more happily married gay couples in movies, and less fixation on the subject. [end]
[start] People can do whatever the fuck they wany. U the one worrying. Stop shaming folk [end]
[start] That statement is absurd.  First off,  policies and societal rules should not be made according to the desires of men's mindless dicks as some dicks tend to have desires that are downright immoral.  I don't know of any US policies that are anti gay-dick. [end]
[TITLE] My mother came back from the dead today [TITLE]
[start] Hang in there.  I get those, too.  Many times, too, where I'll have a dream where it “was all a mistake," and neither of my parents died - but then had to go through it again later (in the same dream).  Initially relieving, comforting, then horrifying, sad and ultimately totally disorienting upon awaking.  It sucks. [end]
[start] It’s been 8 years and I still have those dreams about my family. I’ve come to actually appreciate them bc it’s like a visit from them and that gives me comfort. It gets better I promise. You don’t ‘move on’ but you do move forward. [end]
[start] I have those dreams too. My Mom is walking on the beach or in a house with the rest of the family and everyone is acting like it’s normal. I am shocked that she’s alive and well but no one else seems to be surprised. Then I wake up realizing she’s dead and I sob and sob. [end]
[start] I had dreams once a week for a few years after my mom died. I’d meet her in this beautiful field under this tree and we’d hang out like we used to. And every time at the end of my dream, she’d tell me she “had to go but will see me at the tree again next week”. We’d pick up where we left off once a week in my dreams. I miss having those dreams about her. [end]
[start]  My old boyfriend will come into my dreams sometimes. It’s been five years since he passed (15 since we had been together) and it feels so real. I’ve hugged him sometimes and others I just can’t get to him and it’s really frustrating.  I used to hate when it happened because it felt like I was grieving all over again like it just happened. But now I sort of welcome them and am grateful for having someone in my life who meant so much to me.   Till we meet again... [end]
[start] Been 4 months since my mom's passing, been having a lot of "It was all a mistake" type of dreams [end]
[start] Those dreams are bitter sweet. It's wonderful to have your loved ones back in your life, but waking up to reality is so brutal. The dreams will stop happening as often, but they'll occasionally still pop up. Eventually, you get to the point that you know you're dreaming when your loved one is back, so you just enjoy the dream while it's happening, and you're not quite as sad when you wake up. At least, that's what has happened for me. [end]
[start] My mom passed away to cancer in May. Two nights ago I had a dream like everything was normal and she was happy and healthy again. I didn’t question it in my dream, I was so happy to see her face and hear we voice again. I’ve been very disoriented the past few days because of it. The dream made me realize she really is gone because I’ve been in a state is shock/denial since it happened. That dream was one of the best dreams I ever had but I can’t help feeling sad after waking up to reality... Love and peace to all of those who experience these situations. [end]
[start] I'm not going to lie, as someone who hasn't experienced this, your story and the other stories in this thread brought tears, OP. I just want to send hugs, and wish for your wellbeing. I have no idea what it's like that you're going through, but if you ever want to vent, feel free to message. [end]
[start] My sister had a similar experience after she had surgery. It was so real for her, that as she was shaking off the anesthesia, she asked the nurse to have her come back into the room. The nurse went out and told her family that she was asking for "Diane" to come back in. Mom's been gone since 2005.    I don't know if it was all in her mind. Logically, it makes sense that she was just tripping balls because of all the medicine in her system. But maybe... just maybe... Mom took a little time out of her journey through eternity to check in during a crtitical time in her daughter's life. I know that is not the logical thought process... but the other possibility makes me feel a little better. So I am going to keep believing that. [end]
[start] Right there in the feels... moms been gone for 4 years, and I was helping my brother in law move his mother in the assisted living, the feeling of peace and love from her just overwhelmed me and I had to go have a moment, because it was the same feeling I had when my mom hugged me.   His mother has known me for 25 years so she’s like a second mom to me.   It sucks... [end]
[start] I don't have these experiences as often any more.  There is more space between them as time passes.  I actually miss them now. [end]
[start] Oh man. Yes. My mother has shown up... I have many stories. What I will say is she's been dead 17 years now and my relationship has continued to grow and change with her. I'm sorry for your loss and glad that your mom brings a since of peace to you. Embrace these moments... And write them down! You will be glad you did. [end]
[start] I don’t know that what everyone is experiencing is a dream. I think your loved ones do get a chance to let you know they are with you. I think it happens more when you are relaxed and your mind is open and not cluttered with every day life. I’ve had it happen to me a few times and it was way more vivid than a dream. Count yourself lucky to have this experience. Not everyone gets them. [end]
[start] I had that for a bit after my Granny passed away. It's the WORST feeling when you realise that it was just a dream and they aren't really there. I feel for u x [end]
[start] Reading this walking through a store,  just makes me think about the only memories I have of my mom. She died 5 years ago (July 2014) after fighting breast cancer for 8 years. All I ever recall is the moments we shared that showed she was gonna be alright.   Watched Kershaw pitch his first no-hitter with me, eventhough she was a big Yankees fan.   Watched the LA Kings win the Stanley Cup in 2013.   The first 6 months of 2014 probably the hardest months of my life so far, knowing I'm leaving to USAF Basic Training and my mom just starts to fade.  She passed 5 days after I left for basic and at least once a month I cry about it.  Crying how I wish I could've given her a proper good bye, how I wish i could've done something more.   Wake up from dreams where I think she's gonna be there. Sometimes I forget what she sounded like and have to watch videos just to remind me that she was happy even through all the pain. [end]
[start] I know it’s hard that she’s not here with you in her physical body, but she’s still here with you in her spiritual body.  You can talk to her and be with her anytime you want and she’ll always be there watching out.  Her energy & spirit are very much alive 🙏 [end]
[start] I'm comforted when I dream of my mom. It'll get better. Just try to enjoy the feeling of being loved. [end]
[start] My estranged father died when I was 12. He lived on the other side of the country and we'd stopped even phone calls 6 months earlier after he had a tantrum on his birthday because I was late home from school to call him. That night he separated from his long term girlfriend and we heard nothing until his new finance called my mum to give her the news.  For the longest time, it didn't feel real. Nothing changed, so it had no tangible bearing. I'd often have dreams where he was still alive. The worst was when I had a dream where I fell in love with a girl and she turned out to be a paid spy from my dad... Wild.  I'm glad I don't dream of him any more. [end]
[start] all this thread made my cry  I wish your love and peace, and fast recovery [end]
[start] I'd give anything to see my dad again. [end]
[start] I have been thinking about my parents and grandparents dying, as I am getting older and seeing my parents less and less because of how far my school is and how busy I am. I realize how little time is left with  the people I love. This breaks my heart at the thought of losing my mom, I am so sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] I had that happen once. I wish I could hug you. [end]
[start] I’m nearly at my 6th anniversary of my momma passing. Still brings me to tears regularly. Tomorrow I hope you see this as a wonderful visit and it gives you peace that she’s ok and still walks beside you 💔 never alone. [end]
[start] I haven't had a dream like this yet. The dream itself sounds so nice. And I miss her so much I'm tempted to suffer through the waking up process, just to have any moments with her again. [end]
[start] You got a visit that many wish for, she’s always there for you❤️ [end]
[start] I’ve seen several of these posts. This happened to me a couple years after I got clean. I lost both of mine in my early twenties. Late kid. Cherish the fact you saw her again. Some people would love to have this happen one more time. I myself wasn’t sad, I was happy that I got to feel her hold my hand one last time [end]
[start] God bless you. May this dream eventually become a beautiful comforting peace instead of the amplifier of loss it is right now. [end]
[start] I have no doubt your mother came to you. My granddaddy did, I knew it was him because of the smell. His scent was always so comforting and warm. I’m covered me like a warm blanket. I don’t think you dreamed that experience, because of how strong you her smell hit you. Be blessed [end]
[start] There’s a quote from a book I read a few years back.   “The dead are never far from us. They're in our hearts and on our minds and in the end all that separates us from them is a single breath, one final puff of air.”  I’m so sorry for your loss. The ones we love are always with us; try to hold on to the happiness that she brought you. [end]
[start] I'm so sorry. That is a terrible hurt. Cherish the time you did have with her! That's a beautiful feeling. That means you will always carry her with you wherever you are!😢😢Hugs friend! [end]
[start] It gets better over time. Losing a parent isn't something we EVER get over but the pain subsides and we're left with happy memories.   What a bittersweet moment. Someone once told me that our loved ones come back to us in our sleep because they want to. I have recurring dreams about my mom and dad who died 38 years ago. I wake feeling very content. [end]
[start] After my dad died I had three dreams about him. In each one I was trying to convince people he wasn’t really gone. Each one more disturbing than the last.  So much so that I finally told my Mom about it. She quietly said “I know why. He’s still here. And he’s telling you that he is. He’s waiting on me”  And I quit having the dreams. I believe he was sending me a message and as soon as I figured out the message he quit visiting me.   I had one more dream about him. A 4th and final (so far) and he’s been gone 8 years now.   When I had the 4th I was in a motel. My cousin had gone into premature labor and her health wasn’t great. We drove up to be with them. My dad came to me in a dream and this time we sat and talked. He told me about all the people he was seeing and how great it was. Then told me he would be with my cousin and it would be fine.  I didn’t mention any of that... because why?? It wasn’t my day. Well she ended up going into an emergency c-section.   When she came out she called me over to her bed. She said she was so scared as they wheeled her into the operating room. She started singing Old Rugged Cross (my dad’s favorite hymn) and she calmed down. She said she knew he was with her and he let her know that everything would be ok.  I’m an atheist but I do believe there’s something after death. I believe my dad’s spirit has visited me and my cousin. And my mom is convinced he’s waiting to cross over with her. [end]
[start] So sorry for what youre going through. When My dad passed away, funny things would happen around the house, so he would remind me he is still there and joking around messing with me like he used to. When i was cooking, the lid would move and make a noise, stuff would be on othe places than dont  remember putting it there, and every time i laughed and thought yea dad, i know youre here. Its nice sometimes 😊 [end]
[start] I lost my father a few years ago; he was the last of my close family and it is still so devastating, especially at the holidays which will never again involve a gathering of my family. A few times, since then, I have had dreams where he was right by my side, talking to me, making me feel better, laughing his old laugh.  When I wake up, I don't feel more alone, or as if I lost him all over again. I feel comforted. Grateful to have had the experience. Secure in the knowledge that wherever he is now, a part of him is still alive with me.  I've learned to cherish these moments. When those times come that the feeling of missing my Dad punches me hard in the gut and I feel like I just want to curl into a ball and cry my eyes out, I think of those times. I think of his laugh. I think of how he comes to me in my dreams sometimes and talks to me just like nothing had ever happened. I may not know when or if it will ever happen again, but I know it did happen already, and I am grateful.   Maybe that last part of your dream, the part where you heard her walking around the house as if she never left, is the most important part to hold onto. Our loved ones are never far, and they come back to visit when they can. [end]
[start] I get those too, and it's been 9 years for me. I'm sorry for your pain and your loss [end]
[start] I anyways have dreams of my diceased father of 6 years and we hangout and talk and stuff. Just think of it as a little visit with your parent. It used to really upset me at first but now it's like oh my dad came to say hi to me last night and it was amazing to see him kind of thing. [end]
[start] I have these too. I sometimes dream that my father come back, and just told us he had to hide somewhere for a while but not anymore so he could come back with us.  And I would wake up. [end]
[start] Fuck [end]
[start] Hugs to you, my friend. ♥️ [end]
[start] I’ve had a similar experience and that feeling after you wake up knowing they aren’t there is the absolute worst. You are not alone ♥️ [end]
[start] I get these dreams too. They absolutely break my heart. [end]
[start] I lost my mom 18 years ago. I had a lot of those dreams. I would come home, and she would just be there. Just like she always had been. We would talk about regular stuff. Although I was always very sad once I woke up, I loved those dreams.   But over the years, those dreams became more and more rare. I haven't had a dream like tat for a while now and I miss them so much. It was like a little window where I could see my mom again. It's almost closed now. [end]
[start] One dream I had about my grandma and I remember being in shock because she was alive, but all I did was cry tears of joy as she spoke to me and hugged me and told me she missed me. I woke up in absolute anguish because I knew it was false, she was gone, there was no true reunion. It happened again the next night but this time I remembered and I knew she was just a Dream but I didn’t cry that time, instead I told her I missed her and I wished she could come back with me, and she told me she knew that I loved her but that she was always with me even though she was gone and that was the dream I woke up and felt comforted from. It happens to us all it seems, and it always seems to suck, but we get through it. [end]
[start] It’s been almost 8 years and I’ve had a few dreams like this about my dad. It is such a rollercoaster of emotions. I had one where my dad and I were hanging out drinking beers (something we never got to do in real life because he died when I was 17), and it was so fun. Then I “woke up” in the dream, realized it was a dream and was devastated. But then I heard my dad’s voice in the other room and thought that him dying had been a dream and THIS was real. Then I woke up for real and it hit me that he was truly gone. It was like losing him all over again twice. I felt like a zombie at work that day. But as sad as it is, it’s also kind of nice to see him again. I’m glad we go to have our beers.   Thanks for sharing your story and giving me a chance to share mine too. Time does help as you settle into life after death.  Sending hugs to everyone in this thread. We’re all in this shitty club together and we’re gonna be okay. [end]
[start] I get these with my great grandmother whom I was close to, who passed away last year. I’ve been dealing with a lot of coping with trauma and my therapy sessions are always leaving me exhausted, and almost every night after those I get to see her again, and she comforts me. [end]
[start] That's heartbreaking. I'm so, so sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] I am really sad at how this comment ended, I was really hoping you were going to say you felt loved and at peace. I am so sorry for your incredible loss. There is nothing on earth like the love of a parent. I wish you a speedy recovery from your surgery and that you feel less alone very soon. [end]
[start] Glad you got to be with her again ,but sorry for your loss..😇 [end]
[start] This made me cry. Thank you for sharing this beautiful dream with us [end]
[start] Dreams are a gift. Yes, they remind us of the harsh reality, but they also allow us a moment to escape it.   I hope you can find peace in this, that regardless of if you’re awake, you’ll still have more instances of seeing, hearing and smelling your mother again. [end]
[start] Thats so sad. Just be thankful knowing that she is with you even when you dont see her. [end]
[start] I'm so sorry you lost your mom! I lost my dad 5 years ago and I have dreams like that too. My dad never says anything in my dreams though. He's just there, usually busy doing something, but it always feels natural, like "Oh, there you are!" Several times I've gotten long deep hugs from him, always silent, but such a deep connection. and such a great comfort. Although they were extremely disturbing at first, now I always wake up feeling like I just had a great visit from him, and I find great comfort in them now. Hang in there. 5 years out and there are still times grief blindsides me, usually when I see or hear something that unexpectedly makes me think of him. It does get better with time though. You will continue to get hit with waves of grief, but the time in between becomes longer and longer and the the waves become less and less overwhelming. [end]
[start] Consider it a blessing. She came to visit you ❤️ Some people are lost and we can't even remember their smell, let alone see them in our wake.  It kind of goes along with the saying, "it's better to have loved and lost than have never have loved at all"  If anything, she's watching over you and she reminded you of something important, to take your meds. [end]
[start] This brought tears in my eyes.   My dad passed away 3 years ago but I remember having this very vivid dream, where I watched his van pull up onto our family homes driveway.  He was no longer sick so I hugged him and everything was ok and I was happy again. It was so real it made me so happy only to wake up with it all taken away from me....again.  I hope you find peace. [end]
[start] You were blessed with that special moment. Try not to be sad it's over. Be happy it happened. [end]
[start] i lost my dad two years ago and i still dream of him constantly. i like to think it’s them doing a quick check up on us. your mom visited you this morning!!! don’t feel alone ; she is always with you :) [end]
[start] I ask my late girlfriend to visit me every night. In the 18 months since she's been gone, she has come to me in my dreams twice. She told me she couldn't stay both times. I was very upset, and she just was very nonchalant. First, it was "you know me.. I had to go." Then, "I just don't think marriage would work out for us."  She looks at me with those big, beautiful eyes... and I wake up, sobbing. I miss you Tamara. I love you. [end]
[start]  As painful as those moments are I truly believe that she just wanted to checking and make sure you were ok. It is nice when people visit us because the reality of their passing can be so hard. Smile, she is still there watching over and caring for you even though she has passed. [end]
[start] Took me years to let go of my departed mother.  The first few months were filled with such incomparable loss, and it returns to me on occasion even though she has now been gone more than 10 years.  Next to the sheer weight of missing her, the toughest part is knowing I am now holding all of the responsibilities in my own hands with no one to fall back on.  Hit me hardest the day I realized she was in need of 24-hour assisted care and I knew only her meager assets and my ability to bring home a paycheck were all that was left between me having security or being on the streets. [end]
[start] Strong hallucinations .. Sorry for your loss though.. Stay strong [end]
[start] I had a dream just this afternoon about my aunt, she unexpectedly passed away two years ago. In the dream I remembered to call her because it was her birthday (she would have been 51 last week.) We talked on the phone for probably thirty minutes, she reminded me to take my medicine and told me not to worry about school, asked me about my new apartment, etc. It was so vivid and normal. I woke up and checked my call log, went outside and had a good cry. [end]
[start] This is so heartbreaking because those who do experience this are looked at in askance with disbelief. Last My late father and I talked was on Halloween. He knows it was our favorite holiday and we had a nice chat. Very surreal but overall good experience. [end]
[start] Im sorry.  She was very nice to you when she visited. :) sounds like a very good person. [end]
[start] Ugh this made me cry and also make me consciously aware that I have to take advantage of the time I have left with my mom. I’m saving some money to take her on a trip to Europe as she’s never been. I hope you have a quit recovery, thank you for sharing that moment with us. <3 [end]
[start] I get those dreams too, in the beginning they were always nightmares but eventually they turned in to really nice dreams about everyday life, it’s always painful to wake up and you feel the loss so strongly. [end]
[start] Reminder to say I love you to my mother when I get home from work [end]
[start] This was really sad to read and I wish I was there to just hug you and hold you. It does make me wonder if that tiny bit of happiness of having her for a few moments again is maybe worth the pain of feeling like you're losing her again? [end]
[start] I actually had a dream like this last night about my 17 year old cat who passed away. He jumped on my bed and snuggled my face and meowed. He really felt like he was actually there and when i woke up i also felt alone and empty. But i think thats spirits visiting and checking back in. [end]

[start] :( your post made me cry hard [end]
[start] I don't know if this is correct, but I've been trying to figure it out and this is what I have so far.  Spirits are on a higher level of existence and living people have their spirits tethered to their body.  When we die we become untethered and only exist at this higher level.  A spirit/soul can move wherever they want, and often family members will stay with loved ones, so long as they feel needed.  We can occasionally perceive them, because we are higher level beings.  It's often easier to perceive them if you have a "looser" tether, I.e. If you're sick, high, near death, young, or just naturally looser.  All this to say, it seems that your mother is still watching over you, and was there because you needed her.  Try to not feel sad, she still exists and is watching over you. [end]
[start] I think these are called visitation dreams. I had one after my nan died where she was smiling and happy. She looked right at me and I felt like she was telling me she was going to be ok. [end]
[start] What kind of surgery did you have? [end]
[start] She is watching over you. You aren't alone. Remember the good times, and she will remain with you. [end]
[start] I had those dreams for probably a good 10 years after my dad passed. Strangely my mom passed 2 years ago and I haven't really had any dreams with her that I can recall. I chalk it up to being in a better place in my life now where I was able to deal with it more easily while conscious. It gets better.. but it takes a while. [end]
[start] Our brains do some freaky shit sometimes that can both be soothing and disturbing. You probably needed to feel that comfort. Hang in there. [end]
[start] Just want to send a lot of warmth and hugs your way. [end]
[start] It’s been 8 years since my mom died. I will still have dreams with her in them. One dream happened when it was thundering outside really bad and I had a particularly fitful nights of sleep - my mom kept telling me not to go to work that day, that I wouldn’t be safe. So I called in. [end]
[start] I’ve never wanted to hug a stranger so bad. I’m so sorry. [end]
[start] She was there to tell you that you are NEVER Alone.  She is with you always. [end]
[start] She's with you. Hang in there. [end]
[start] I read this this morning and choked up. I have had these dreams for years. Almost 20 years since my love was hit by a drunk driver and killed. He comes to visit. The “dreams” are so clear, so now. I believe they are not dreams but moments when I am allowed to be in sync w the realm where he is now. He has saved my life by changing its course via discussions and warnings in these visits two or maybe three times.   But that desolation on waking is every bit as devastating and bewildering as getting the news was the first time. About five years ago, I asked him to give me some time. To not visit again until I ask. He has not. I will always love him. I asked him to visit again this year. He has not yet but I know he will. Fack I’m gonna bawl again. Anyways. Just letting you know what it is like for me so you will know you are not alone.   Losing parents is so very hard. You have my deepest sympathy. [end]
[start] heart wrenching. thinking of you. [end]
[start] Bless your heart. I lost my mother a few years back, and have had experiences similar to this. I’m glad you got that little bit of time with her, this story has touched my heart ❤️❤️❤️❤️ [end]
[start] THIS IS BEAITIFUL [end]
[start]  Hallucination happens with everyone. It's normal [end]
[TITLE] My date was late. Very late. [TITLE]
[start] >I saw her turn the corner of the building in a *full fucking sprint.* She didnt even see me at first, and just bolted it to the front door.  I'm glad you saw this epic scene OP. I'm sure she didn't mean to be late >.< [end]
[start] My husband was 2 hours late to our first date because he couldn't navigate our cities public transit system. I still give him* a hard time about it!  Edit: typo! (Sorry it took so long to fix) [end]
[start] that's sweet! Just try turning up 10 min late yourself from now on haha! [end]
[start] Sounds like she's just one of those people that naturally suck at being on time no matter how hard they try. It's kinda cute even though it can be frustrating! [end]
[start] On mine and my husbands first date I was late because I locked my door keys inside the house and had to scale my drainpipe in heels to get into my bedroom window to go back downstairs to grab my keys to leave again. Then I realised I was going to be late and I was walking so I started power walking in my heels.   When I made it to the other end of the road of the date I saw he was getting ready to leave as I was 15 mins late So I yelled his name and ran to cross the road and was hit by a car (I still laugh over this!) He had to drive me to hospital and our first date was spent with hospital jello while I had to get an x ray of my leg for me to find out that I broke my ankle and he drove me home and slept on my sofa for 7 days so he could bring me breakfast in the morning and stuff (he worked from his computer) He would help me down the stairs (I honestly could walk but the bloke felt so bad)  3 years later we got married ahahaha [end]
[start] You never know. It could be a great story to tell later on. [end]
[start] She works on drug dealer time.  I'll be there in 5 minutes bro!   30 minutes later..  Ya I'll be there in 5 minutes, stop hasslin' me. [end]
[start] initially i thought this is one of those 'girl thinks its cute to be late' stories, but the twist. intresting [end]
[start] Sounds like she's interested in you. [end]
[start] idk man she's a keeper, the fact that she was late but still tried to come sprinting shows she was interested in you [end]
[start] This is golden. I relate to her so hard and I hope you stay patient with her. [end]
[start] Busy girl who was rushing to see someone she feels good about,  squeezing something good into her busy life.  Keep us posted!!! [end]
[start] Ahhhh....my girl was 20-ish minutes late to our first date. We had met on tinder and I too was certain she had cold feet (we had prior cancelled plans the weekend before, in her defense, it was Father’s Day). I was sitting in the outside patio of a Starbucks where we were to meet when I was jarred by someone tapping my shoulder from behind. Looked behind and was unknowingly staring at my soul mate.  3 years later and I still to this day don’t know what I did (probably previous life) to get so lucky. Anyways congrats OP, good thing you caught her sprinting, shows she really did want to see you, just a late person. [end]
[start] I was 45 mins late for my first date with my now husband. He very nicely said let's pretend the date was for 9 instead of 8 and we are both early. Dealt with it very well. [end]
[start] When people prove themselves to be latecomers you can just tell them to meet 15 min earlier then you decide to come, this works great for me. [end]
[start] Lunch beers! Keeper! [end]
[start] I hate lateness and was wondering why you'd waste your time on this person who clearly doesn't value your time until:  >She also paid for the lunch beers :)  If lateness is her only major flaw, this makes up for it. [end]
[start] My girlfriend was VERY late to our second date...because she took the metra line in the wrong direction.   I still tease her about it 2 years later [end]
[start] thats actually so cute. [end]
[start] That's so sweet. Some people are just always late. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] That's adorable, that's the best possible outcome to the whole event. [end]
[start] I was going to go on a date with a chick. We agreed to meet at 7pm. It was an hour drive away, but whatever. I'd have to leave at 6pm to get there on time. I texted her a few times that day and never got a response. I wasn't going to drive an hour, and hope she'd be there after not responding to me for 10+ hours. I get a text at 7:08pm, 8 minutes AFTER our agreed meeting time, asking if I'm still going. She fell asleep, and missed the date. She was upset because she expected me to have gone anyway. Despite me not having heard from her all day. I thought it was pretty disrespectful to expect me to be there. So I told her I wasn't interested in meeting up anymore. I wished her good luck and to be safe. She sent me a text saying, "I didn't expect you to agree to meet me, but I'm not surprised you didn't come." This is when I lost my temper a bit and texted. "I got stood up, and it's my fault? Seriously though, I wish you good luck.".     I think I was a bit of an asshole, but I also think I dodged a bullet. [end]
[start] Women are allowed to be late. Wife tells me a time she will be ready and I add 30 minutes. [end]
[start] She might be one of those people who are always late. I have a good friend like this. It's surreal how bad he is at estimating time. And it's frustrating sometimes but mostly we are used to this. We just say to him to meet at 8 if we want to meet at 9.  Once he estimated he would be back in town at 6 pm and was back at 9 pm. For no other reason than bad estimation of his driving capabilities.   Cut her a slack if she does it again. She might have struggled all her life with this - getting on time to the meetings, interviews, dates, flights, etc.  Or maybe she was just unlucky and things did misalign and got in the way these days. [end]
[start] My wife is a bit add.  She used to be always late and often made us late.  We are 30 years older now and she is a lot better.  She was really bad at estimating how long something would take and an optimist.  At the last minute she would think of a thousand things that had to be done.  She would ask me to do something on the way to work and I'd have to tell her, the way you have scheduled things, every light would have to be green, there would have to be no traffic and no customers in line in front of me.  She would still think it was possible.  One way to know how they actually feel about you is to show up late yourself to somewhere they can not be late to, like their own home.  If they get upset about you being late, they are selfish not unorganized.   She can not estimate time to save her life, she is a great cook but have had our share of burnt food.  She is what she is. [end]
[start] This is adorable. Best of luck with her! [end]
[start] My mom was late to her own wedding! I think there had been a problem with one of the bridesmaids cars and they had to figure something out. A 45 minute late start and 20 years later, they’re still together and happy. [end]
[start] Recently I had to bail on a date because I shrunk all of my pants while washing/drying. Things happen. [end]
[start] You mean she actually showed up? I'd say that's a keeper [end]
[start] my SO is always late. if she seems the type that can take a bit of slagging remember it for the next time you arrange to meet up. if she picks a time just playfully say something like "ok cool i'll be there for [30 minutes more than arranged]". sounds like a nice moment glad you seen it OP. [end]
[start] I was an hour late or maybe more to my first date with my boyfriend (we lived hours apart and met in the middle in London, I missed my train) and I'm so glad he waited for me because we now live together and have a little baby bunny.  Sometimes things are worth the wait! [end]
[start] I think your date is a superhero constantly putting her life on hold to save the day, with not even a thank you, when you go to bed with her, know not to mention the whip and handcuffs, they're part of it [end]
[start] OHHHH I think I read the title and then went back about 3 times to realize how it said 'date' and not 'dad' and trying to figure out how dad fit in here  This makes a lot more sense..*thanks self* [end]
[start] Don't let this one go! Have waited 30 years for someone that cares that much [end]
[start] Adorable [end]
[start] The first date with my current girl friend was my first proper date in years, she was 40 mins late and I was just about to leave. I had sent he messages via the dating app and I assumed I’d been stood up. Turns out she couldn’t find a park and the dating app had stopped working, she had re installed it and all of her messages came through at once as I was about to leave. I am so glad I waited as long as I waited. My life has been so much fuller with her in it. [end]
[start] You really had me in the first half there... [end]
[start] Made me smile :) [end]
[start] Does she have ADHD? This sounds a lot like me! [end]
[start] I'm very finicky about being on time. In fact, my motto is "If I'm on time, then I'm late". I like to show up to lunch, appts, meetings, etc. 15-20 minutes early. My absolute best friend is the opposite. She is late...to everything. In fact, she was late to my wedding. And I didn't care. She doesn't do it purposely; that's just how she is. And I love her still! So if we agree to meet for lunch at 12:30, I show up at 12:15, grab a table and apps, then wait. She'll show up around 12:45 looking flustered. That's our friendship and that's who we are. Glad you're ok with your date! [end]
[start] aww [end]
[start] I completely understand your feelings there. This is so nice! [end]
[start] Hey if she’s a cool person but always late you just know that 12;30 means 12:45 not a huge deal [end]
[start] This is so sweet, I’m seriously smiling right now!   My boyfriend was 30 minutes late for our first date. We hadn’t even exchanged numbers yet, we were chatting through the app we matched on. Normally I would have just left, but for some reason I didn’t. Four years later and still going strong! [end]
[start] Please give us an update in a couple of weeks on how's it going. Rooting for you. [end]
[start] Cuteee [end]
[start] Bet she’s a Pisces. 😂😂 [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] You should bring up the lateness and bring up that your time is valuable.inform her that she needs to make it up to you, invite her back to your place for drinks and make a move.. don’t be shy and don’t allow women to waste your time.. [end]
[TITLE] I have been offered crystal meth [TITLE]
[start] Well done mate. [end]
[start] Good on you. Do something for yourself this weekend that makes you happy, you deserve it. [end]
[start] This is actually pretty damn amazing!!  I know firsthand how hard it is to get & stay clean.  But, to be offered your drug of choice - in a private situation where no one would know - and TURN IT DOWN!!!  You, my friend, should be more than proud.   And, thank you for sharing this - it may very well give hope to others who are struggling with addiction. [end]
[start] Yeah I knocked back FREE weed a few weeks ago, not even "hey man you wanna hit this?" Like an old friend offered me a takeaway bag... cause she knew I was driving.   FREE TAKEAWAY NARCOTICS!   But my Fiance doesnt approve of drugs and I have a pretty hardcore addictive personality... its "only weed" but I can abuse anything. So slippery ass slope and all.   But good for you man, good for everyone cleaning their shit up.  [end]
[start] Fucking solid mate. Proper good job.  [end]
[start] Keep it up! Congrats [end]
[start] Fuck yeah! Go you!  [end]
[start] Congratulations,  man! That's awesome!!! [end]
[start] I’m very, very proud of you. Sometimes people get into the meth addiction and NEVER come out. Spend their lives looking for more and then getting so angry when they don’t have it. I’ve lost about 6 people to the shit. I saved 1 (my daughter) she looked like hell and at age 26 she was 68 pounds. Now she is beautiful, married to a man that also used, until he went to prison for 5 years. He lost his wife at that time and could not see his 2 sons they were 4&5 when he went in. So being he got out stayed clean and met my daughter (they both stayed clean) NOW HERE IS THE GOOD PART/THEY HAD THEIR FIRST BABY TOGETHER......Hey TWIN BOYS. My grandsons.They have a beautiful life now. She is a teacher and he is a coal miner. They are Avery good couple and those 2 boys, always smiling  [end]
[start] Good on you man, congrats [end]
[start] We’re proud of you. Keep it up.  [end]
[start] I’m proud of you! I know some very close friends who were addicted to hard drugs in the past life. They’ve overcome a lot, and I’m sure you have as well. [end]
[start] Well done man.  Is it too personal if I ask you if you smoke weed now? I find it interesting how some former addicts seem to get by smoking weed instead. [end]
[start] Congrats man. I still have a hard time saying no to a cigarette, I can't imagine the willpower it takes to say no to meth (from what I hear). Keep it up and kudos to you [end]
[start] Jesus christ I hope that doesn't happen to me. I hope I'm as strong as you but you never really know until it happens. I've been off that stuff for about 5 years now. Intend to stay that way.  [end]
[start] You are my hero of the day. [end]
[start] legend  &#x200B; [end]
[start] A test was presented and you passed. Good job! [end]
[start] That takes serious inner strength. I know this holds no candle to yours, but I can’t even say no to an ice cream. You’re a stronger person than I.  [end]
[start] Awesome! The area I live in is so bad with hard drugs, it’s heartbreaking. I know too many people who are sucked up in that lifestyle. Some try to get away, but it never lasts more than a few months. I only know a few people who have completely stayed away. I know it’s not an easy escape. Which says a lot about you. You are stronger, smarter, and worthy. Congratulations man!  [end]
[start] Proud of your self control mate, well done. Go out and enjoy yourself this weekend, peace. [end]
[start] Fweeze this is the DEA pwut yow hands up. Oops wwong houwse. [end]
[start] Congrats! But now I really want to see that beautiful view.  Next time add a picture  [end]
[start] This random internet stranger is proud of you. Good job! You saw past the short term to the longer term negative effects and rightly said nope. [end]
[start] Fuck yeah! 👍 [end]
[start] Congratulations on being this powerful!   [end]
[start] Was a meth addict for three years the first year and a half injection user, next year and a half, every three months having a relapse by snorting for a day or two. Was a long three years. Kicked the habit been about a year clean. Congrats, it’s super fucking difficult to kick. Had I known what I was getting into Jesus Christ, I would’ve done every fucking last things differently. Again congratulations stay strong. [end]
[start] Nice work man. Not today.  [end]
[start] Sometimes when I hear a strange story like this I think about my friends idea that the universe is a teacher, letting you make the same mistakes.  What are the chances some random person offers you crystal meth?  I can honestly say I have never been randomly offered crystal meth in my entire life, in fact I have never even seen it.  Pretty wild that happened to you. [end]
[start] Good job! [end]
[start] Good job! [end]
[start] High five [end]
[start] Nice work. That view you where looking at, is real.  I had been clean for 7 years. I injured my back 7 weeks ago,  and have since, had the most debilitating chronic , Sciatic nerve pain. Tried all therapy- even had an epidural ect ect .. No pain relief. I’m prescribed Lyrica 300mg- a drug for nerve pain. ( opioids don’t touch nerve pain) - which is the highest dose.  My neighbors across the Street sell gear, always cars coming and going.  Anyway, bout 6 weeks ago, out of know where, I thought about gear, and I swear to god, the next thing I knew ,I was back and in the house with a gram, and a ten pack of fits. It was just one action. I barely remember doing it. I was to far in , for any rational thought to makes its way to my conscience. That door was closed. I have used every single day since, at a cost of 150$ a day. Every day, just like years ago, I think “ I will just finish off this bag, and tomorrow I’ll put this shit behind me”.  Fuck it’s hard to stop. I forgot what it was like.  What a fuckin idiot I am.  ( doesn’t even help with the pain) yet I kept using.  The Lyrica even acts as a blocker, to the stimulant ( 50%) yet I have kept using.  It’s nearly takin all of my savings , yet I continue to use.  So... reading your post, I just had to make a comment. I’m very happy for you. And, because of your strong choice, u may have just inspired me, to pull my head out of my asse, and Stop this madness. 🙏  [end]

[start] Very proud. struggling with a cocaine addiction right know but I've told a few friends and my doctor is referring me to an addiction specialist. Coming clean (pun intended) made it real and made it so I have to address it. No more mental gymnastics.  [end]

[start] Well done! Was his name Jesse? [end]
[start] I am happy for you. There's nothing sweeter than the taste of freedom you make for yourself free from addiction and vices. [end]
[start] Awesome!!!  Very happy for you and proud of you!  I would HATE if my husband did drugs, ( and spent money on it) and booze.  We were both binge drinkers but we both stopped it.  If one of us still drank, it would be hell.  You will grow stronger with the decision you made.  Good job! [end]
[start] Congrats man! Was just at a friends wedding in Hawaii and somebody gave me a free bag of coke at a bar. Instead of immediately running away and doing the whole bag myself, I gave it to the bride and groom. This is massive for me considering I used to slam speedballs all day. 3 years clean next month!!!! 😊 [end]
[start] Congrats! I'm proud of you! [end]
[start] Damn dude! I’m so proud of you. Reading this brought a huge smile to my face. Keep it up.  [end]
[start] Good on you. [end]
[start] Awesome job !  And remember to Kill your local drug dealer 😁 [end]
[start] Good on you for staying strong and clean. For real.  [end]
[start] Me too, Be proud of your choice. I’m proud of you. And I wish others the same. I think the hardest part is changing the friendships you used to have. Make a good example! I wish I Could posterboard. My daughter THIS IS HER 10 YEARS AGO, AND THIS IS HER NOW.!  Send hope  [end]
[start] You’re a boss  [end]
[start] That's a weird coincidence... Try and escape your current circle, m'dude. [end]
[start] XD [end]
[start] This made me smile. [end]
[start] Good job! Proud of you!  [end]
[start] That’s amazing. I wish you the best in life, as you have just passed the biggest test. You deserve to pat yourself on the back.  [end]
[start] I like this. Good on you. [end]
[start] Be Proud of yourself my friend, really proud.  [end]
[start] That's amazing. Im a year and eight months clean from drugs, booze....cigarettes.  yay me! Yay you. [end]
[start] I am so proud of you! Even though you’re an internet stranger, you matter, and I am proud of you. And that was probably so incredibly difficult for you. Well done and keep making those good decisions.  [end]
[start] So effing proud of you! So flipping happy for you! You kick but man! 👊🏻 [end]
[start] You made the right choice. The internet approves! [end]
[start] Takes a hell of a lot of will power to get out of addiction. Good one on you. [end]
[start] That was A Temptation, you are very strong person, maybe you made him think a little bit. Stay clean, stay happy [end]
[start] Good on you. Stay strong. [end]
[start] High five [end]
[start] I’ve heard from CGKid on YouTube that if he stays in a room where either there is a meth pipe going around or a loaded meth pipe and no ones in the room with him for 5-10 minutes, he’s going to use. And he is sober from meth 7 years.   From what I know, that shit is too addicting.   Overwhelmingly and shit bat addicting.  [end]
[start] Fuck yeah. I’m so fucking proud of you.  [end]
[start] Do C.M have purity as shown in BB? [end]
[start] Just curious, what is your view on drugs now? [end]
[start] Good for you! You are making the right choices! Should you not want to share this with friends and family, know they would be very proud of you.  [end]
[start] Glad you could refuse.  [end]
[start] Well played [end]
[start] I wish someone offered me free drugs. They're expensive  [end]
[start] She ended up in the Doctors office after being sick to her stomach for 3 days. When they did blood work, they found the problem. The Dr. then called me into her office and said “your daughter is a danger to her own life”. The Dr. had a document on her desk that said, if I would sigh it. The Dr. signed it, gave me power of attorney over her, even though she was about 25 years old! Because she was a danger to herself. At that point when we got out of Dr. office. I stopped the car on a side street and strictly ask “okay can you do this on your own? Because if you don’t I will have her dad sell one of his many vehicles and I would sell her to rehab as far away from home as I could! She knew it was very possible. What helped me, is she had never been out of the tri-county alone.  Then I told her, IF she thought she could that I was going to give her drug test weekly by surprise and if she failed 1 she was going for a road trip. I drug tested her 3 times a week for about a month or so, no problem, then I went to 2 days a week for about 6 months. I watched her pee, so there would be no cheating.  She never once failed it.!!! She was scared of being away from her mom and dad in a strange location thousands of miles away. [end]
[start] I am so very proud of you! [end]
[start] Sooo.... Redit also is a place you can get therapy? Whoa, that’s great! Ahmmm. I have this thing about fucking women, I love it... I can’t help myself. Is that wrong?  [end]
[start] Hell yeah man! Stuff is garbage. I still struggle with temptation and your dedication is very motivating [end]
[start] Amazing. That takes some balls. Good for you. [end]
[start] Good for you buddy, now reward yourself with some meth [end]
[start] No one likes me enough to offer me drugs  [end]
[TITLE] The Coronavirus pandemic has saved my life. [TITLE]
[start] Sometimes we really need things to slow down so we can breathe and catch up. [end]
[start] Wait, where in the world do you get 800$\\week for unemployment? And at what conditions? [end]
[start] Adapt and overcome bro [end]
[start] Ride that wave, baby. [end]
[start] I think a lot of people probably find this forced break from their previous schedules are opening up their eyes to a lot of the ways in which their normal didn’t work for them, and I think that’s very interesting! I’m sure nobody truly is “happy” that millions of people are suffering from an infectious disease and that many people are hurting from the economic impact.   What’s cool is that this is forcing a lot of people’s into situations they wouldn’t have or couldn’t have done otherwise. Someone who has gotten laid off is realizing how much happier they are without the stress of that job (raises hand on this one), but if they hadn’t been fired wouldn’t have just quit out of the blue otherwise. I think it’s a unique situation for people to look at their lives a bit differently and maybe when all of this is over, they’ll be able to use that knowledge to create a new routine and a new life after this sort of forced reset. It’s quite interesting, I’m curious how society changes after this.   I’m glad you’re finding this forced break so beneficial for your mental health! That’s truly fantastic news and I hope you can carry the effects forward in a long lasting way! [end]
[start] Good for you! I kind of suspected that this would become a thing. Let's hope people notice. [end]
[start] Wait.. You can get more from unemployment than you were actually making while employed?? [end]
[start] It’s unfortunate it took a pandemic just for you to receive proper help. The pandemic flipped our lives overnight. We lost our jobs, I don’t qualify for unemployment, husband only gets $300 on unemployment. Bills and rent still need to be paid and unemployment doesn’t cover half of that stuff. Even with the extra $600 he’s just to receive, it will barely even cover the bills and his previous pay.   Starting over from scratch and we are depressed, anxious and terrified. I’m glad that you’re on the opposite end of this but I wish this pandemic never happened and it didn’t take this happening for you to get this help. My advice: save, save, save! Don’t fall for the lifestyle creep. Live within your means and maybe below it. Our savings is the only thing we have holding us right now. [end]
[start] Everything you have described, more than one person has been feeling/living and too afraid to say out loud. I’m glad you’re okay and seemingly thriving. [end]
[start] I’m so happy for you! [end]
[start] It’s kinda insane you’ll be making $800 a week on unemployment.   Don’t get me wrong, it’s fucking great. And I’m stoked for everyone getting that $600 weekly bonus.   But I’m temping at a grocery store working 40 hours a week exposing myself and my girlfriend to the virus and I don’t even make that much before taxes. Grocery stores are assholes. [end]
[start] Don’t blame yourself for feeling good about making progress. This was a great turnaround for you! I was in doubt about it happening to me too but when I saw your post I totally related with it. [end]
[start] There's no reason we all should suffer any more than we need to. Celebrate your wins! Well done. [end]
[start] “I made $100 a week”  You worked for Doc Antle? [end]
[start] Good for you my dude. I am glad you are feeling some stress lifted from your shoulders. I only wish we could be so kind to the people making less and being forced to work during this time. [end]
[start] I haven't applied for unemployment yet, but it sure is nice to take a breath once in a while. [end]
[start] I don’t understand how people are getting this much in benefits... I lost my job, both of them and was making about 4000 a month combined and get a weekly benefit of 345$ after tax it’s 289$ how in the hell is your benefit amount so much greater than mine?? I have never even taken a sick day in the past 7 years. [end]
[start] So nice to hear a good story like yours! Keep up the good work ! Don’t ever feel guilty for improving yourself pandemic or not, you need to take care of you 🙏 [end]
[start] Quarantine is helping me too in a way.  Glad to hear you're doing better. [end]
[start] That. Is the way the cookie crumbles. You're on the high end of the tide now, enjoy.     (it will crash again, and it will get nice again and it will get bad again etc.) [end]
[start] Oh my! I feel this myself. Not to the extent you do maybe (and I'm really happy for you -long may it continue), but I don't feel so exhausted all the time.   I'm still working (IT people are still considered key workers here), doing long hours, but I've got time to relax after work. My commute is however long it takes me to get downstairs to where I have my computer. I don't have to go and visit anyone, but we're all still in touch via video calls and the like. I am... content!  My only problem is that my daughter is cooking for me, and I'm getting FAT! [end]
[start] As fucked up as it sounds, money really is a factor in happiness. It doesn’t buy it outright, but it definitely takes off so much pressure and stress that it allows you to focus on what’s really important. [end]
[start] This is so encouraging, thanks for sharing! [end]
[start] I'm glad that there is some good coming out of this terrible pandemic! Good for you. :) [end]
[start] Reading this made me feel a little better and it gave me hope for the future. Thank you for sharing this. I’m happy that things are turning up for you :-) [end]
[start] Our country should work loke this in some ways. Not the forced isolation but we should be able to have the time to enjoy life and to take care of ourselves. Automation is to a point where it should be benefitting all of society by allowing profits to be spread throughout society. This distribution of funds will bolster idividual liberty and creative expression. Remember how times are now when they bark at us to get back to work. [end]
[start] This whole experience has definitely allowed me to use it as a “restart” [end]
[start] Sounds ace. You just needed time to catch up and have a breather! Rush, rush, rush...million miles an hour is just constant, so yeah a bit of a slow down is nice!  But the benefits you are receiving is insane. Totally don’t understand that. [end]
[start] I also feel like this on such an intimate level except I was sabotaging my own life. Sometimes the universe has to put a hard stop and reroute for you. Keep going! [end]
[start] This was nice to read. Kind of like a breath of fresh air. [end]
[start] #thanoswasntwrong [end]
[start] Finding so many grim silver linings coming from this pandemic [end]
[start] Finally, someone that can spell "quarantine" correctly.  Also, very happy for you. [end]
[start] Enjoy it my man, and don’t forget it. [end]
[start] Yeah, I’m an essential working making $300 a week barely. Shit sucks. [end]
[start] Don’t feel bad for catching a break, that doesn’t mean that you’re not sad for the people who are going through the worst time in their lives rn but there are people doing good everyday while you and others are going through hard times so it’s ok. However,start making plans now save as much of that money as you possibly can, look diligently for another/better job now (at least start  in the next week or so) because that unemployment will stop in 4 months (as of now anyway) and it will go back to what regular unemployment is which will only be around $100 a week, if not less. We’re able to get my little family back ahead now bc of quarantine as well bc of the stimulus check and bc my husband isn’t having to drive to work or spend money eating out or anything like that. But we know this isn’t going to last so we are planning ahead and I just wanted to put the idea out there so you don’t find yourself back in a tough position once this is over. Stay safe and I hope things keep going well for you. [end]
[start] A temporary “prop up” from the government is not a sustainable change in your lifestyle. This extra money at the moment will not allow you to keep this new place to live as the money is only a temporary fix and will not last past 6 months.  Great job in screwing up when thinking that you are being taken care, but will have $0 income in a few short months and bills you cannot afford.   The current education system is failing these generations. It’s sad to see really. [end]
[start] I'm glad at least something good is coming out of this. [end]
[start] Still working. Make less then those on unemployment right now. I really don't understand. [end]
[start] That’s more than I make as a paramedic. I need to get fired and let everybody fend for themselves [end]
[start] Making almost 400 more on unemployment than i am while working full time frustrates me -.- [end]
[start] \>  I spent so many hours wasting away in my bed believing that nothing would ever get better.  Sounds like you really put a lot of effort into trying to make things better. And now because of a devastating pandemic you're ~~making~~  getting 8X what you were making before and having to do less to get it. You really don't have the resources to support yourself, you have a very large group of people who are supporting you. Who do you think is going to pay for your good fortune? [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] I'm in the same situation, about to start making 5x the money I was making in a new position that came about because of this pandemic, finally solving a lot of my life problems. I feel like I'm finally moving forward after years [end]
[start] I feel this so much!!  I’m from Ontario Canada and I usually make give or take $2000 a month.  Well we are all getting $2000 a month for cerb (Canadian emergency response benefits) and I did my takes for the first time ever the day after I was laid off. Well apparently waiting 7 years to do you taxes can sometimes pay off. I have so far gotten almost $6000 in the last month.  I have gotten more money in the last month then I have in my entire life.  I’m eating better, sleeping better, enjoying my time with my fiancé, I was able to finally purchase a new mattress and box spring after sleeping on a broken mattress on the floor for the last 4 years. When this is all over I will be able to go get my license and pay off my hubby’s fines from before we met.  I feel terrible because so many people are suffering , getting sick or dying, and working there butts off and I’m doing better then I ever have in my life. Don’t worry OP your not alone. [end]
[start] 🥰💕💕 great story [end]
[start] I totally understand this. I was freaking out in March because my unemployment was ending, I only had a part time job and worried about how I was going to continue to pay my bills if I couldn’t get a second part time job. Because of the pandemic my part time job upped my hours, we received 2 weeks of 2.5x pay and now with this stimulus check coming soon that will be an extra buffer of money I will have to help me out. I also got a stipend check that was back dated to my hire date for a 2% raise.   I feel like as the world is on fire I am only gaining strength from this disaster. [end]
[start] I completely understand that. I was so stressed and overwhelmed and on the brink of another depressive state before all this. With online classes, my grades have gone up a lot. It was so stressful for me to have to deal with people and the social interaction every single day and not understanding what to say or what people think of me. I’m so much happier now. I have time to do other things now, like crochet, or play animal crossing, instead of just the constant loop of wake up-go to school-go home-play on phone-eat dinner-homework-bed-repeat. I’ve even started working out and dieting again. If I’m lucky, I can make it through the res rod the school year without going to school. [end]
[start] Congrats bro, you made it!! [end]
[start] Not quite saved my life but it’s caused the me to save a few thousand in interest on my loans.  Very thankful for that. [end]
[start] Mine too, but in a different way. I’m still employed, but am able to work 100% remotely. Funny how I was always capable of doing this only one day a week, but magically we can now do it Monday through Friday. I’m saving so much money by not having to buy gas (or when I do paying half the usual price per gallon). I’m getting back four hours per day not having to commute. I’m able to be home to cook meals for my family instead of relying on picking up something ready-made because I’m too exhausted at the end of the day to function. I’m also able to help my tiny roommates with their school work now—something I didn’t have a lot of patience for before.   It’s weird to think the world is crumbling outside of our home. [end]
[start] Glad to hear that good News are still a Thing this year. [end]
[start] Glad to hear it's working out for you. There are many including myself on the flip side due to this situation [end]
[start] Damn. I’m sorry. My fiancé is also laid off n cannot collect unemployment... he found a new job but is waiting on a background check that has already took a month and it won’t be done soon since everything is shutdown here.. but ya know bills n rent are still due 🤦🏻‍♀️. Good luck to you! [end]
[start] Super props on you!! That's fantastic! [end]
[start] I'm so glad it is getting better for you :) [end]
[start] Don't forget the 83 mods from r/Coronavirus [end]
[start] Awesome! Ive experienced struggles on a similar playing field in the past. Its even harder to go through struggles when they resurface in a different form. Stack money in a separate bank account just incase. Also, id my state denies unemployment if you’re in school so just be mindful if you disclose that. Unemployment was difficult to deal with prior pandemic. I don’t want to imagine how it would be dealing with problems with it now. [end]
[start] I’m really glad for you! Finally, some good news. [end]
[start] Dont get used to $800 a week. [end]
[start] This put such a big smile on my face man. Dont stop now you made it through [end]
[start] as someone who is really struggling to say the least, this made me happy to read. don't feel guilty, you'll waste your good fortune :) [end]
[start] For the first time in my life I  made friends and discovered new things. My diet is on point now, my routine has been maxxed. I am in all my 30 years feeling better then I ever have. This pandemic has made me love life so to speak. [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] I should also be making about $700/week with unemployment and the additional $600. I will make in 12 weeks in unemployment what I made for the entire year last year (2019), which is insane to me. [end]
[start] Definitely a reset. [end]
[start] Quarantine made things go from bad to worse for me. Things are still ok though, could be worse. I like being able to cook and stuff from home, I am quite good at it! But I won't be making any money until this is all over, and that's really screwing me over. [end]
[start] i was in a very similar situation years ago. i was failing out of college, getting in trouble with the law and regularly abusing drugs/alcohol. then suddenly some government programs changed and my student loads would cover a much bigger chunk of my living expenses. i was able to afford rent AND food. my stress levels dropped. i started doing well in school and actually applying myself. i got my degree and have built a decent career for myself. without that government help i don't know where i would have ended up but it would have been a drain on society and cost taxpayers much more than whatever the government programs cost. [end]
[start] Ah, money can solve all our problems it turns out! [end]
[start] I am so glad to hear this. One of my friends is in a similar place and I am glad that something good can come out of this mess. I hope this puts you ahead for a long time. I always think we should invest in people. Look at the return. [end]
[start] I won't go so far as to say it's saved my life, but it's certainly made it better. Just being able to telecommute every day and free up time for exercise and contemplation has been a godsend. I'm so much less stressed and now that I am getting the hang of video chats I don't even feel deprived socially.    This has been horrifying for so many people, but I think that's all the more reason for as many of us as possible to find the positive potential in our new reality. [end]
[start] A society where unemployment gives more money than being employed us doomed to fail, sooner or later. [end]
[start] The 600 a week representative working a 40 hour week at minimum wage.  To put it into perspective.  This is untaxed and does not include payroll , or Social security, or health care deductions, one normally sees in their paycheck.  Any one saying 600 a week isn't enough to live in, needs to assess the state of wages in the country. [end]
[start] There is no reason you should be getting $800 a week to do nothing when you made $100 a week prior. That's a sick joke. [end]
[start] I’m so proud of you. [end]

[TITLE] There is a black man currently serving 12 years in prison because they forgot to check his pockets for a cellphone [TITLE]
[start] 3 year minimum sentence and 15 year max sentence for possessing a cellphone in prison? Wtf? Why wouldnt that just be a "Confiscate it, leou" type thing? [end]
[start] Recently, I wonder every second what exactly am I doing in this world full of imbeciles.  Things like this just make me want to move to the mountains, far away from humanity.  Because this world is ridiculous.  Not just in the US. [end]
[start] [https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2020/04/10/mississippi-court-wont-undo-12-year-sentence-jail-phone/5129403002/](https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2020/04/10/mississippi-court-wont-undo-12-year-sentence-jail-phone/5129403002/) \-> still in there; appealed to US Supreme Court, I think. [end]
[start] Heathbreaking. Prison is an awful place, animalistic and cruel. Even a week in there can screw you up. Poor guy. [end]
[start] So, this is actually something that needs to be changed.  Black, white, or brown, no one should have been treated like this. [end]
[start] Aren’t guards the ones who smuggle contraband like phones in prison in the first place?? [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] What kills me, is that instead of trying to understand where people are coming from when they say that POC are treated unfairly, they use their own biased experience in an attempt to discredit the claim. [end]
[start] 12 just for a phone??? Meanwhile, criminals committing manslaughter getting far less [end]
[start] If he was white, the guard would have said "You can't have that in here" and taken it away. Case closed. It must really suck to be a POC in America. :-(  The US legal system is just as fucked as it's healthcare system. [end]
[start] If this was me. I would kill myself. Its disgusting and I would rather have nothing than 12 years of being treated like shit. Every story you hear like this the judge is a horrible person. [end]
[start] Can someone please tell me why no one is trying to get him out? [end]
[start] First of all why are we focusing on him having a phone when we should be focusing on how terrible the guards must be to let a smartphone slip by (unless they did it on purpose)  And second, who the actual f**k cares if a man held on a misdemeanor is texting? What’s the actual worse he can do? [end]
[start] Why.  Just why.  What do they get out of ruining someone else's life like this.   I hate this world so much. [end]
[start] I got arrested with a crystal in my bra. An actual crystal amythist I think. She padded me down and I told her about it and she said she didn't feel anything. Later when I was going to the cell and had to change into jumpers it fell out of my bra and had to give it to the police man. This obviously didn't get me in trouble but they obviously don't do thorough checks and don't listen to the people telling them things. It's so stupid. My heart goes out to this guy [end]
[start] Ok. How is this self, what does this have to do with you [end]
[start] I'm sorry, this may be a valid post, but how is this r/self material? [end]
[start] Oh well. The best way to avoid that is to not get arrested in the first place. [end]
[start] >There is a black man currently serving 12 years in prison because he is black  Fixed [end]
[start] Oh for fuck's sake.  [Read it all and read it twice if you have to](https://law.justia.com/cases/mississippi/supreme-court/2020/2018-ka-01587-sct.html).  Willie Nash is not some poor little boy who was done hard by the justice system because of his skin colour. **The decision to give him 12 years because of the phone was based on the original crime he committed, and his past offences.**  1. Nash later denied the phone was his despite asking for it to be charged up 2. The Court admits that there was likely a failure of protocol, but given Nash's previous crimes, this was one of those 'you fucked up too many times' punishments 3. Nash was a 'habitual offender' and had previously been sentenced to 7 years for burglary.  4. He will become eligible for parole after 3 years.  Yet another example of a criminal being pedestal'd to push politics. [end]
[start] We need to stop passing stupid laws to enforce. Vote for a party who wants to repeal more laws not add more to the books. [end]
[start] I was Born and raised in Mississippi, educated in Mississippi, have taught in Mississippi for many years and don’t want to live anywhere else... I have to say, sending this man to jail for 12 years for a cop not doing his job is terrible, horrible. Anyone whom the cops wanted to go to prison, just “forget” to confiscate the cell phone. COME ON MISSISSIPPI ... this is the crap that gives Mississippi a bad name! [end]
[start] 12 yrs for a phone? And yet we have psychos who literally kill people and get less time than that. Like the young 17 year old white girl a few years ago that killed a nurse down the street from me because she was drunk and high on coke, but she got  4 years... [end]
[start] The U.S. scares me.. I visited California, had a good look around & returned to my country with a huge sense of relief that I don't live in such an immoral, unjust plain NASTY place. Then there's tRump..Fucked. Really really Fucked!! [end]
[start] What can we do about this ? [end]
[start] Lmao. Commit widespread financial fraud and you pay a fine. [end]
[start] ... We had a civilian walk into the prison with a cellphone for an interview for a clerical job. She still got the job... We weren't happy because they fired a guy a few years earlier for forgetting to take off his Fitbit. [end]
[start] My blood is boiling at this moment. [end]
[start] See thats the problem. I didn't ask for and don't require your input.   Living in the US as a black person means constantly being dehumanized by other people, media, healthcare, the economy and pretty much every way.  And. Yes the euro-western governments and large populations of their people have made living any where in the world as a black person a difficult task, but don't try to tell me that I would feel less human and be less happy somewhere like Africa because I really couldn't.  Looking at our other thread of conversation you have a problem with black people and you let statistics mean more than the human. Your opinion means literally less than nothing to me. [end]
[start] But really how do you not know you're not supposed to have a phone in jail? [end]

[TITLE] Twenty-five years sober today. Don't really go to AA anymore but I still want to celebrate this moment. [TITLE]
[start] Congrats man!! This random stranger is proud!! Big achievement my dude. [end]
[start] congratulations! wow !  i am at 226 days.  maybe  tou could order a « jeton » or go to an exceptional meeting ?  You can be proud !!!!!!! [end]
[start] Way to go! I am so proud and happy to see this!  You really ought to think about taking in a meeting (or a few!) to share this accomplishment. Not only will they be happy to celebrate with you (and be able to recognize how big this is) but you could be such a great inspiration to people just starting out in the day to day struggle. [end]
[start] Congratulations...welcome to the ranks of long time sober folks. There are all kinds of long-timers out there. Me, for instance --15,892 days or 43 years, 6 months and 5 days, but who'se counting?  No matter the tally, we only have today, yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery. I too only go to AA occasionally, but use its tools daily.  Again, job well done, but it's not finished ye. [end]
[start] Congratulations! AA actually let me present my dad with his 25 year chip when I was younger. It was very emotional! [end]
[start] Well done! Hope life continues to treat you well. [end]
[start] You’ve been sober as long as I’ve been alive and that is truly an amazing accomplishment. Congrats and here’s to many more sober years!!! [end]
[start] That’s amazing. Congratulations. [end]
[start] Congratulations! That’s a huge accomplishment. Thank you for sharing your victory with us. It’s so exciting to hear such a great success. [end]
[start] Well done! Proud of you, OP! [end]
[start] Well today is my day one.  Congratulations to your long time sobriety.  It is nice to see people who have made it up that hill. [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] Love this 💕 Way. To. GO! [end]
[start] Congratulations! I was sober for three years and am in the middle of a relapse. Thank you for giving me the inspiration to try again. [end]
[start] Congrats family! AA is great at times but full of "interesting" people, politics, and funerals. You can always find a new program. Otherwise you can do that dry drunk combo of reading your book and just not attending. My dad had a seven yr dry drunk streak then another 7yrs in program before liver cancer got him. I had 4yrs but honestly I'm drunk right now at 9am and should probably go back to the rooms. [end]
[start] Congratulations! You should celebrate this moment!   We all know ppl that didn’t or couldn’t make it. You took the time, put in the work and made a new life for yourself.   I’ve got 7 yrs... I still live day to day(especially in this crazy new world, lol)  I hope you have a great day. Filled with friends, laughter & light! [end]
[start] 8 months and 12 days today, told myself the same thing - I’d give it a year. It’s been a totally fucked up year so far but still hanging in there I guess. Not really doing so great, so it’s kind of encouraging seeing people who have made it as long as you. I don’t really do AA either, but this is the longest sober streak I’ve ever managed, so I guess it’s working so far. Hopefully things get better. Idk. We’ll see.   Congrats on 25 years. [end]
[start] Congrats! I know it's hard, but you did it and I'm sure your life is better. [end]
[start] Congratulations!!! [end]
[start] Amazing job! I’m proud of you! [end]
[start] Congrats!!! That’s amazing! I’m sure everyone agrees that all of us on reddit are proud of you! (: [end]
[start] You SHOULD celebrate - what an achievement!!  Congratulations!!! [end]
[start] Massive.  Well done mate. [end]
[start] Good on ya pal. I'm at just about 6 years myself. 25 is a much bigger number than 6 so you win. [end]
[start] My dad quit drinkin 30 years ago. His quit date was my b day jan 2. He used to drink 18 beer within a couple hours by himself. Whiskey was his fav. Good on you man. Its not easy staying sober esp. With family who use alcohol around you. Congratulations [end]
[start] Good job. Much of my family is sober and I’m very thankful for it. [end]
[start] In my first year I was at a meeting.  I heard this old timer (over 25yrs sober) .  He said "when newcomers ask me how I do it I say..don't drink and don't die"  It really is a simple program.  My Last drink 1/15/1992. [end]
[start] well as someone who just spent the night with a loved one completely out of their mind because of drugs, I am so very proud of you. [end]
[start] Proud of you. I'm almost 8 months free from alcohol. Thanks for the post. [end]
[start] strong willpower, congrats man [end]
[start] Awesome congratulations [end]
[start] Congrats !  Speaking from someone who’s always struggled w addiction, this makes me smile as well! [end]
[start] Congrats congrats congrats!!!!! Many virtual hugs!!! I am proud of you!!!! [end]
[start] You my friend are a champion of life. Congratulations [end]
[start] Happy birthday [end]
[start] Good job, buddy. [end]
[start] I’m so proud of you, keep the good work going my friend, and never stop dreaming of what your future holds for you [end]
[start] That's so awesome! Congrats! [end]
[start] Yayyyy!!! [end]
[start] Congratulations!! I'm so proud of you for maintaining your sobriety! One of the best decisions you've made, I'm sure! Congrats! Congrats! Congrats! [end]
[start] Indeed you should 😊 Enjoy [end]
[start] A Big congratulations to you. [end]
[start] This shit is awesome ! [end]
[start] Wow! An incredible accomplishment! Congratulations, and wishing you all the best. [end]

[start] Congrats!!! I hope to reach 25 years sober. I’m proud of you! [end]
[start] Congratulations!! [end]
[start] Hell yeah man, I'm proud of you! [end]
[start] Congrats my friend! That's a huge achievement.      My grandmother recently celebrated her 42nd anniversary . I'm proud to see people such as yourselves who have found the willpower and strength to conquer your struggles. [end]
[start] I admire you so much man.. congratulations. I’m still working on day 1. [end]
[start] Congratulations. That is awesome. Growing up in an addictive family members. I know too well that accomplishment and how hard it it. Stay strong [end]
[start] Congratulations buddy ! [end]
[start] Congratulations!!! [end]
[start] That’s awesome!! I’m proud of you and anyone who can stay sober. Way to go!! [end]
[start] Unfair disadvantage of acting appropriately as no one can really use to appear superior! lol, seriously though that's amazing news, congrats! [end]
[start] Let's go! I don't know anything about AA, but I bet it may be special for you and the group of you give a 25 year update at a meeting. I may watch too many movies but that seems like it would be nice [end]
[start] Wow 25 is impressive. Day at a time. In 8 days I’m hitting 2 years. Way to go [end]
[start] You've done an amazing job well done! I'm proud of you random stranger!! [end]
[start] Congratulations! You are inspiring! [end]
[start] That’s fucking amazing! So proud of you! I’m glad shit got better and I hope you continue to see improvements in all areas of your life. [end]
[start] You are awesome! That's a tough road and you owned it. [end]
[start] Congratulations. One day at a time and keep it real..! [end]
[start] it is worth it [end]
[start] Cheers ! [end]
[start] Hey man, congratulations.  I’m drunk as fuck, and i’ve been thinking about AA. [end]
[start] Amazing! You have every right to celebrate. Congratulations 🎉 [end]
[start] I have 2.5 years now. 25 years is amazing!! Congratulations! [end]
[start] r/stopdrinking [end]
[start] Congratulations man, right on. Not sure how you put up with AA though. It eww as way to cultish and religious based for my liking [end]
[start] So proud of your achievement. Your dedication is extremely inspiring. [end]
[TITLE] I resent my now ex for making me have surgery to remove cancer to save my life [TITLE]
[start] I am a woman who was married twice before and widowed twice. Normal sex life both times. In time I met another man who had had a radical prostectomy. Erections are difficult if nigh on impossible at times. I knew it going into the relationship and 10 years later I know and accept and willingly live with it. I am attractive and still have a good sex drive. We have some amazing sex. Not as often or maybe as conventionally but I am satisfied and still love him. Do not give up. He had until I came along. We are married going on 6;years. It is very possible to meet someone that will love and accept you as you are now. I can't possibly know as a woman how you feel exactly but I know what my husband goes through. Life brings us all kinds of crap. But we can use that crap and turn it into fertilizer that will grow a beautiful flower. Don't give up on having that beautiful flower again.  I wish you the best of luck sincerely and a big hug. [end]
[start] I'm sorry this happened to you. Are you in therapy?   Is there any chance of reconstruction surgery? [end]
[start] Dude that fucking sucks I'm so sorry. That must really suck and I cant imagine I could remotely relate. But tbh sex ain't everything and you could still live a life that is worth it. It might suck but atleast your around to do something about it.  Bring awareness for the cancer. Start a charity. Make something happen if anything out if pure spite for the partner who fucked you over. [end]
[start] I remember your post from a few months back and I'm really sad to hear how things turned out in the end. Can't even imagine how you're feeling right now. All I can say is that there really are women who couldn't care less about what is or isn't in your pants (me being one of them) and I'm sure you can still find your happiness with someone else. Especially since you sounded like a really good lover in your post. The most important thing is that you are alive. You can still be happy despite everything you've been through. And I know it doesn't mean much but this stranger on the Internet is genuinely happy that you are alive. [end]
[start] I don't think anyone could fault you for your feelings of resentment. [end]
[start] Yes.. it's horrible that you had to go through this. I sort of feel your struggle with your identity and self-worth because, as someone's who's a trans guy, it really sucks not having a dick. And I'm scared of all the things that could go wrong in my surgeries to come. I'm worried that no one would ever want to get with me because of what I am, and I feel so strongly for you since your relationship didn't work out, especially after she was the one who convinced you to do it in the first place. Just know you're not alone out there, okay? I know, or I have to know, somewhere along the line, someone will be willing to work with me.. so I know someone will be willing to work with you. I hope you have luck finding that someone in the future, or at least some kind of happy. You deserve to be here and be happy, even though it sucks, and it's hard, and you don't feel fully you. [end]
[start] As a trans person, it's REALLY hard to describe gender dysphoria to most cis folks because they just don't have a frame of reference for what it feels like for your body to just be...wrong. It's a pain many trans people will say (myself included) that we don't wish on even our worst enemy.  Unfortunately, you're right in the thick of it now. You're having identity issues, a part of you is missing that's central to how you view yourself, and you'd have rather died whole than lose that piece. It sucks. It sucks so much.    If you want an actionable item, maybe check out some of the surgeries FTM dudes have available to them. I can't really speak to them, since I'm on the other side of the aisle, but you might be able to find something that can help you feel whole again.   I hope you find your peace. [end]
[start] Bro look how far medicine has come in the last 30 years, they will definitely be able to give you some new junk in a few years https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/articles/first-ever-penis-and-scrotum-transplant-makes-history-at-johns-hopkins [end]
[start] Are you sure it was the lack of penis/sexual fulfillment that lead her to leaving? I don't mean to sound rude, but it sounds like this experience really changed you (for good reason, it's a big deal), and perhaps that lead to her leaving. I feel like the best thing you can do right now is not assume malicious intent. It's still not great that she left so quickly when the relationship faced struggles, though.   Like others have said, therapy is the best option. You've gone through a traumatic experience in life, and obviously need new tools mentally to overcome this challenge. [end]
[start] I can't imagine your pain, but I can say I've let people make medical decisions for me that ruined my life. Your story, though painful, holds power.   You can turn it around to advocate for others. I know the embarrassment of admitting to such medical issues, nevermind broadcasting them, but you can find victory in sharing your story and standing up for yourself and anyone else going through something similar. You can let the world know of your pain and stop other people from doing the same.   Overall, sex is not everything. If you decide for yourself to get castrated, that is your decision alone. You can still have a meaningful relationship either without sex or with a new normal working around your situation. It is not the end of anything but a relationship that hurt you. You've got this. Stay strong. [end]
[start] As painful as it may be, I suggest not castrating or doing anything else. Science is getting really good. There are surgeries that reconstruct the penis. I only know about Phalloplasty, which is primarily a transgender surgery, but I’m sure there are other surgeries aimed towards cis men. [end]
[start] Hey man, I want to offer my condolences but also a glimmer of hope. Medical advances are happening all the time, last year a guy got a full penis transplant.  Apparently Wake Forest is working on lab-grown dicks, https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/laboratory-grown-penises-ready-be-tested-humans/  May be a ways off, but it seems like it could very well be a reality within the next decade.  I would contact Wake Forest and inquire about clinical trials. Good luck to you  http://www.a-s-r-t.com/VCA/Genitourinary/WakeForestBaptistHealth.html    https://school.wakehealth.edu/Research/Institutes-and-Centers/Wake-Forest-Institute-for-Regenerative-Medicine [end]
[start] I also remember your post about this before and i think i commented then. I remember how adamant your then fiancee was about you having the surgery. I am so sorry this has happened, you have every right to feel angry and betrayed and disappointed. She gets to go on with her normal life and you’re left with the consequences of her decision. Also, how awful for your mum to spread your private news around, jesus!! I’m a woman so obv have no actual idea what youre going through but I just want to say please don’t consider your life not worth living. If you end it, it just eliminates any chance it will get better. You are so young and you WILL find a new normal again. Please continue to vent here whenever you want and engage in therapy as much as possible [end]
[start] I’m sorry what you’re going through. It sounds like a really shitty situation. Have you looked into any support groups for people who have had similar medical problems/ procedures?   I’m sorry you’re feeling so frustrated, and that your mom didn’t respect your privacy. I had some slightly more minor medical issues and my mother also told everyone (family, friends, her coworkers) without my consent. When I came in to town to visit I was bombarded with uncomfortable questions. It sucks. It’s a boundary that was crossed and stomped all over on. Basically, what I’m trying to say is that while my problems were different, I can sort of relate and empathize. The best thing to do moving forward is to only confide in a therapist, medical professional, or someone you can really trust.   As far as your ex, that sucks. But I don’t think she was malicious in wanting you to live. People don’t always know how they will truly feel in such a difficult situation. I’m sorry she left. Hopefully this will provide room in your life for someone who is meant for you, who will love you and cherish you. [end]
[start] What an irony. I have a penis but I don't use it. I mean My life wouldn't really change if I lost it. I would give you my dick if it could be possible. [end]
[start] You make perfect sense. I don't know what else to say. It might seem that death was preferable, but you can still have good food, drink. Go on adventures and stuff. Maybe you can spend what time you have left on that? Damn that woman anyway, if she loved you for your penis. And most of them don't really matter anyway, do they? [end]
[start] >and has to sit down and pee  Not sure if it wll make you feel better, but I always sit down when I pee.   No, but seriously I feel your hurt, and you have the right to be angry, but you must understand that a penis doesn't define you. I know that it's hard to accept, when you're actually in that situation, but I urge you to surrender to this fact.   In all honesty I think that it was quite a dick (no pun intended) move of her to leave you, but at the end  of the day it says a lot about what kind of person she is and how much she actually cares for you, and I don't know about you but I wouldn't want to be with someone who doesn't have the same feelings or same willingness to carry on a relationship.   Another thing is that it's alright to be unhappy, it's often assumed that you should be happy all the time and that if you're not happy your life is a failure. Well, I don't see it that way, I often feel unhappy, but also happy. You have been though a lot and I'm sure you have a lot to be proud of in your life, surviving cancer is one of them. So my advice to you would be to not fight your emotions, feel them, live them and learn from it, emotions tell us a lot about ourselves and if you are unhappy there is a reason for it, so you should not avoid happiness, instead experience it and grow from it, also focus on what you can control, not on what you can't.   All the best to you!  (I hope all this made sense, I'm not good at this, but I felt compelled to write, and sorry if I have been inconsiderate or have upset you in any way) [end]
[start] Just a stranger on the internet, but massive hugs to you.. [end]
[start] Your situation sounds tough. To be quite honest, your ex girlfriend breaking up with you over the fact that you no longer have a body part due to cancer is fucked up. My response is, that girl didn't truly love you. You were even willing to change the method of intercourse so she could be satisfied. The fact she wasn't willing to make a small sacrifice and the idea that it even needs to be seen as a sacrifice just shows how shitty of a character she was. Your self worth isn't based on your physicality. I think first you gotta learn to understand that for yourself. Easier said than done, as I and many others struggle with that too but that's one of the steps you need to take.   Maybe some peace of mind can be attained by the idea that everything happens for a reason. somehow your still alive. You contracted a very very rare cancer and somehow you made it through the process.   I don't know you, but i am happy that you're alive. I hope I didn't sound too cliche. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Bro I'm sorry to hear that. It sucks you put your trust in her and surprise surprise it didn't work out. That's not your fault, I'm sure you tried everything. She didn't hold up her end of the bargain. I've since stopped going after women altogether. Tired of the nonstop letdowns. Now, I just do me (lol, as in like just do whatever i wanna do, be myself), and I've never been happier.  No more "AsKiNg" to go do shit. No more waiting to make plans with friends, no more wasting a night, or a weekend doing shit I really have zero interest in doing.  Now I can do whatever I want to do. Whenever I want to do it, and go visit my friends whenever I see fit. Fly to Vegas and play poker all weekend? I make that decision. Eat pizza 2 nights in a row? DON'T MIND IF I DO!  Go Your Own Way my friend. :)  I wish you peace and happiness my man! [end]
[start] Why cant people just accept that some people are fine with death without being suicidal. You lost a big part of yourself. Not just in terms of penis, but in a lot of different ways. You saw it coming, but wasn't respected. [end]
[start] Mild suggestion that may or may not help, but I hope it does...  Skydiving.   Yes you read that right, you need to be reminded that you are alive. And quite frankly if those around you try to antagonize you, you’ll know you got bigger balls then them already (sorry) cuz you can jump out of a plane.   This worked for me as I was randomly invited to my ex’s birthday party, she just did this to try and get me jealous, but I said screw it I’ll go for a bit and meet someone worthy after. Well I get to the hotel room and there’s all these guys there from the navy, thinking they’re all tough n big. It almost felt as if it was battlegrounds for trying to win her over like who’s the most alpha guy here. They kept saying since I wasn’t in the navy (only one who wasn’t military) I didn’t experience anything “scary” as the gas chambers they kept talking about and I shouldn’t talk to them until I had the balls to do so.   I took a shot of makers, and asked them if they think they got what it takes to keep up. Everyone in the room looked at me as I said it to the one guy who thought he was atop of us all. He said he can do anything I can. Hahahahahaha little did he know I drove here, so I went to my trunk and grabbed my rig. Took a few of em atop the building (fire exit) and asked him the same question. He still didn’t know what I was about to do. So I said “wait right here, we’ll put your manliness to the test”. I went behind a AC unit and readyd up. Walk on over as I put on my helmet and they started to laugh thinkin “what’re you gonna go ride a bike?” I said no I’m about to jump into death and escape. I gave my ex a kiss on the cheek and began to BASE jump off the hotel. I turned and said in bold half drunk statements “they say the definition of hell is that upon your last day on earth, you’ll meet the man you could have become”. Smirked and nodded my head, jumped off into the abyss of clouds, and landed in ********* park.   I shat myself for a moment (hypothetically that is) because I landed rough AND next to a cop on a bike. I didn’t bother to try and bullshit my way around the bush but I was straight up to her. Soon after there were numerous other cops, and long story short she ended up arresting me and driving me back to the station for processing (where did she get a car that easy? I thought you only had a bike?) as we were driving I told her some of my wisdom and why I did it. She stopped abruptly by the train station. Gave me a card, and as clear as day I heard “I’ve never met someone who peaked my interest and dazzled my curiosity like you have, I get off my shift in a few hours, you’re going to call me and we’re going to meet up for some drinks, and you better do so”. Low and behold gents... I met someone worthy of my life.   Keep your head up my man, feel free to DM me if you need to. [end]
[start] Dude, it's just a dick. She saved your LIFE. I don't want to undermine any of your experiences and struggles--they sound horrendous, and I cant begin to imagine.   But, she doesn't "owe" you happiness. This is not her fault. Your perspective here seems warped, and maybe her lack of happiness comes from a relationship where the "who" has changed, not the "what."  She didn't "make" you live, you chose to live with her encouragement.   I totally see what shifts may occur when your physiology and sexual identity changes, but that means you need to change how you identify yourself. She cannot do that for you.   You are worth a lot. Your life is worth a lot. [end]
[start] Hell yeah that makes sense! Have you considered counseling? It could help resolve the resentment, if you’re ready to do that. [end]
[start] Damn dude I've been following your posts since you started. You have every right to be angry. Any sane human would be. My heart goes out to you man. Sometimes the universe changes our lives in unexpected ways but you are handling this shit like a champ. Any chance of getting a penis transplant from a donor? [end]
[start] I'm sorry I don't have advice, but I hope you can forgive my curiosity as someone who is doing almost everything he can to avoid cancer in his lifetime.  What are the potential causes that can lead to cancer like what you had? [end]
[start] If you're willing and open to therapy, I highly recommend it.  This is a whole different level of existential-type crisis + long term relationship breakup...  Doesn't even matter how mentally strong you may be, that is a tough journey to go through alone.    Hope you find some peace eventually. [end]
[start] There are so many woman out there who are low libido and would date you. Not every woman out there is sex crazy — I promise you! You will find your *true* soul mate. [end]
[start] Have you tried erm, erotic hynosis? Someone who will talk to you and hypnotize you into orgasm? That may be an option to use your imagination. Although, I don’t know how helpful this will be.      Otherwise I would say, look specifically for partners who are into what will get you off. I am sure they exist, there’s people who are into all shades of things. I’m thinking like specifically fetishy communities might be able to help you sexually at least. That’s the advice I have for you!      I’m so sorry you are going through this... don’t let it break your spirit... you can get through this! [end]
[start] Completely get it. There are  no words I can say to convey how sorry! [end]
[start] Maybe Energy orgasm will work on u? IDK about em just heard of em [end]
[start] I'd be trying to find men who've suffered similar loss and learn from & share with them. Good luck [end]
[start] Find an ace. I honestly I'm more unhappy with the fact my SO wants sex and has a penis and won't let me go. [end]
[start] If they can make a woman a man, whats stopping them from giving you a new dick? Man up, walk in with cash, and demand a new penis! Start a go fund me!!! [end]
[start] Hello there. I'm really sorry to hear about your story.   I was checking your posts and I just want to tell you something: remember how you wrote that you never thought you'd be able to have a sex life ever again but you found a way? You wrote that you had some great orgams, you were willing to try some new stuff... Focus on that!   You have every right to be angry and I can't even begin to imagine what you are going through, but you are alive! I know you resent your ex, but maybe you just really dodged a bullet. Or maybe this whole experience changed you so much you had to go separate ways. I'm sure you will find someone. As a girl with a high libido, I too would be crushed if I couldn't have traditional sex ever again. But you did manage! You were so confident in your previous posts. I'm sure you will be able to work on it and have a lot of great sex soon. And just like a lot of people are mentioning, therapy might help you a lot, so give it a chance. You will be able to talk with someone qualified to help you.  There will come a day you will be so happy you're alive, you will feel thankful for the encouragement of your ex girlfriend regarding the surgery. I think that ultimately she just wanted you to live. [end]
[start] That's awful, man. I think I would feel the same way, to die a man rather than be lied to by someone I thought I loved. Maybe she was trying not to hurt your feelings or was trying to make you feel okay but it still isn't right to mislead someone in such a huge way that will basically ruin their life.  A lot of women are heavily invested in the penis and that's just the way it is, some of them like to pretend that they're okay without one or with a small one but they're liars, either lying to themselves to feel like a good person or to their partner in some deluded attempt to make them feel better but not understanding their needs or feelings at all. If you're a straight woman, you like penises and of an average or better size. End of story. I wish people were more honest and straight-forward about it.  What happened to you is a tragedy and you have my sincerest condolences. I can only hope that you manage to find a way to get some kind of life that you can enjoy. [end]
[start] That is your origin story now let's see what kind of person you become , Be a Super hero [end]
[start] That all sounds so extremely difficult. I sometimes ponder what I would do in a situation like that. I'm sure a lot of guys ponder this as it's a real thing that happens. Your ex likely desperately wanted to keep you alive because she cared so much for you and wouldn't have been able to live with the guilt of knowing she didn't do everything she could to keep you alive. Sounds like she did everything she could to keep you alive even if it meant a whole lot of heart break and frustration.  Now the most difficult thing is to make the best of  the situation. Theres tons of experimental tissue going on right now its 2019, do some research to learn what kind of operations there are. I remember hearing about this guy who had his finger removed and other tissues to form a new penis. There's probably better options now. Meanwhile contemplate giving to people in non sexual ways like working in charity organizations or places that you will feel good. You can still connect with humanity.     Maybe dissown the people who went around telling everybody about your personal business and start a new life as champion of good will waiting for his cyborg penis operation and a woman who wants to spend the rest of her life with you. Looking forward life isn't  complete until you've lived all of it and we all leave parts of our lives behind us [end]
[start] What an utterly horrible thing for your partner to do to you. Obviously you can’t force her to stay and people are entitled to leave situations they’re no longer happy in but what the fuck. Do people not understand what commitment is? It means toughing it out when it’s hard and things aren’t going how you planned. It means standing by your partner when they’re going through a difficult time and not bailing on them. I’m sick for you.  I hope you find happiness and fulfillment in spite of it all. Good luck to you. [end]
[start] Damn, bro. I don't want to preach advice because this is way above my pay grade and I'm totally going to go home tonight and just cherish my dick after reading your story. One thing I will say is how I'm a little envious that you'll definitely have to learn that not everything is about sex. I personally hate it when people tell me that because good sex is like a complete validation of a relationship, you know? But those thoughts come from a place where baser instincts rule. There has to be something deeper, right? I hope you find that, dude. [end]
[start] I’m happy you are alive and there are many of us who don’t date people for their genitals. I fall in love with the person. You are more than a penis. You will find someone. I’m so sorry you’re going through this! [end]
[start] That sucks. But surely you're more than your peepee? I mean you still have testosterone. You can still have kids, by producing sperm, right?  Being a man is much more than just having a penis. [end]
[start] Wow. I’m so sorry you had to go through all that. How you feel makes perfect sense. She made you go through all that against your own wishes just to leave? It’s stuff like this where I wish I believed in heaven and hell. [end]
[start] I'm sorry about your situation and it must be hard especially after she promised you she would stay when you got surgery. But people are right, you will find someone out there that will love you with or without a penis....  "There are more fish in the sea" [end]
[start] You're going to fall in love with another girl someday and you'll be so happy that you were alive for it! [end]
[start] Have you ever been to hospice? That's something to think about. [end]
[start] It completely makes sense for you to feel this way. As it sounds like she saved your life only to break your heart. I’m deeply sorry that it didn’t work out but am happy that you are alive. I mean I get it, I would never be one to force someone to live out an existence they thought was miserable but I do think that you can find someone who will see you as whole even if you don’t. I think therapy and finding something to redirect your energies may help. Like volunteering or maybe even just starting a group for others like you. There is hope and I hope you find it. [end]
[start] Fuck that's rough man. I hope you are able to find happiness and satisfaction I really do. [end]
[start] i don't know what its like to lose my dick but i understand that hopeless lonely feeling. but for me, i think there has to be more to life than romance. sometimes i look to all the great men in history who had rich and full lives without any romance. some of them were comfortable with a dead bedroom, others struggled through it. but they all managed to live interesting lives and achieve great things.  -  i think it starts with a shift in goals and perspective. that takes a lot of work but it can be done. [end]
[start] If sex is such a big thing to you then Id recommend doing some kind of treatment to stop it. I can only imagine how frustrated and angry you must feel, but the guy from the top comment is right. I enjoy sex but I do not mind the lack of it. Other things make me happy and fill the void. Youre obviously different, but I bet that if you valued or cared for sex as much as I do, youd find other things to focus on and a new meaning for your life. So if theres any type of treatment that can do that then Id say do it. [end]
[start] This might sound out of left field but look into psychadellic-assisted psychotherapy. Check out the book How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan.  Basically there's a bunch of new interesting research that shows that a guided trip can drastically improve the outlook and life satisfaction, even for terminally ill cancer patients. I know that's not the situation you're in right now, but either way, it sounds like a profound experience that gets you out of the story you've told yourself about your life that allows you some distance and perspective and the ability to recalibrate could be incredibly beneficial to you. Good luck. [end]
[start] Oh my god. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I don’t blame you for resenting her, you did this for her. Fuck! I’m speechless, there really is some shitty assholes on this earth.  I wish you well & that happiness finds its way to you. You’re a warrior my friend! [end]
[start] Have you looked into prostate orgasms for relief? [end]
[start] Yo. So I read this and I've been thinking. This has been an extreme change for you.   In some of your other comments you said sex is a massive thing for you.   Maybe do research about what you can replace sex with, like working out, running, all of that jazz. Maybe it will open a new avenue of hobbies.   I understand it's a tough time but you'll get thought it m8. [end]
[start] Okay, hold on... Is the entire 'shaft' gone? or is it just the testicles and you can't get an erection? (this matters)  &#x200B;  I can feel your anger, I get it. But, it did save your life, and maybe you had things to repent for, so you can't be too mad at her, though I get where you're coming from. (My advice, get a strap-on, and simulate it, there are men with penis's that lock them up (in chastity belts), and don't even use them and have very fulfilling sex lives. Look into those alternatives.) [end]
[start] > I resent her so much for saving my life - does that make sense?  Makes *total* sense.  This life sucks. [end]
[start] That really sucks and your ex is entirely in the wrong in this situation [end]
[start] I didn't even know this existed until now. And I thought testicular cancer was bad. Holy fuck. [end]
[start] Bro i am sorry.. That must fucking suck. Have you researched penis transplant? IK in south africa a while back a dude got one after a botched cultural circumcision.     Research that before you do anything rash. Its south africa so it probably wont cost 1/10th it would eslewhere. The dude went out & got a child too after a while. [end]
[start] It makes complete sense. She lied to you and betrayed you. You may be depressed right now, but life is a gift. Perhaps you can take this gift and make it something beautiful. She obviously was not your sole mate since she left. That leaves room for your true soul mate. I look forward to hearing a good report of you finding a lasting love. Please focus on other things in life that are good- work, hobbies, travel, other relationships. Please do not keep bitterness in your heart against your mom or your ex. Bitterness only hurts you, and you have had enough hurts. [end]
[start] I wish I could say something that would help or give you advice or hope because most of it is bs. But love is out there, there are like 8 billion people on the planet, that’s so many people that can and will love you, romantically, sexually, platonically. I’m sorry about your situation and I really do wish the best for you [end]
[start] U dont need a penis to please a woman. Nuff said [end]
[start] Dude I think I might have a similar problem downstairs and haven't seen a doctor yet.Scared I guess.So I can say honestly I think I know how you feel.Im not going to tell anybody for the same reason.My family can't keep a secret even if it meant it would save the World.They got to have the drama in their life.They will disguise the urge to do so under the pretense that "They really needed to know"Such B.S.Anyway,hang in there buddy.Oops.Sorry about that.I was gonna erase that last statement but maybe you could use a chuckle.Any advise you can lend is appreciated.Thanks for the post. [end]
[start] If you want a happy ending, it depends on where you finish the story - Orsen Welles   I get exactly where you’re coming from because I have also gone through a crisis of identity regarding my masculinity etc, but due to the fact that I have hsdd. From your side of things I’m sure you’d think this a great deal (having lost my libido) but it’s as isolating a condition as your own and has been a difficult road.   Things are better to some degree as I learn how to value my new life, but I’m still depressed in an angedonia type way - which I think is tied to my lack of libido so I wouldn’t recommend actual castration - try chemical first and see how you go maybe...   Anyway, I get and fully appreciate the idea of you having been able to die. People ascribe far more fear to death than is warranted. There are worse states we can be in than dead, but they’re always mental. There was a study done on people wth locked in syndrome who were given a technological mechanism to communicate after all those years being apparent comatose but actually awake and trapped, and when asked if they would rather die try basically all said no. Life to them had gained value. I learn day by day that while I will never get rid of my misery and shitty state (or its very unlikely) there is value I can take from the world.   On a hopeful note for your condition, there is money going into penile replacement/reconstruction surgery research. This issue is common enough that it is receiving funding. Cancer, damage obtained in war, transsexual reassignment.  It is not inconceivable that in 10 years you may be able to get a new penis. It very likely won’t work like your old one, but research into enervation is undoubtedly having money thrown at it too. Medical advancement is always occurring. It is your job to get rich enough to seize that opportunity when it comes.   Total penile replacement will likely come about before a male hsdd cure. The closest my issue comes to being researched is post menopausal hsdd of women, which bares very little similarity in cause. Understanding of the brain is rudimentary by comparison to biomechanical issues.   So create a preposterous set of milestones that will get you to a new penis and move toward it. [end]
[start] I cant begin to imagine how hard things are for you right now. Losing one part of myself is something that I dont even think I can deal with, let alone if it was the penis.  But it’s not something worth dying for. Penetration is not everything in sex, many women cant even orgasm from it. You can have sex, you just have to take your time to adapt to it.  Hopefully, you will meet somebody that will be there for you in this process. [end]
[start] Sorry mate. If it helps in the slightest, a lot of German men sit to pee, because it is cleaner than standing and spraying everywhere. So you don’t need to feel less manly about that.  http://www.schnitzelbahn.com/homepage/2010/9/30/return-of-the-sitzpinkel-the-toilet-ghost.html [end]
[start] I just red your post history and I am feeling so bad for you. Last thing youre waiting for is obviously a pity comment but im a shitty person and just had to. My heart is with you on this one.  You are at the worst point of life it feels like I can imagine. But youre 35 and so willing and trying as your posts tell me. You deserve someone and can make somebody so fucking happy so please dont let this get all of you. It will take a lot, but please take whats left to rebuild. Take you-time, travel, discover a new hobby, keep talking(!). Step out of your own bubble youre living in. Sometimes things need to fall apart in order for new things to come together.  You are awesome!! [end]
[start] Well, that absolutely blows. The good news is: it’s 2019. I’m sure you’ve already looked into getting one surgically implanted and I mean if girls can have penises that way then I’m sure you could? Obviously not the same but it could help?   In regards to your ex, I hope she stubs her toe on her coffee table every morning for the rest of her life. That’s some bull. You have every right to resent her. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry to hear this. Have you tried reaching out to r/FtM? It’s a sub full of guys who were born without penises (like myself). We’ve come up with a lot of ways of coping (and thriving!) with the dysphoria that comes with having a body that doesn’t match what it should be. You’ll find a really supportive community there. [end]
[start] I can only imagine the impact this has had on your world. Not just ripping the rug out from under you, but throwing you into an entirely different dimension, even probably that doesn't come close to describing it. I'm not in any way trying to dismiss or minimise what's happened in saying, You can't change what has happened. And focusing on all the negatives, as much as they need to be validated and processed, don't let them drag you down a dark path. You are obviously a great bloke. I can hear it in your honest vulnerability and your responses. You are a great benefit to this world. This is a huge thing of unexplainable magnitude that you're trying to walk with. Just be so proud of all that you are in spite of what you have been through. This is now going to be a journey of the self. You're going to have to focus on fine tuning and deeply connecting with all your emotions. It's not going to replace sex and that's not what you're trying to do. It's just going to ground you in s deeper and more secure sense of self. And it's the only advice or condolences I can offer. I had no sense of self. I was raised in abuse and ran away from that straight into a severely abusive relationship, that I don't know how I survived. The worst thing about all of that was the hollow feeling. I was an empty shell and I was taught to hate everything about myself, everything about myself was wrong and disgusting, repulsive. This was the internal dialogue my abusers left echoing in my head. I couldn't believe anything good about myself, unless someone else said it. And the best thing I have ever done is heal myself of that (as much as is possible) I just started treating myself as important, I reconnected with my emotions, sat with them, listened to them, validated them. I know, I sound like a total kook. But I now have a solid sense of self, and it's like a loyal best friend, helps me cope with so much. You spend the most time on this earth with yourself as company. Even if you're in a committed relationship. It's still the you show, inside your head. Why not live the happiest live you can with what you have available to you. It's a journey. A long quest. You're in the hardest part right now. If sex isn't going to be big on the script right now, why not play some other tunes till they sing, rock the place down. Sex can come back, later, never give up on modern medicine. Make this your best life. MacGyver hack your life. Just start small. Find all the things, any little things that bring you happiness. Small pleasures. Coffee at sunrise. Hell, just coffee. Sand between your toes. A good book. Walking in nature. Find the best beer, the literal best. Taste them all. Slowly they all add up to every moment spent in happiness. Your focus is happiness, what you focus intently on, becomes all you see. It's not going to fix the problem, but all anyone can really do is try and live their best life. Make this your best life, be invincible. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Are there sex therapist in the UK? If so make an appointment ASAP, they may have good advise and techniques for you. I'm so sorry you are suffering with this problem but please don't blame your ex. She saved your life. As for the break up, it may have happened anyway regardless of the health problem. Wishing you all the best and give your canine friend a hug from me. [end]
[start] Mind if I chime in again.I think you should make amends with your mom.Not to condone what she did,but mom's are mom's and healing begins with forgiveness.You might need her on your road to recovery.I don't know anything about her but I thought about life without my mom and wondered if you needed to hear this.I still doubt that I will say anything to my mom if my test results come in contrary to my wishes but again shes Mom and I love her. [end]
[start] I'm so sorry, that's horrible. May peace come to you. [end]
[start] What the fuck  I can't add any insight. All I can say is it's horrible you've had to experience that and had to experience losing her [end]
[start] Damn bro id rather kill my self [end]
[start] I’m sorry for what happened dude, can’t you get a cosmetic one? Perhaps in the future they’d  probably be able to grow organs, so don’t lose hope :) [end]
[start] Christ. I'm so sorry :( I can't even imagine what you're going through. I'd resent her too. I think that was a shitty card for her to pull. Sometimes people make mistakes.   But you're alive. You're alive so keep on living. What you went through is traumatic as all hell, but try your best not to let it stop you from finding other passions and enjoying your life. [end]
[start] Listen, I cant say I know how it feels regarding losing your man-parts but one thing I can tell you is she would have left you with or without the penis. Thats how some women are. You might think removing your penis contributed to the break up, maybe it did, but i doubt it was the full reason. All I can tell you is the saying "I cant live without you" is a lie. Her saying that to you or you saying that to her. You were alive before her and youll live on after her. One day, when you find that special woman meant just for you, you will thank your Ex for pushing you to stay alive. Right now you feel down, And I feel you (broke up with my gf/fiance of 10 years), and feeling resentful is normal but you can either take it as something that would push you forward, or something that will tie you down till you hit the ground and cant get up. A penis isnt needed for a happy relationship or marriage, not now a days anyway. Plenty of women out there who dont even enjoy sex as much as foreplay or using toys. You got the whole world ahead of you and man trust me when i say this: focus on yourself, be the most successful version of yourself and it doesnt matter if you decide to put a wood shaped penis in place of your fallen soldier, youll get all and any women you desire. Success beats sex any day buddy. [end]
[start] Are you still wanting to have sex?  You said your sex drive is gone. I ask because there are asexual people out there. Many.  r/asexual. Os one on reddit. Check it out [end]
[start] People gonna do them. *shrug*. Sounds like she didnt want you to die, so she made a choice to keep you around. Balls in your court (oh God I'm so sorry)   You have infinitely more choices now than you had if you were to die. Dwelling on someone who doesnt want to be with you isnt going to help. You'll move on, even if the wound never totally heals. That's life.  Unfortunately sex is important for most folks so yeah... its gonna make things harder. Not much to say on that. People arent wrong for desiring it, and not wanting to be with someone who cannot. You just gotta find your niche I guess.  Maybe talk to your mom. Whatever she did she's still your mom and I'm sure she didnt mean to harm you. You only get one. [end]
[start] In this day and age there are few things that are truly no hope situations. It sounds like this doesn’t have to be one. Your life doesn’t have to be miserable - you were dealt a shitty hand and now you have to accommodate and it’s incredibly unfair but not impossible. Look into therapy and sex therapy, I’ve heard accounts from men who have lost their penises or their penises are essentially useless and other parts of the body can become incredibly sensitive as a natural accommodation. When you are comfortable, start to sexually explore and kind of re introduce your new way of sex into your life. Toys and different things like that. Also! There are tens of thousands of people who physically cannot have penetrative sex because of trauma or because it’s too painful for them. There are many people and women who are in a similar boat as you and more people cannot have conventional sex than you might think. I am so terrible sorry you have had to go through this. I can’t imagine how unfair it must feel. Just know no matter what - you are still a wonderful person with many many things to give. You are worthy of love and happiness and nothing, not even cancer, can take that away from you. If you ever need an ear I’m here for you! [end]
[start] I totally understand what you’re saying. My friend, I am so very sorry you’re going through this. Sometimes in life, we’re hit with incredibly strange curves to our life that we don’t even know where to go from here.... I promise you that you’ll get through this.  Sending you love and light ✨🙏🏼✨ [end]
[start] My dad had brain cancer when I was 6. Came to within a millimeter of his life. In fact, doctors were surprised he survived. But it left him permanently impotent. My mom left him (and me and my siblings 18m, 19f, and 20m at the time), when I was 9.  When I was 16, he made this statement to me when the conversation came up: no woman wants a man who can't 'f' them. I responded to say, in a nutshell, bullshit. Five years later he remarried, and they stayed together until he passed away. He told me he wouldn't have even tried with her if I hadn't said that.  I sincerely hope you can heal and learn to live and love again. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Another 1 out of 274859399393 reasons why I hate women.  Pieces of shit.  Hope things go well for you OP. [end]
[start] AWALT [end]
[start] Just thinking about how it must feel to not have a penis makes me shiver... I think I’d have taken the same chose you were going to take and die with my penis, I wish you luck in whatever you decide from here on, whether to live or to die. [end]
[start] Dude, I don't envy you, and it frankly pisses me off that all these women and normies down here are telling you it's YOUR fault, because you haven't maintained a positive attitude. I don't even know what else to say, I would've opted to be euthanized. Women are heartless. [end]
[start] It makes sense and I am so sorry. I am bisexual and know that I can be attracted to male, female, or even transgender. I do say that to let you know that there are people out there who will like you for you no matter what you’ve got between your legs. And they’ll still want to pleasure you and feel that closeness with you. And yes it is still possible. I don’t know your ex but I have irrational anger towards her for making you think and feel so low. I don’t want to get off on a tangent, but I just wanted to say that I know love is possible for you again, and feeling that closeness, is also possible with someone again. [end]
[start] What a rough story. Sorry to hear that OP.   About your mom. It's brutal that she told others. I know for sure I wouldn't want anyone knowing. I'm similar to you that way. But ultimately you can probably tell if she did it with bad or good intentions. It sounds like the intentions were good due to your relationship before hand. It's possible that what you were going through bothered her enough that she would be stressed. I know most good parents would be destroyed to know their kid wants to die before them. It's not an easy thing to carry around as a secret. Especially by a mom who's son might die. Heavy burden.   Don't hold that against her. Go hug your mom and accept her apology.   You are justified in feeling the way you do. I don't know about your ex but your mom might deserve your forgiveness.   If you ever find happiness again and I hope you do. Thank the people that saved you. [end]
[start] thats some fucking horseshit i am so sorry for you man, im not telling you to do anything or nothing, but if that happened to me, id kill myself. youre strong. [end]
[start] It's ok op, I hate your ex too. To push you into a surgery you didn't want by threatening to leave you, but still leaves you in the end. She's the worst. [end]
[start] Yikes, that fucking sucks man.  Even more that you’ve experienced it.  Just a shitty situation all around.    Date someone with severe vaginismus.  They’re looking for someone they can just be with because they’re incapable of having intercourse themselves. [end]
[start] I mean , if women can get a penis nowdays why don't you get yours reconstructed? [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] So wait.....you’ve still got the balls? [end]
[start] First of:castration wil NOT help.  If you didn’t already learn from your mom, you should have cut contact with everyone but a lawyer, doctor, and MAYBE a male psychologist. All men. You letting her influence you was a mistake. Nonetheless, you are alive. It is stupid to be brave/proud like that. Dis you freeze sperm? You have to deal with the fact that feom now on, you have to rely on paid sex workers, many of whom may initially reject you. Even if your wife stays with her kind of human slave. You also have the stories going around i. Askresdit of necrotic tissue in penis that had to be removed. [end]
[start] This is going to sound mean and I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell but...  What is it with men and having their whole lives connected to their dicks??? Why do they care about their masculinity so much? A woman can get breast or vaginal cancer and get them removed and move on with their life no problem. Why would you rather die then live without a dick?   Hell, you need someone who won't care if you have a dick or not. (As a girl myself, I have no real care for sex, personally at least.) [end]

[start] Internet points here I come! [end]
[start] i’m trying to get karma too! [end]
[start] I’m so new (like literally ten minutes in)... that I have no idea what this karma is u speak of ... [end]
[start] r/freekarma4u is a great place to get enough karma to post or comment.  I'm a long time lurker with no karma but it helped me get enough to post [end]
[start] Oof. My other account recently got banned so now I’m trying to muster up karma with this account. I’m about 2 weeks old now with almost 1k karma.   I personally don’t believe that there’s anything wrong with commenting meaningless stuff to start the karma train. But there is a problem if you do it once you’ve passed 1k. I don’t really know where I was going with this anymore but anyway good luck in your karma farming. I gave your post and as many of your comments as I could see an upvote to help you out.   Once again, good luck on your journey. [end]
[start] Never comment either b/c it feels like I'm wasting time tbh and I also don't feel like I can add anything interesting to the conversation. [end]
[start] This is exactly how real life works. Say what you think and take whatever happens. The only difference here is you can visually see how much you're accepted.   At least here you don't "know" anyone. [end]
[start] How much karma does one generally need in order for it to not be taken down? [end]
[start] Yeah l have low karma too and l will try and up it up now [end]
[start] Sell 5% of your soul for karma, enjoy the benefits of freedom of expression as your soul heals [end]
[start] Liked & boosted ^^ [end]
[start] This is relatable. I used to comment more often but I oftentimes don’t get any responses or interaction with others so it discourages me and makes me comment less. I don’t know if anyone will see this but it’s just nice to get it off my chest.  Edit: thank you to whoever gave the Gold! Wow my first ever gold. Thank you! [end]
[start] i got luck my first post blew up [end]
[start] Lol [end]
[start] Karma, karma for you [end]
[start] Are you sure you weren't just downvoted? I mean, if Reddit is about anything, it's the power if the downvote. [end]
[start] Im new, what is karma? [end]
[start] Who cares either way. Someone is bound to agree and some are not bound to agree but is it really about that?  Or ensuring someone out their realizes they aren’t alone ! [end]
[start] Well, here's you're internet point. Thanks for letting me know you dislike me. [end]
[start] this is why i dont care for po9sting on reddit much. whole thing is really dumb and slightly toxic [end]
[start] Why not post a thoughtful comment that contributes something to the discussion, instead?  And try not to have a cynical attitude. [end]
[start] Here’s my vote.:)  Edit: what was your first comment after so long? If you don’t mind me asking.:) sorry for being curious. [end]
[start] im in the same boat [end]
[start] i need some points to baby!!! [end]
[start] Just go into a popular subreddit and sort by new or rising so you can comment early on one of the posts. That should get you some of that sweet karma. [end]
[start] Give me some karmaaaaa [end]
[start] Hello dear [end]
[start] Here. Take my Internet points. [end]
[start] Life is but a Play, and we all are but players on a stage [end]
[start] I’ll throw you a frickin bone here. [end]
[start] Same thing happened with me, but in the hindsight it is a way for people like ( who can be shy online too) to push them to write something or express their views. You can decide where you want to express your views.  Anyway may you get more karma ! Have fun ! :) [end]
[start] You gotta love reddit. [end]
[start] What’s your reasoning for not posting or commenting in the first place? I’m a curious cat. [end]
[start] Enjoy your karma, bro [end]
[start] I have been on Reddit for over a year and still haven't accumulated enough karma to post on a lot of the subreddits I follow. It's a bummer it's so difficult to earn karma. I'll like some of your stuff for you to help! [end]
[start] I'm still pretty new to reddit so these karma explanations have been insightful. I think I have like 15 karma. [end]
[start] Think of something worth saying then [end]
[start] Free internet points to you!!!! Hope this helps my man!! [end]
[start] It's not too hard to get those points, really I join discussions I'm interested in, and I add meaningful comments or ask thoughtful questions. [end]
[start] I can kinda relate but there are smaller subreddits where it feels more “right” to comment because of a more family-like community feeling. [end]
[start] Welcome to being a reddit contributor. 9/10 your post will be removed for some stupid reason unless you have tons of freetime to read and memorize all the rules of the subs you post on. [end]
[start]  Reddit apparently works pretty much like the rest of the world eh? I didn't know, I never read directions. [end]
[start] This [end]
[start] No one forces you to leave irrelevant comments or things that don't add any context. Surely there is *some* sort of subreddit you have an interest in, and would genuinely want to converse in? [end]
[start] Now they’re saying it’s karma. Your points were on the line [end]
[start] Don't you think there is a sort of logic to not being able to direct the conversation (post) of you've never made any effort to be a part of it (comment)? [end]
[start] Or! You are socializing! Yep you are gonna get downvoted but hey, in the real world not everyone will like you either! And when you find your place here, you’ll love it. Just look for the right subs!   But really! Socialize socialize if there was ever a time to socialize it’s now!   Socializinggggg [end]
[start] congrats on getting your cherry broke [end]
[start] Try to discuss in r/Amitheasshole thread.... Only mature opinion no satire there [end]
[start] I know the feel. I just want to post a pic of my cat [end]
[start] Protip: find a cat subreddit and post a picture of a cat. Instakarm with only minor cringe (from yourself). [end]
[start] Karmakarmakarmakarma! [end]
[start] I just created a new account, I feel lost :( [end]
[start] Wtf [end]
[start] Ok, boomer [end]
[start] >I have to become a person I dislike... a person who will post dumb and meaningless comment that doesn't add anything to the context just to get those 'sweet' internet points...  Imagine putting something like Reddit on a pedestal. Christ almighty. [end]
[start] That's hilarious!!!!  :D [end]
[start] haha funny [end]
[start] I have the opposite problem than you. [end]
[start] wtf [end]
[start] You used to judge those people for being absolute morons.  Idiots.  Fools.  And now you've become one of them yourself.  A real redditor.    There's a lesson in there for all of us. [end]
[start] Sucks [end]
[start] I always wondered why my posts don't show up. [end]
[start] I post relatable comments, therefore I am. [end]
[start] Yeah Reddit kinda sucks that way [end]
[start] > r/funny and types "haha funny"  F [end]
[start] On one hand I get what you're saying but on the other you're blowing it out of proportion, getting that little bit of karma is not difficult at all and does not require you to post generic karma whoring comments. [end]
[start] In years of being on reddit there is not one single thread that you could possibly find to add meaningful input? Like.. not even one? [end]
[start] but it’s funny [end]
[start] Aaaand now u have more karma than me, who has been commenting for a year or so [end]
[start] wtf [end]
[start] Some of my various comments seem to have disappeared. Why? [end]
[start] Yeah its stupid, it's like looking for a job when you've left school and all the vacancies say they need previous experience. [end]
[start] All fixed [end]
[TITLE] To the Popeyes employee at Las Vegas Blvd named Andrew that my parents shouted at, I am deeply so so sorry [TITLE]
[start] i love this, my parents are the same way. i’m glad u checked them lmao! [end]
[start] Call the store, it's more likely to get to him👍 [end]
[start] Dude this is really sweet to post this [end]
[start] So nice of you to post [end]
[start] Woah I live in Las Vegas [end]
[start] Alright Reddit, we need to find Andrew and get him to see this! [end]
[start] What did they say after you checked them? Did she realize she overreacted?  Does she understand she could have just been polite? [end]
[start] Sometimes the adults are more immature than the children. [end]
[start] You’re a good person. :) [end]
[start] I need to make a post apologizing to all the servers that my mom tipped 10 percent cuz “that was a good tip back in my day!” [end]
[start] Ayy that's my closest Popeyes. Crazy to see a post like this on my feed [end]
[start] People expect fast food employees to be infallible or something. Customers tend to think only about their order, which can range from simple to complex, but it doesn't matter, because those employees have to process hundreds of meals everyday. I implore any one of you to try it and not make a mistake. [end]
[start] r/insaneparents r/entitledparents [end]
[start] call the place!! [end]
[start] As someone who used to work at Popeyes, this is a really nice post. Mixing up mild and spicy is like the simplest and most common mistake there is, no one deserves to be yelled at for that. [end]
[start] Each individual is responsible for their own choices when deciding how to deal with other people. It's *not* your responsibility to clean up after your parents' indiscretions. Do not apologize for them.  Tell them how disappointed you are with them - would they want *you* to behave like that? Would *they* want to be treated like that over a simple misunderstanding on their part? Tell them respect is earned, and right now they've not earned yours.  ***They*** need to apologise, not you. [end]
[start] Andrew, you’re a real one. And so are you for posting this, I hope he sees it. I won’t go out to eat with my mom if she’s in a mood bc she can have a mean ass attitude to waitstaff (& I serve too, smh). [end]
[start] Man. I felt this one! My mom did this frequently in my young life. Drive-thru or sit down restaurants and it always gave me anxiety. I’m generally a mellow/chill person who hates confrontation, wonder why?...Just kidding, stuff like this is why. It takes no time or effort to just be kind. I always felt so bad for the person on the receiving end of her frustration. Mostly because people make mistakes everyday, everyone does. There is no reason to be rude and nasty over a mistake. It takes no time or effort to just be kind!  Good on you for telling them their behavior was unnecessary and rude. I’m sorry you have to put up with that. It sounds like you’re turning out just fine though! [end]
[start] I’m with you. I’ve tried to send many a mental apologies to the workers my dad has berated over the years growing up.  I’m sorry that your parents let you down like this. [end]
[start] i'm proud of you for telling them off. i never could tell my parents off. they never beat me, but they beat each other all the time. the threat of violence to me was always there. [end]
[start] My mom just did this about a sweet tea at McDonald’s. Asked for sweet, got unsweetened and acted like her world was ending. She kept smiling/laughing in “disbelief” as she was explaining the mix up to the employee and kept looking at me for reassurance while shaking her head.   It was embarrassing. No clue where her entitlement comes from in those situations. [end]
[start] Yo which Popeyes is this exactly?  I want to call there and tell him you said so. [end]
[start] Its really cool that you can see this. You’re a good person. Stay like this! [end]
[start] Honest question, but why would you ever say, "not spicy" instead of just saying "mild"? [end]
[start] Andrew is gonna be fine, I'm more concerned about why y'all picked mild over spicy. [end]
[start] Also, why would you ever order non-spicy? Andrew was doing them a favour. [end]
[start] Las Vegas Blvd and Windmill? [end]
[start] CALL THEMMMM [end]
[start] This is why I cannot go out with my parents. I always find myself apologizing for their entitled behavior-especially my mother’s. It’s so bad and embarrassing [end]
[start] Andrew sounds nice. Andy spicy is best popeyes. [end]
[start] start treating your parents like shit every time they make a minor mistake and shout at them like they do service people and ask if they like it. and actually say something in the moment next time. you could have said “andrew don’t let my parents bring you down, they’re miserable and entitled about chicken.” fuck your parents, they suck. [end]
[start] You could post this on r/entitledparents [end]
[start] Let them know you are disappointed because that could have been you working, and people make mistakes. [end]
[start] Hey if u live nearby go tell him this. Just a suggestion tho [end]
[start] Don't worry about it. [end]
[start] You're the true MVP kiddo. [end]
[start] My parents are like this too, I hate it when I see them treat with service workers like shit, and when I bring them up on it they act like I have some kind of problem. I think that they generally think being rude to a worker when you have an issue with a product or service will automatically get your problem resolved faster. [end]
[start] I understand. I feel the same when my mom does not thank the cashier. Cashiers work a thankless job for pittance, the least people can do is be kind and show a little respect. [end]
[start] i feel this! once i had to call best buy to apologize for my moms behavior lol [end]
[start] This! Ive felt like this with my dad my entire life.... Screaming at people over the phone of theyre customer service isnt perfect in his opinion or if HE deems them uneducated on their job... Like dude its hard for ppl to think straight when youre grilling them and giving them attitude?  Hes gotten better over the years but... I just resonated with this post. Youre a sweetie :) [end]
[start] Your parents need to check themselves. They’re eating at Popeyes and have the audacity to be demanding about service. If you’re paying more you can afford to be demanding. Maybe go to BK drive thru next time so they can get high off of their power from the paper crowns [end]
[start]  Awwww.  OP, you’re a good dude/dudette. [end]
[start] You should say something when you were there instead of making confession posts. [end]
[start] Hi it’s Andrew 👋🏽 I wanted to say it’s ok 🙂    (Ok I’m kidding sorry lol) [end]
[start] #ONE QUESTION  Since we are talking about being "entitled", WHO PAID FOR THE CHICKEN? [end]
[start] hi [end]
[start] My grandpa had most of his colon removed from shrapnel from the war. When he says "no spicy food", he means "no spicy food". Giving him spicy food is like giving a snowflake child a peanut. It's not a trivial matter. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[TITLE] I want to share something a friend posted that helps clarify what's going on in the US right now. The protests are not *just* about one isolated incident. This is about race. The issue goes far deeper than that and it can't be explained away that easily. [TITLE]
[start] Can you post references for stats and facts? [end]
[start] America has like the most militarized police in the world and the largest prison population. Even the racist and totalitarian Russian cops kill less people (mostly torture suspects to death during the detention, so victims will admit to crimes). Compared to America, actual African countries don't have huge budgets and a lot of police officers, yet still manage to have far less criminals. America is literally worse than the poor African countries when it comes to the society, competing only with Russia. The superpower is not super safe, no matter the amount of guns people buy each day. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Yeah but it’s easier for the media to say “race war lul” instead of doing anything constructive, and people eat that shit up. [end]
[start] The words "black lives matter" offend me because they are condescending and patronizing. They make it seem as if I am supposed to not already believe this. I am tired of being assumed to be a racist because I am white. As a result, I actually understand why black people would be angry that people assume they're dangerous because they're black.  White privilege does not exist. Black disadvantage does. If people keep trying to push shame and guilt onto white people, more people who used to not be racist, are going to become it, and there will be even more chaos. I won't be one of them, because I'm not a dumbass - but there are a lot of dumbasses in this country.  Also, the fact that everyone whines about anti-black racism while COMMITTING anti-white racism (and also, while ignoring the terrible oppressions occurring in countries other than America which are even worse than black people experience here - such as the occupation of Palestine by Israel), pisses me off. You can  decry the systemic racism in a system without blaming an entire race for it. [end]
[start] This shouldn't even be just about race! Don't get me wrong with black people only taking up 12% of the entire US population but accounting for as much as 30 to 50% of certain prison populations they are definitely disproportionately affected.  However it's our entire fucking system. Have you ever heard of the Tulsa massacre in Oklahoma. A very successful black town was pretty much destroyed because white people couldn't stand black people having success. Literally for Generations we have kept black people poor. And because of this and because of racism a lot of our laws were made to destroy anyone who was poor because they were the minority they were the people that you wanted to get rid of. We have quotes from presidents who have purposefully put in laws to teardown minority communities and make them into slaves in a prison house.  Here's the issue when 98% of all charges and employee agreements as a general average from the studies and statistics posted out. Certain local areas you can find some as low as 90% of all charges and in a plea agreement. Why?  Why would any innocent person sign a guilty paper?  Because as soon as you are charged with something in the United States before you even seen the judge you show up as if you are convicted. It's common practice for a district attorney to up your charges to felonies as soon as they hit their desk however they can. Before they have even seen you. You can get fired from your job because of that. You can be denied any reasonable employment because of that. And the district attorney can drag on the preliminary rounds for years until you just want to sign a guilty plea.  You can set in the jailhouse during the entire time these preliminary rounds are going on. And in my area if you decide to sit in the jailhouse so that way you can get a lawyer assigned to you because they won't if you're not sitting in the jailhouse. The state literally charges you 75 to $110 a day for maintaining you in the jailhouse. Let's say your bail was set to 3000. Your mother could pay a bondsman about 300 to 350 to go and bail you out. Oh but if she does that you're considered able to afford an attorney. It doesn't go off with pay stubs it doesn't go off of W-2s. It doesn't go off of anything else any other government programs such as food stamps energy assistance free lunches for your children or even college education. All of those government programs actually take pay stubs W-2 tax returns Etc. Not if you want a lawyer!  The laws are made to keep people down. They're made to make you pay. It's your guilty until you pay for innocent. You know all the politicians who have been noted for sexual issues a lot of the pedophile if she's were people had even been convicted but just go to another country for a few years and then come back and still work in Hollywood with children! How does this happen with their backgrounds it's because they paid it off!  Meanwhile a lawyer can cost 2 to $300 an hour. And a situation with the lawyer I had to get she wrote herself down as my lawyer before I had signed anything or done anything. No other lawyer would take me because in the documents and the county she was my lawyer. She wouldn't progress my case until I had paid for a full size thousand dollars. So the district attorney kept me in the preliminary rounds and kept kicking it down month by month. I still had to show up to the courthouse every single month just for them to stay after me waiting in line for hours with a bunch of other people because you can't show up whenever you have to show up at 9 a.m. and they might get to you by 2 p.m.  They just tell you come back next month we haven't done anything. Meanwhile they charge you for every single court date they have which they have to have every month. It's $80 each court date. Him down at the top so you can report this to your attorney general of your state but they're not going to do anything. Oh when you can file The Paupers affidavit to try to get a lawyer but that's determined by a judge. And they won't give you one! I have seen homeless people who are still sitting in the jailhouse denied lawyer! Merely because they didn't call the right ones when there's a list of 20 lawyer and they called 10 of them. But apparently not the right ones. This is a list that is posted in the jailhouse. Along with bondsman that are posted in the jailhouse.  Imagine going through all this all the wild charges of felony show up on your background you've lost your job but yet you're seeing is able to afford an attorney. This can go on for years! There's this one story of a man who killed himself because he was accused as a child of stealing a backpack and grew up in jail before they finally just dismissed all his charges because there wasn't enough evidence or anything. He had been so mentally damaged by the way they treated him he ended up killing himself a few years later. His family noticed that he never recovered socially.  But when we have had politicians and presidents literally Target minorities and make laws that would disproportionately affect minorities and how generally the rich people are white and can pay Off Their fines and pay for their innocence that is what this issue is about. But no one's fighting the lawyers or the judges.  No let's all just blame the cops and it's the individual cops problem not the states problem because multiple cops have killed people with these restraining procedures. But no let's only focus on these three cops that killed this one man and not focus on reforming the entire Justice System changing the way our judges lawyer's and everything work Arbonne system are jailhouse system and our police all at once. No let's just defund the police. If we do that we're just going to leave a lot of the private stores to only take care of their problem with their security forces and their police forces and then we won't have a police force to ever investigate them. As corrupt as our police force is it's because of a lot of the other system issues.  Our justice system needs to be burned completely and redone!  Oh also it's a really interesting fact that the pharmaceutical companies and medical companies in the United States have spent more than NASA has just for a lobbying to keep their prices high and hidden and everything else. This is why it cost us 17% of our GDP just to take care of the old people in our country. Also that and we see fast food as an essential service but not certain Medical Services. What a fucking piece of work. I can't wait till I'm dead or out of this country [end]
[start] These people are kind of bringing it on themselves though. They grow up being told that they are special and deserve everything, and whenever they don’t get what they want they call it racist. Many deal drugs for extra cash, then call it racist when they get pulled up and arrested. I’m not saying that white people are better, I’m saying that people should learn that illegal actions over several decades are *going* to start stereotypes about a certain type of person. Nobody is special, and *nobody* deserves anything. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Yes it is about race here in the USA. I don’t know why it has gotten so bad with Covid but it did. This is not the home I know [end]
[start] This is probably the scariest post ive read this entire year.   Why? Well due to monetary and political reasons, you can now with the help of technology manipulate/brainwash human beings into believing something false to be facts by creating fake “facts”.   We are sadly moving in the same direction as with the Salem witch trials. Where their excuse was ignorance and strong belief, ours is too much technology/information mixed with planted beliefs.   ....  After spending day in and out for the last 25 years digging into the subjects mentioned in the post and working closely with it. I will have to say that this entire post only contains   - A personal opinion. - Fabricated numbers. [end]
[start] Are we going to get any sources for the actual claims here? The only one of these that I have seen sourced elsewhere is the 1/1000 vs 39/100,000.   Also, why not present that as 100/100,000 vs 39/100,000? I think everyone is in agreeance that there is a racism problem within the US police force; we dont need to undermine the point by trying to make stats seem more incredible than they already are. [end]
[start] When you present an opinion and claim that its backed by facts, you have to source these facts from a trustworthy source. Why should I have to search for information when you're the one trying to convince me that colored people are getting discriminated against?  So far I haven't been able to find any documents that had any trustworthy documentation or refrences but it might be me idk.  Anyways while I definitely believe that there is racism in the states(I know because I lived in the states for 12 years before moving back to Korea), some of these facts sound ridiculous.  "White families hold 90% of the national wealth, black families hold 2.6%" - I couldn't find any source. But it is plausible considering only 13.4% of the population are colored folks. But you have understand it's only been 52 years since Mr.King died. You might think that it's a long time, but for a few centuries colored people were treated as sub-human by the majority of non-colored people and many of the caucausian younger generation at that time has grown to be an old man ingrained with those very same values. Considering that the majority of Americans are caucasian, you can easily predict the result of what would happen.  I absolutely think that there are things that have to be solved within society in the states but these changes simply can't happen in a short amount of time. There's a national crisis in the US at the moment and while I respect your noble cause, it's detrimental to the economy and stability of the country. That's my opinion but each to their own.  P.S y'all at the states should seriously impeach pancake face at the whitehouse. While Obama wasn't the best president, he still put the country and it's citizens as top priority. Meanwhile, the current president tear gasses his own citizens to take a picture of him holding a bible upsides down rofl [end]
[start] It's also historically aswell.  I'm a white person ok, I live in the UK - so I am privileged (but skint), but I have white privilege.  I have suffered from discrimination and stigma as have a mental health diagnosis of bipolar.  But that is only when people find out, and that is only when I'm in a situation where people are judgemental, so that is not, say walking into a shop, walking into a pub.  I only experience that, from a small minority of people, when I chose to tell them, and most nowadays (perhaps I'm better at choosing who I tell now) people have become more understanding of it.  &#x200B;  So my discrimination I have experienced, was only temperamental - I struggle to find employment (I get the interview, do well in some (most I do appalling), but they always find a reason not to hire me.  And because of the types of jobs I apply for, I have to disclose to them, but it's not required for me to disclose until I get the job offer, but cos I'm sick of getting the offer, and then they turn it down, I now put it on the application form in the supporting info bit such as 'I will tell you now rather than later, I have a mental health diagnosis.'  Because I'm sick of going through all the process, which for me, takes a lot of effort and stress, to be turned down at the last minute.   So I tell them straight up if I can, then I know I've got a better chance, and I know then it's something I've done wrong in the interview.  So I suffer discrimination that way.  &#x200B;  So if I imagine, and I cannot ever really understand, unless I was actually a black person, and a black person reading this might very well say, no it was nothing like that, because you don't really know until you have experienced it for yourself.  &#x200B;  But can you imagine being born, and then (even at 6mths old babies have the ability to smile back at you if you smile at them), that young ok - coming out of the safety of your family home, sitting in a pushchair, going to the shops.  Where a lot of people you see, strangers are not smiling at you.  And it happens and happens again, throughout your childhood, not just once a week, over and over again, whenever you go anywhere at school, or anywhere where their is white people,  How do you think that might be reinforced to a child?  That you are inferior.  Their parents might try to explain to a child or reinforce that they are special and that black is beautiful, but a young child might not fully understand.  And they just understand, that they are getting treated differently from white kids.  They see negative looks in people's eyes, when adults, and perhaps other children, look at them, and it's in their awareness.  But then on top of that - there is the knowledge, when they get a bit older, to understand how the colonists infiltrated Africa, and enforced their white supremacy onto black people.  Take South Africa for example, the apartheid, black people had all their rights removed.  They were not allowed to have insurance, they were not allowed to own their homes, they had to rent off a white landlord, they were only allowed to be slaves, for white people.  They had to live separately from white people.  And even when apartheid ended, it created even more problems as there were no jobs for them when slavery ended.  Not only that, they were denied an education, because white people decided to deliberately give kids, that would be at high school age at this point, having to recite the 2 times table.  Because white people didn't want them to become educated because they wanted to reinforce onto them that they are slaves.  But children grow up believing that they are inferior.  Yes their parents might be doing the opposite, but when the leaders of your country, and the white people that lived their was reinforcing it constantly, people actually believe that they are inferior as it has been drilled into them since the day they were born.  There parents might have still continued to believe they were inferior to white people.  Then white people forced Christianity onto them, white missionaries.  They were led to believe that Jesus was white with blue eyes, in Christianity Jesus is God, so they believed in God, believed in Jesus, and believed that God is white.  Reinforcing that , because of the colour of their skin they are inferior and that inferiority has come from God, because God is white with blue eyes.  &#x200B;  Then the slavery and the brutally that their slave owners gave to them, and I am no where close to what they might have experienced over and over again.  They would have been terrified of their slave owners no doubt.  They were nothing more than how we treat our pets, however, we love our pets and we don't make them work for us for us to get rich.  Then slavery got abolished.  The problems do not disappear overnight - the problems are present here today - and are no where near close to treating people with a little of bit of respect.  Trump comes to power, after their might have been a ray of hope when Obama came to power  - for a black person, can you imagine how amazing that must have felt to witness the first black president - and that's your black president in your country, who's intention wasn't to get involved in the Iraq war, which shadowed his time in office, his intention was to fight what he could for equality.  And he tried to do that with free health care for all.  Then Trump comes into power, people in the UK, white people were angry about that, but can you imagine listening to him and he's your president and you are black - can you imagine how that must feel.  I can feel angry at Trump, but I'm at a safe distance from him, in the UK, to not let it bother me too much.  So yeah, when black people see a white person, it reminds of them that we were the same colour as their oppressors.  And it's them that have to try really really hard each time, to keep themselves polite with us.  Because if it was me, I just couldn't do that I'd completely insane.  I could not cope with that level of anger they have suppress on a day to day basis when you look at how we have treated them for all this time.  &#x200B;  The Black Lives Matter is not due to one single event.  I don't understand why it's taken this long for them to start protesting, because what happened with George Floyd happens a lot in the US.  I didn't fully understand this until I read 'Just Mercy' by Bryan Stevenson a couple of years before.  I felt what happened to Eric Garner was even worse, because the trial went on for years, and the police got away with it and still work in the police force.  There has been loads of incidents similar to George Floyd - and I have only heard of  a small fraction of them,   Black people in America, are scared, on a day to day basis, that they might get shot down.  So that might be one of the reasons why it's taken so long for the pot to bubble over - out of fear perhaps.  I visited America just the once, and I felt scared, knowing people might be carrying guns.  Thinking all the time, be super polite, don't cause any bother, and I'm a white person.  I was terrified at customs in LA airport as that was the first time I'd ever seen a gun in real life (i'd only seen a gun on TV).  Trump goes on about the UK having a problem with stabbings.  Yes we have, but it's a small minority, and this small minority, the majority are kids, carrying knifes as they've got involved in smoking a bit of weed, feeling a bit scared as they've been introduced to other gangs that carry knifes.  Mostly the stabbings are within these gangs, the majority, so for me I feel safe to walk where I want without that worry.  If you live in a country when guns are just seen on tv, seeing a gun in real life, seeing someone carrying a gun in real life is terrifying for me.  In the US, that might not occur to mind because they are used them.  So yes, I'm glad I don't have to face what black people have to face, as I couldn't live day by day have to put on a lid on my rage that I feel.  And I have probably underestimated it, because I'll never ever really know how it feels and how it effects you because I have privilege, white privilege.  And I too, was led to believe, not from my mum, but from the media and how one of my school teachers treated the one black kid in my school, that black people are inferior.  For F\*\*k's sake - it's a skin colour due to different levels of pigmentation.  and knowing how ridiculous, the intolerance, of a different shade of skin makes us - and how dangerous and oppressive we have become.  I'm gonna stop here. [end]
[start] Disney will not allow a black character unless it is an animal?  This couldn’t possibly be because the majority of the US population has been Caucasian, could it?  Not saying Disney is not racist, because some of their depictions in their shows, but there are characters evolving now that are not exclusively Caucasian.  Maybe they were targeting a broad audience, without intending to marginalize a group.  Yes, there is room for growth, especially since we are in 2020, but to state they will not allow it without proof from Disney?  Far fetched. [end]

[start] And I quote Wikipedia:  >According to a study from the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Justice_Statistics)  from 2002 to 2011, among those who had contact with the police, "blacks  (2.8%) were more likely than whites (1.0%) and Hispanics (1.4%) to  perceive the threat or use of nonfatal force was excessive."[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-81)    >   >According to [*The Washington Post*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post),  police officers shot and killed 1,001 people in the United States in  2019. About half of those killed were white, and one quarter were black,  making the rate of deaths for black Americans (31 fatal shootings per  million) more than twice as high as the rate for white Americans (13  fatal shootings per million).[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-:1-82)[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-83) *The Washington Post* also counts 13 unarmed black Americans shot dead by police in 2019.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-84)    >   >A 2019 study by Cesario et al. published in [*Social Psychological and Personality Science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Psychological_and_Personality_Science)  found that after adjusting for crime, there was "no systematic evidence  of anti-black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of  unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of  harmless objects".[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-85)  However, a 2020 study by Ross et al. criticizes the data analysis used  in the Cesario et al. study. Using the same data set, Ross et al.  conclude that there is significant racial bias in police shooting cases  involving unarmed black suspects. This bias is not seen when suspects  were armed.[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-86)    >   >A study by Harvard economist Roland Fryer found that blacks and  Hispanics were 50% more likely to experience non-lethal force in police  interactions, but for officer-involved shootings there were "no racial  differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken  into account".[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-87)    >   >A study in [*PLOS One*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_One)  found "significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans  relative to unarmed white Americans" by police. The average bias measure  was that unarmed African Americans had 3.49 times the probability of  being shot compared to unarmed whites, although in some jurisdictions  the risk could be as much as 20 times higher. The study also found that  the documented racial bias in police shootings could not be explained by  differences in local crime rates.[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-88)    >   >A since retracted study in [*PNAS*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNAS)  claimed that black people were actually less likely than white people  to be killed by police, based off the death rates in police encounters.[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-89) A study published in the journal [*Nature*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)) that found such conclusions were erroneous due to [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox). The *Nature*  paper showed that it was true that white people were more likely to be  killed in a police encounter, overall black people were still being  discriminated against because they had far more interactions with the  police due to structural racism. The paper noted that black people have  far more interactions with the police per capita than white people, and  that black people tend to get stopped for more petty crimes or for no  crime at all. Conversely, white people tend to interact with police in  situations more rarely, and often in more serious crimes such as  shootings, where police are more likely to use force. Thus while it  appears that white people are killed at a higher rate, the datasets are  not comparable in such a simple fashion. The *Nature* paper also  backed up the findings of Ross and Fryer, and concluded that overall  rate of death was a much more useful statistic than the rate of death in  encounters.[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-90)[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-91)   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_Lives\_Matter#Police\_use\_of\_excessive\_force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#Police_use_of_excessive_force) [end]

[start] Bello [end]
[start] Hi [end]
[start] Holy. Your right It’s not about a few things it’s about all the things listed in the post. Weird how come the news hasn’t coved the actual facts. That means the media and news is just feeding the issue and not giving the right facts also called fake news [end]
[start] Big city police are deployed in high numbers to low-income African American communities. Why? Because that’s where most of the crime is. That’s where it has been since the 1920s, and especially since the 1960s. Such deployments were far less common prior to the 1960s, when black communities were severely under-policed. The result was impunity for many black violent criminals and, in turn, an incentive for black men to engage in more violence as a self-defense mechanism. The late 1960s changed this pattern. As black-on-white crime rose, police departments came under mounting pressure to control crime, much of which occurred in or near minority neighborhoods where it victimized black residents. African American violent crime rates soared between the 1960s and the early 1990s. During that period, in big cities, arrests of African Americans for homicide, the most accurate measure of violent crime, accounted for 65 to 78 percent of all homicide arrests. This is an extraordinary figure when one considers that the nonwhite population of these cities ranged from only 20 percent to a bit over 35 percent. The situation today has improved considerably. African American crime rates, and United States crime rates generally, have fallen dramatically. For all persons of all age groups, the homicide death rate fell 34 percent from 1990 to 2016. For black males in the same time frame, the decline was 40 percent. While violent crime has fallen, it nevertheless remains disproportionally high in communities of color. The latest police data collected by the FBI indicates that blacks comprised 58 percent of all murder arrests and 40 percent of those apprehended for all violent crimes. This disproportional involvement of African Americans in violent crime turns out to be the most significant factor of all in explaining the use of force against blacks by police. It will be no surprise that violent criminals in the United States are commonly armed and dangerous. For assaults, for instance, 71 percent of arrested persons carried firearms. Among suspected murderers, 58 percent had guns, as did 42 percent of apprehended robbery suspects. This tally doesn’t include the knives or blunt instruments recovered from violent offenders, including over 48,000 cutting instruments possessed by those arrested for assault alone. Police, of course, are well aware of this situation. Charged with a duty to apprehend offenders, they are—and must be—prepared to use force. Confrontations, often armed confrontations, in these circumstances are inevitable. Such confrontations will frequently involve white police and black suspects. Whites are a declining proportion of police departments in the United States, but they’re still close to half the force in big-city departments where white males make up 44 percent of full-time sworn officers. The Chicago Study As it turns out, when it comes to the use of force, the race of the police officer may not be significant. A study of 270 police shootings in Chicago from 2006 to 2014 found that the demographics of the officers who fired their weapons matched the demographics of the police department. Whites were 51 percent of the shooters and 53 percent of the force; blacks were 23 percent of the shooters and 25 percent of the force. In other words, there is no evidence that white police were more likely to discharge their weapons or that African American officers were less likely. This is especially noteworthy given the demographics of the shooting victims: 5 percent were white, 14 percent Hispanic, and an eye-popping 80 percent were black. Equally significant is the reason for the confrontation. In the overwhelming majority of cases (77 percent), the police were reactive, not proactive. They were responding, in the typical scenario, to a call about a violent crime. In the proactive situation (23 percent of the shootings), the officer initiated the contact, e.g., stopped a suspicious person. [end]
[start] One word, Fascism. What you see today isn't a product of a single event, this has been going on for years, way before most of us were born, this system is a process, a process with a current goal that's set up to make us all dependent on a government, to demoralize us and rid us of knowledge and understanding, fill our minds with rubbish and what they've done is create a human breed that's disconnected from reality, people are in denial and they will be untill a tragic event happens in their lives. Both political parties have plenty of flaws but the same agenda, starts with demoralizing a nation, destabilizing and then a sending a crisis, after this crisis with a violent change in power comes the normalization stage. People know your history or be doomed to repeat it! We need a revolution, a radical change, such change doesn't come peacefully just look at the past! Thank you for sharing your post OP, reddit is probably our last source of useful information gathered from average people not big corp like Google and whatnot. A time is coming where people are rising, people who are NOT afraid of death, people who will take it upon themselves to fight, to raise other leaders and warriors, we must remain mentally strong, not let fear control our minds, thoughts, lives and relationships. We need to grow emotionally, people have become so hurt and offended that a single look at someone taken the wrong way can result in death! Why? Who is responsible? ALL OF US JUST AS MUCH AS THOSE WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT AND SERVE. So many people don't know the constitution and it's role, the same people don't care, yet only start to care when they're affected somehow, and that's usually too late. Ideological subversion is a legitimate process and this isn't just happening in our country this is a global event and it seems as if those NWO conspiracies are starting to make sense. I still have hope because it's hard to accept that at the root of humanity there is so much evil and hatred. [end]
[start] Race is the face of another problem, an arguably worse problem in a way: the face that extremist Republicans refuse to accept Democrats or liberals as human. Like Lindsay Graham said, you can be black in SC “if you’re conservative”. [end]
[start] Don’t forget that an astounding majority of your facts (which I am absolutely not disputing) are a direct/indirect result of the Crime bill that JOE BIDEN wrote and sponsored [end]

[start] Could you unpin this post already? I know it's an important issue, but there's like 100 important issues going on in the world right now. And this is not even one of the most important, since this kills maybe a few thousand people a year? It's not that relevant anymore. There's gonna be some stuff done to your police, or maybe not. And it'll go away. Else we could maybe also talk about other things, like:  \- Hong Kong stopped being democratic and rumors of people being put in concentration camps  \- Coronavirus that has been killing 5000+ people a day for the past 8 months  \- Protests in Belarus [end]
[TITLE] Shaved my head and my family is mad [TITLE]
[start] Do you like your new look? Honestly if it makes you happy then that's all that matters. A new hairstyle isn't causing any harm to them whatsoever. Their response is completely on them and not your problem. [end]
[start] Bet you're from Italy [end]
[start] Run. Just run.   They are scared that you're getting independent. [end]
[start] What the fucking hell? Dude I’m so sorry you have to go through such bullshit. My brother in law just shaved his head after having long, gorgeous hair for years. When we all saw him, it was only compliments and love. That’s how it should be. You probably already know this, but your family sucks ballsacks for making you feel bad over a *haircut.* [end]
[start] I shaved my head at 20.  My mother looked disappointed and later took me aside in private to say “You look very ugly” like no one else wanted to say it.  My grandmother asked “did it work?” and when I asked what she meant she said she thought I was trying to “get rid of the bugs” in my hair.  Anyway, that was over 25 years ago and we all laugh about it now.  This will pass. [end]
[start] I mean, it's not like you shaved THEIR heads, right? They'll get over it. Ignore their dramatics and just keep living your life. [end]
[start] Sorry, sounds like the people around you are very shallow. There’s more to life than how you look. It has to be nerve-racking when you do something and think it’s not a big deal, and yet everyone has an opinion on it. I guess now you know for the future to do what you want and live on your own terms. I think it’s a step towards true freedom. [end]
[start] Is it something related to religion that makes them mad? The fact that they never allowed you to meet girls etc. gives the impression of a very conservative household?     You are 18 and have therefore reached age of majority. You have the right to do whatever you like with your hair, relationships or whatever.     Why should shaving the head even be a big deal? [end]
[start] I'm seeing this guy and he also started shaving his head because his hair was receding. He said it's been about 5 years and now he's really okay with it but it did take time for him to adjust. Personally, I really like it. I was surprised by it at first but it's grown on me.  Anyway, I guess my point is it'll take time for everyone to adjust. Even you. What's important, as others said, is it makes you feel more comfortable and confident. It's your head after all ❤️ [end]
[start] I was 18 when I shaved my head for the first time. (I’m AFAB.) My mother was pissed, but honestly that had been the plan for four years—I just didn’t have the guts to do it.   I totally get you on not looking for validation but also wanting it. The last thing we want is to disappoint our “loved ones”. If we do, it must mean they won’t ever like us again. And... all that dark stuff that doesn’t need to be spelled out here.  They’ll get over it. And if they don’t, well, good riddance. Can I ask what country you’re emigrating to? [end]
[start] lol wtf? tell your family you are your own person and can make your own choices. [end]
[start] Your parents need to grow a set of balls [end]
[start] They would probably have been happier to have you grow one side really long and do a comb over because then they could still pretend that you are not an adult making your own decisions. Own your new look. But do buy one of those rainbow colored clown wigs (the big curly ones) to wear when you visit them since, evidently, any hair is better than none.   I am always amazes at people who criticize someone else's hair. They are not the ones having to do the upkeep or worry about thinning. My husband is also follicularly challenged. When he decided to keep his head close shaven, it was like liberation day for him. No more worrying about how his remaining hair looked in proportion to the expanding bald area. He always looks neat and rugged. I bet you do as well.  When your family tells you they are mad about your hair,  remind them that it is a result of genetics which is their fault. Then tell them if the best they can do is be mad over your lack of hair, then you must be a pretty awesome dude! [end]
[start] As a boy I had longer hair (as in not boy short) much of my life.  Granted I have nice hair.  I remember sometime in my 20s deciding to take a trimmer with a guard on and take most of it off, to like an inch.  The first time my Mom saw me, she acted so upset.   She was already upset about my Dad spending money to buy a modern big TV and then she threw in the "and (me) cut his hair!"  It didn't really bother me, just felt typical.  My Mom had a lot of anxiety.   And at that point in my life I was used to people, including my parents and family, being upset or critical with my decisions.  It feels like no matter what I do, or we do, there's always somebody out there who doesn't like it and feels the need to tell us so.  Probably why my self confidence is never rock solid.   And I have tried to overcompensate with periods of not giving a fuck.  Such is life.   That's ultimately why I come to the conclusion that you can't care what other people think.   Even though I still do to some extent.   It's never all or nothing. [end]
[start] What the fuck. It's hair how the hell are they so upset about it. I'm sorry my dude [end]
[start] Don't pander to others self interest, do what you want and try to get away from them. [end]
[start] Do they realize it's just hair? There's got to be another reason why they're acting so overdramatic. It grows out! It's not like you went home with a face tattoo or a missing limb! [end]
[start] Don't feel bad. My friends and family did the same thing to me years ago too. They kept giving advice on how I should of just kept it and styled it different etc.  And I mean ALL of my friends and family.  They even had nick name insults that they thought were funny.  Chemo kid  Cancer boy  Racist  Kkk  It hurt, but I acted like It didn't.  Just go to show even your closest ones to you will judge you on your looks.  My own girlfriend at the time told me she was no longer attracted to me.  Going bald sucks. I been bald now longer than when I had hair. I don't give a fuck anymore.  What hurt most was how they all reacted in a negative way. I'm still the same person lol. [end]
[start] Damn that sucks. [end]
[start] They gonna get over it it’s just a haircut [end]
[start] What's up with looking down on Baldies that families have? I did the same thing! I'm 20 and started to lose too much hair, tho' I did go from metalhead long-ass hair to bald so I guess in my case it was sudden, but like, it's...it's just hair? Who cares? What, am I Samsom? Am I gonna suddenly be weak? Or a skinhead? No, I'm still dorky stupid dumbass me. Superificialities really annoy me honestly, not like I'm pretty either, so eh, nothing changed other than folks being drama queens about it. [end]
[start] Rock it man. They will get used to it. [end]
[start] Just tell them “Seth Everman energy” and leave it there.  And they should support you. Jeez! [end]
[start] A very good friend of mine went from being a depressed early-20-something with a severely receding hairline to a confident early-30-something with a shaved head. He lived at home and barely socialized at the worst of it, now he has a great job, a wife, and a baby due in a few weeks. I won't say that shaving his head literally turned his life around, but I do think that there was a symbolic importance to the act for him.  I'm sorry your family isn't supportive, that must really hurt. But, from a total internet stranger, I praise you for this awesome act of self-acceptance and wish you nothing but the best in life! [end]
[start] I am so confused.  Is there a religious aspect here that is causing this emotional reaction from your fam?  Your head, your choice. [end]
[start] Sounds like they are mad that you did it without their permission.  I can see a kid being startled and crying but adults not speaking to you?  That’s just ridiculous. [end]
[start] Wtf why would anyone be bothered by that? That is very strange behaviour. [end]
[start] This is either fake or you're in a really weird situation.  I'm a fellow head-shaver and have been for more than a decade.  It's a source of endless compliments.  I've never heard of anyone getting the amount of pushback you're describing. [end]
[start] Had long hair for over 20yrs, kept being told to get a haircut, my only response was idgaf and if I ever do get a haircut it'll be shaved off as I really cba dealing with hair gel on a daily basis especially in a country where the weather is mostly stationary rain hanging in the air or horizontal rain. So one day last year during a blisteringly hot summer, the heat madness made me realise that getting rid of a lions mane would help me cool down and holy crap was I wrong, it was still blisteringly hot just now I need suncream on the dome and the slightest breeze was like a -40 Arctic chill... Pretty much got the same response from the maternal unit, long story short, they'll get used to it if you keep shaving it! [end]
[start] tf it’s your own head [end]
[start] Um..do they realize hair grows back? [end]
[start] To be honest your family’s reaction sounds quite pathetic. Is the quality of their life or relationship with their son determined by the amount of hairs on his head? No. This decision has nothing to do with them and their obsession over it is disturbing. [end]
[start] Jesus I didn't know people could act like that. You're doing something completely normal. Your family wants to control you completely. Stay strong, a lot of us feel like we don't have freewill and the freedom to be our real selves. Don't let them stop you, even be worse so they can get some perspective. If you never do anything wrong even small things will be tret like you killed their cat. It's also so unhealthy for your mentality to not be able to be who you really are. You've got to fight to be your real self, shaving head is progress towards that goal. Also become slightly more sneeky eg get a girlfriend, use a guy friend to cover for you. [end]
[start] I remember when my (then) boyfriend (now husband) shaved his head after years of his hair thinning. He was really nervous but after he shaved it- he never looked back. I love his head bald. Now his favorite thing is he can say he’s “bald by choice” lol I’m sorry your family’s reaction was hurtful. But it sounds like the first of many decisions you’ll make as an adult about your own life that won’t make your controlling family happy. [end]
[start] My family didn’t like that I shaved my head but I like it and that’s all that matters. As long as you can wake up everyday and enjoy looking at your bald head in the mirror then it’s the right thing to do. Plus eventually you will move out and they will miss that bald head [end]
[start] Hey, I understand not getting validation from your family feels really bad. You need to talk it out with them. If you can bear the consequences and will be ready for it, let the argument heat up let them say everything that they have to and while they do this you should not only let them speak, say what's in your heart. There are two possible outcomes, they will come to terms with your decision or things may turn bad(I won't point out in what ways, you can easily imagine what can happen).  If you things turn bad with your family, you need to leave. You have taken this step for a reason, they need to accept this. If they cannot, there is no reason for you to live while passively facing such treatment, unless you are still dependent on them.  All this is of course your choice.  One thing I wanted to make sure, there is no cultural thing about getting your head shaved, is there? For eg., among hindus men in family shave their head when their mother/father dies. [end]
[start] Gonna need a before and after pic... [end]
[start] I think you’re chill. Let your family be disappointed, it shouldn’t matter that much to you. I disappoint my parents everyday haha it’s your life. [end]
[start] That's a very strange reaction from your family. Going bald really isn't that weird. If someone I knew shaved their hair, I'd be like "oh hey I noticed you shaved your hair" and nothing else would happen. [end]
[start] How does your shaved head affect their life. It simply doesn’t. They’re dumb for caring so much. Would they have acted differently if you donated to cancer? Make that your excuse lol. I am both surprised and furious that your hair would make such an impact on their mood. If my brother did the same I’d probably throw a couple jokes then forget it the next day. [end]
[start] I walked on egg shells in marriage for ten years before an inept barber forced the issue. It’s been brilliant, I’m basically 6 inches of Dwayne Johnson.   It’s the wrong six inches, but in 15 years I’ll get his body too! The ex knew what they were doing, and I’m guessing your family do to: they’re afraid to lose you to press, dates and fame.   Just remind them that you’ll never forget them when you’re famous. [end]
[start] Lol really? Some people are too crazy about hair, who cares honestly. If you wanna shave, you  shave. It's not like you did a face tattoo. Your family should be ashamed by giving that much shit about stuff that 1: Doesn't matter. and 2: Something you wanted to do.  Stuff like this cause more damage to you than they think. Stuff like this make you insecure about your own opinions. This is not good in the long run. Don't bother about them. They are wrong, you are right! [end]
[start] Yeah, they don’t know how cool you look. Give it time, they will get used to it. Live for yourself man, not them. If your parents love you truly, they will come around to respect the decision. Mine did.   I know you became 10 X hotter with that new confident look. [end]
[start] I was about 20 when I finally admitted the truth and shaved my head, but for about 5 more years I still had enough in the middle to occasionally grow a mohawk. One time I went to see my parents with a pink mohawk and I ended up not speaking to my family for 7 months. It changed the nature of my relationship with my dad and we're much more copacetic now.  Next step - get someone you find attractive to rub your shaved scalp. That shit's the jam.  It sounds like your parents are overprotective; you should seriously look at this as a first time setting some boundaries that will allow for a healthier, more adult relationship. "From now on, if you like what I'm doing with my hair you can complement it, but nothing you or I do will make me less bald so you're not allowed to comment in the other direction. Consider this a general statement on things that are only skin deep, not just about my shaved head." [end]
[start] Bruh, if your family is really that upset over a haircut maybe you need to distance yourself a little. [end]
[start] I would've totally flipped the script on them by saying "Don't act like this isn't the fault of your shitty genetics mom & dad." [end]
[start] Sound like a bunch of weirdos. It will be back in a month anyway. Not that it’s any of their business what’s on your head. Embrace you [end]
[start] It sound like they see you as *their* child, instead of your own person that happens to be their child. Like, you damaged their property of something. Like you keyed their car [end]
[start] Yeah, my hairline began receding at 18 and at 23 I decided to just shave it all off. Thing is I get a lot more compliments about it because I shave it constantly and keep it looking clean. I like the look, and it’s way better than those guys who do everything they possibly can to keep their obviously balding hairlines going. Just embrace it. Plus, I didn’t have to worry about finding a barber during the pandemic haha. It literally hurts nobody, if you like it keep it. [end]
[start] your family needs to grow the fuck up. you have my sympathy having to deal with them:/ [end]
[start] Shaving your hair is not really such a bad thing. I did it a couple of times while I was young. It really helps the head rest from the hair.  When I did it the first time, my family was upset. But that was because they where not used to seeing me with a shaved head.  Most people don't react in a positive way to changes. So don't let it bother you. You are still you. It's not like your hair will never grow up again. I think your family is just overreacting because they where used to look at you with a hair and the sudden change make them feel uncomfortable. However, the important thing is for YOU to feel ok. [end]
[start] Great priorities ur family has [end]
[start] Hey! Bud! I did the same thing! I feel great for it. I've gotten mostly great responses, and a few hesitant or negative ones, which is what I'd expect for any major transformation. There's always only the one response:  "I did this for me, not for you."  I'm sorry your family sucks. [end]
[start] That sucks, mate. I honestly think hair is the absolute dumbest thing to be mad about. It grows back if YOU don't like the look. But what YOU like is all that matters. Family just downright are asshats sometimes though, and so I send you an internet-mom-hug! [end]
[start] Your family's fucking weird for this. [end]
[start] Bald guys are sexy [end]
[start] Its kinda crazy they're acting like this over a haircut...you do you, if they love you (which I'm sure they do), they'll come around...if they wont talk to you because of a haircut...I mean come on. [end]
[start] Your family is nuts. I went bald in my early twenties and have kept it short/shaved ever since. [end]
[start] Why is it so upsetting? [end]
[start] You are still you, fabulous you. Your hair was just going along for the ride. [end]
[start] I’m sorry your parents are reacting this way.   Do your best to not let their reaction hurt you.  I know it’s easier said than done.  If you like your look, then embrace.  They will grow into it.  You made a decision about your body, if they don’t ever get past this, then it’s their problem.    I use a #1 guard on my head and just love it.  I wish I would have done this years ago. [end]
[start] Lol who the fuck gets mad about what someone else does with their hair. [end]
[start] that's crazy. sounds like they can't accept you getting older maybe?   at first I thought this was going to be a girl who shaved her head given the reaction but I wouldn't expect it for a guy. It's not exactly an unusual "hairstyle" [end]
[start] Well come to the Chome Dome club brother. You are an alpha now. lol. I joined the balled headed club when I was 24. Been bald suits me and is so easy to maintain. Also you tend too look more masculine when you bald. You have joined a prestigious club brother. The Rock, Jason Statham, Vin Diesel, Tyrese, Bruce Willis, Stonecold Steve Austin and myself all welcome you. CHOME DOME FOR LIFE BABY!! [end]
[start] your parents are dumb and your niece is probably too young to understand...  i had the similar experience [end]
[start] It is a ridiculous reaction to you shaving your head. You are your own person and have every right to shave it if you want. I also shave my head and I love the way it feels. I know it is hard to be around their reactions, but you are not hurting anyone with your choice and you only live once ! [end]
[start] im gonna be blunt with this. your family are shitty. not to mention toxic. if they can't support all of you then they are not worth any of your time. being closed of that why is hard to get though and you finding a way to do that. If they don't like it tell em to fuck off. you don't have to be nice with this either. loving yourself that's what matters. if your hurt tell em upfront to. if they can't deal with this then they are not what a family should be. [end]
[start] Jesus it’s just hair. Wtf is wrong with people? Do you, man. I’m sure you look awesome! [end]
[start] You do you. They will get over it eventually, it's just hair. [end]
[start] Can you help me understand the de-humanizing feeling you're experiencing? [end]
[start] Now you need to buff-up to complete the package. Time to start weight lifting. No one cares if a man with a 6-pack is bald. [end]
[start] Shaved my head at 22. Way better than the receding. Good on you for letting it go. Confidence is more attractive than hair [end]
[start] My family was surprised to be sure but that is just uncalled for. Worst I got was a worried look from my father because I was going through a lot at the time I first shaved my head. He was just worried I did it based on some rash decision or external influence. [end]
[start] Fuck them. It’s your fucking hair. My mom still tries to tell me what to do with my hair and I’m almost 30. Good thing she lives in a different state now [end]
[start] You’re a grown ass man, you literally don’t need their approval for anything. [end]
[start] Lol bro make them pay for a hair transplant [end]
[start] It's probably just a little shock from your new appearance. My partner is bald (and he's SO hot to me, btw), but he has a large beard that I'm very, very attached to. Occasionally he shaves it off- usually without telling me first- and, as weird as it sounds, I am literally repelled by how he looks at first. We jokingly call my reaction "trauma" bc it seriously does freak me out.  I will always prefer him with a beard, but after a few days the shock wears off and I get used to it. I bet the same will happen with your family.  Regardless, I'm glad you made the choice that feels good to you, and that makes you feel good about yourself! Confident bald men are super sexy! [end]
[start] Sounds like the perfect first step to reminding your parents that you need to grow as a person & a man. It is really good that you have moved out. And please try not to let their disappointment control how you live.  I know it’s hard but this is what we call the long game. Continue learning about girls, life, education. (Just don’t marry or have babies with the first girl who you think you love. Relationships take a lot of practice ) And continue to establish the life that YOU want & hopefully your parents will realize that you are doing just fine & stop worrying about you.  Don’t over explain yourself because Doing that gives everyone else control to continue to judge you. Say this, “It’s what I wanted. Oh I completely believe it is best. I am happy with my choices. And as an adult I may or may not regret my choices but being an adult means I’m taking responsibility and will live with my choices.” Good luck sweetie I’m proud of you. You are so very brave. [end]
[start] Well if it's any consolation, my Nana got the same reaction when she "bobbed" her hair 100 years ago. And you might try clipping it down to maybe 5mm for a suedehead rather than a cueball look. I went suedehead around the turn of the century, due to thinning, and I'm happy with the results. [end]
[start] Their reactions are really weird and over the top. My brother also shaved his head once and it made him look like a thug but no one got upset about it. We just made fun of him a bit. [end]
[start] It's hair FFS. Your hair to be exact, and you can do whatever the hell you want with it. [end]
[start] Screw the haters, men who are balding or have a receding hairline 150% look and (from the ones I know personally) feel better with a shaved head. You should always do whatever makes you happiest, regardless what your friends or family think (so long as no one gets hurt, obviously). I'm sure you look amazing with the shaved head :D [end]
[start] They sound like fucking weirdos shaved head normally looks better keep it [end]
[start] I was confused about their reaction until you mentioned that they’ve always been overprotective of you.  Shaving your head is a big statement - it’s against conformity and showing you want to take control of your image - and that is a lot to swallow for a family that doesn’t want to see you as an individual.  It sounds like you’re still struggling with this too. It’s healthy and normal to consider the opinions of loved ones, but they shouldn’t hold too much weight, especially when you’re all adults.  They’ll get used to your appearance, they don’t really have a choice, but I think this will be good for everyone looking back. You can do what you want and they can’t stop you, only support you. [end]
[start] Shave their heads too [end]
[start] Ugh I’m so so sorry you have to deal with that. This is also a trigger for me. Just remember, NOBODY should treat you differently based on the way you want to express yourself with your hair, clothing, etc. If they do, we probably need to question why they want to control us instead of love us. But most of all, take care of your happiness first. You are always enough by being your true self. [end]
[start] Welcome to the clan, brother!!  &#x200B;  It's fucking amazing, you don't have to worry about taking care of your hair or anything. I trim mine once a week with a #2 blade (6.3 mm) and it always feels just amazing. I prefer keeping a bit of length because it can block the sun some during the summer and helps keep my head a bit warmer in the winter. In Italy though I feel like winter isn't much of a concern for you as it is for me in Chicago. Of course I shampoo and condition every day (I have a beard too, so mostly it's for that), but I really don't need to use much.  &#x200B;  I highly recommend getting yourself a nice pair of clippers and cutting your hair yourself frequently, it'll keep you feeling and looking better.   &#x200B;  You're going to love keeping your head shaved or closely trimmed. [end]
[start] My family made negative comments for ALL my haircuts through my life.   Too short  You should cut them  Too eccentric  Too proper  You had such beautiful hair before, such a shame...  (Hahaha i just saw the comments about Italian families and they are of Italian descent!) [end]
[start] Small tip. Learn not to care what people think. I mean sure I'd yearn for some meaure of acceptance from friends and family but i wouldn't let their opinions influence my decisions. I'm rocking that haircut. Deal with it. Just act like you don't care trust me. [end]
[start] I shaved my head at 17 and had the same reaction. It sucked. Real bad. Im 23 now though and everyone else can go fuck themselves [end]
[start] Embrace the bald, I bet it looks good [end]
[start] People had a similar reaction when my boyfriend shaved his head for the first time, but your parents sound very overly sensitive. It's your hair not theirs! [end]
[start] Wigs are a thing [end]
[start] Damn, its just hair. It grows back. I dont understand why its such a big deal to your family?  You're not the crazy one here. I bet you look great! [end]
[start] Ok we gotta see this ... got a pic ? [end]
[start] It's a love-in!  You do you, my smooth-headed friend. [end]
[start] Take no notice they will eventually get over themselves. [end]
[start] Sorry to hear about your selfish family.  If you like it then it doesn’t matter what your insecure family thinks.  Live your life as you want it and fuck those who think you have responsibility for their feelings.  They need to grow up and take some responsibility for their own feelings and reactions to life around them.   My dad was the same but fuck him. We can’t live our lives making other people happy all the time. Always put yourself and your feelings first, but don’t be a asshole about it.   I bet you look great tho but like I said, fuck what I think as long you are happy with your decision.   I respect you for your choice! [end]
[start] Minoxidil? [end]
[start] wtf is wrong with them? Such a weird and crazy reaction.       Just keep doing it this way, they'll get used to it in no time. [end]
[start] Tell your folks if they wanted beautiful hair on their son, they should have passed on better genes. Their fault entirely. [end]
[start] Your family is stupid.  What the fuck does it have to do with them? [end]
[start] I’m confused [end]
[start] I’m 19 years old and had severely damaged hair that was my own fault after constant coloring and bleaching, and I made the impulsive choice to shave my head. I regretted it for about a day but ever since, I swear to everyone it’s the best choice I ever made for my hair. Notice I’m not taking into account other opinions, because they don’t matter. If you love it and rock it, and have confidence in yourself, that’s all that matters. [end]
[start] Do they know it grows back? Not that you have to let it, but they’re acting like you chopped down the last maple tree ever and syrup is a thing of the past. That would be a crisis; a haircut is not. [end]
[start] TLOU2 Vibes [end]
[start] Fake. For internet points. [end]
[start] No ones opinion of you matters. What matters is how you feel. If you like it, fuck em. [end]
[start] odd....a couple of years ago i shaved my head because my wife thought i would look good...not loosing my hair at all. i have kept it that way ever since because i like it. it looks good and is easy to keep.  but i NEVER got any negative feedback from anyone. so i have no idea why they acted as they did. [end]
[start] I'm sorry you're dealing with this.   I am proud of you for taking a stand. It's your body, they have no say. Be strong. [end]
[start] That’s quite an over reaction on their part and seems like a toxic environment. I’m sorry that’s happened but it’s great that you love it! Don’t let this affect you..  You should take a look at this account on tiktok (or Instagram same name) -> @kreftscouch you’ll see why.   Sending good energy to you. [end]
[start] Probably thought you had a serious disease like cancer [end]
[start] Where are u from bro?  My family will probably have a good laugh if I did the same [end]
[start] Fuck em! Rock it my bald brother!! I waited until my mid 30s and I should have started sooner. Pro tip the ladies shaving gel keeps my dome super smooth. Have some gold too brother! [end]
[start] I don’t understand. What is their problem with it? Is it a religious thing? [end]
[start] Lmaoooo  Good. Good. Let the hate flow through them. It's your body. I hope you've got a thousand other messages in your inbox supporting you, but I want to chip in all the same.  Attract the people you want with the body you desire. [end]
[start] As a fellow bald man, welcome to the club! We have meetings on the third Tuesday of every month where we discuss pop culture, politics, and rub our heads together to give each other strength. [end]
[start] You had me at "after years of having a receding hairline" but you are just 18? [end]
[start] their reactions are completely out of line, i'm sorry you have to deal with that. your body, your hair, your head, your choice. if they don't have anything nice to say they shouldn't say anything at all.   my dad started losing his hair at only 17 years old. he is in his 50s now and since i was a toddler (i am 22) he has shaved his entire head. i think he looks great. i also think it makes him look much younger and better than he would look if he did not shave his head and instead looked balding.   my only comment on your newly shaved head: SUNSCREEN EVERYDAY!! even in the winter! no matter where you live and what your skin tone is! it will be exposed a lot and you're still super young so you have lots of time to make sure you use the right SPF for you. [end]
[start] It's your head Do what pleases you.. I shaved my head this summer due to fact barbers were still not open.. I since then grew it back with winter around the corner.. You.. Did it for a noble reason So Be It [end]
[start] When i first shaved my head at 17 i arrived home at 2am,2 hours after curfew, and my mother took one look at me and told me that i 'look like a convict' in an angry / disgusted tone. Wasn't nice and it didn't help that i was tripping balls at the time. Youll get through this but hang tight, its your head! [end]
[start] I am sorry for you. Your familly... Act like a bunch of assholes. About your niece I can understand but I don't understand your familly. Do you have a terminal deases? Because if not I don't see why they would react in such a dramatic way. They acted like you told them you got drafted and forced to go to the front of the battles. [end]
[start] You mentioned immigrating to another country.  Where do you originate from and where are you now?  Maybe this is a cultural thing?  Because in the US at least, it's fairly common for guys to shave their heads even if they aren't balding. [end]
[start] Honestly, as long as you like you you look f'em. They sounds far to concerned with what they've deemed socially acceptable and care far too much on things that don't need to be care about much at all.   If you want to stick it to the you can show up with a (temporary) tattoo on the dome, really givem a scare.  Other than that as long as your happy and confident, it's none of their concern. Your hair not theirs. [end]
[start] Ok the niece crying I can understand but your da holding back tears is weird as hell, unless he thinks you’re going nazi skinhead or something. Clarify with your family it’s just you embracing the bald, not you becoming a hateful fascist or anything [end]
[start] I realize you have gotten a ton of comments but you prompted me to think! So I still want to share :)  I really think that our life is a process of learning to separate ourselves and to stand in our own “sense of identity” regardless of what others ultimately think of us. Becoming truly confident in who we are is such a process! It’s amazing how much others are affected by what we do (such as shaving your head) as if it really affected THEM. And then their response wants to TRY to really affect you! Isn’t that so interesting ?  I mean , it is hard hard hard to allow other people to deal (or NOT deal!) with their own various issues, whatever they may be and then not take them ON. You are awesome !! You are being successful and smart in how you are fighting to establish your solid self esteem! We ALL have to do it ! And I am so proud of you!!!! Thanks for sharing ! Rub that big old bald head of yours for me! And fight on little brother ! [end]
[start] As a fellow baldy...it’s liberating! Keep shaving it, my friend. [end]
[start] I know I'm dating myself and this might be unfamiliar to you, but:  * Telly Savalas * Yul Brynner  These men were iconic to me when I was growing up. [end]
[start] You can't please everyone. That is a sad reality of life, they will get over it if they care about you.   Situation sucks. [end]
[start] It’s their fault for having shit genetics they can’t be mad at you OP [end]
[start] i can’t imagine why they would be sad or mad at you. A hair cut garners a “wow you look awesome” at most, but definitely not a negative reaction. it’s honestly baffling [end]
[start] I read your username as “proudbaldy” at first [end]
[start] Man, fuck that noise. I started losing my hair about the same time as you I'm guessing. I was around 14 or 15. As you know, pretty traumatic in high school. The best thing I ever did was progressively trimming it shorter and eventually shaving it. I've been doing that for about twenty years now and it's great. Saved money and time and I like how I look better anyway. I'm sorry your family didn't accept that! What matters is that you accept it. [end]
[start] Their feelings towards your new look is their problem not yours. You love your new look and that’s good enough reason for you to keep it. Maybe it’s just the newness of it all. Give them time to adjust. Oh, and I think bald is sexy 😉 [end]
[start] Bro I'm so sorry to hear of your hairline at 18 already. But for real idk what the deal is with your parents. Like sure it's weird and you can laugh it off and say hey I wanted to shave it to treat my scalp better, haha look at my shaved head. But they're acting like you tattooed a big fat swastika on your head or some shit, get a grip people. [end]
[start] Your family is a bunch of weirdos for getting emotional over your hair.  I bet you look great! And how you feel is all that matters💜 [end]
[start] Like Heisenberg? [end]
[start] Your family doesn’t hate you.  It’s a haircut.  You’re an adult, be one. [end]
[TITLE] If you live in Alaska and voted for Trump, [TITLE]
[start] 100% true. The Trump culters are the dumbest fuckers on earth but the ones in Alaska have to be the dumbest of all.  And here's the sad thing - in a year they'll all blame Biden.   Dumbest mother fuckers on earth. [end]
[start] I saw that on the news, they're selling areas of land to companies to start drilling for oil and shit, it's ridiculous [end]
[start] I live in Alaska and did not vote for Trump.  I am very angry of all that is happening here. Not only is all the drilling happening, but Trump undid Obama regulations on ANWR that were put in place to protect this area. ANWR is one of the last "untouched" wilderness areas in the world. [end]
[start] Sheesh I was wondering about that too....  Good job Alaska smh.... [end]
[start] What Trump-voting Alaskan would have called themselves a conservationist in the first place? [end]
[start] That's happening? I thought the supreme court stopped it [end]
[start] I was sickened and so upset when I saw this on the news. It’s disgusting. [end]
[start] And experts were saying that there's plenty of oil to be drilled in the lower 48, no need to drill in AK. [end]
[start] for anyone who voted for or likes trump.  your ‘president’ is having a fucking temper tantrum in the whitehouse and you think he’s fit to lead america?    some americans are just dumb as fuck, no offence to the smart americans (mfs who didn’t vote trump) [end]
[start] Giiiit errrrr doneeee [end]
[start] I don't know much about the issue but it seems like oil drilling would have a relatively tiny impact as a portion of land area in Alaska. Alaska is really big and it sort of seems like oil drilling doesn't have to be very high impact. Is the concern related to possible oil spills? [end]
[start] As someone who lives in Alaska and voted for trump i can tell you very few of us are  conservationist. The only thing most Alaskans care about is increasing oil production, because we are entirely dependent on it. [end]
[start] Sooooo what you going to do without oil?? [end]
[TITLE] Your words matter [TITLE]
[start] I was totally expecting a sad story, so now I'm crying anyway because I'm really glad there are nice teachers like this out there [end]
[start] Yeah, my English teacher is the reason I decided to learn it. Thanks to that I could move abroad.  Shit, I gotta find her on Fb and thank her. [end]
[start] This is so true. I wrote previously on another thread about a relief teacher who somehow took a liking to me and praised a book I wrote and illustrated in front of the whole class. She also encourged me to enter a poetry contest that I would never otherwise have. I won it and still have the little crochet owl that was the prize.   School was my respite from home, where my parents did nothing but point out my flaws. Having this teacher point out talents and genuinely seem to care about my efforts stayed with me forever. I learned years later that she had passed away and I never got to thank her. But i think she probably knew how important that experience was to me.   I’m in my 30s now and have always been an avid reader and lover of education. It’s something I also try to instill in my kids. I hope to lift them up like she did me [end]
[start] You need to find her, and get her signed copies of your books. You have been challenged. [end]
[start] Butterfly effect in action🦋 [end]
[start] You’re damn right words matter. This got me right in the feels thinking about some teachers who encouraged me. One of my favorite teachers died suddenly last year from an infection she got while traveling around the world (she was a badass), and I wish I’d realized there would be no more time. So huge thanks for sharing your story & happy cake day, friend! [end]
[start] Reasons like this are why I became an elementary teacher. Thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] This is one of the best Reddit posts I've ever seen. From the bottom of my heart, Congratulations. [end]
[start] Happy cake day! When my son was in 5th grade, one of the teachers told him how awesome he did on his writing assignment. She then told him whenever he decides to write a book, she will pay for the publishing. He’s now in 7th grade, top of his class & in National Junior Honors Society. He is so eager to be someone important!  Teachers play a big role on letting our kids know they can achieve such great things. I appreciate them all! Congrats on all the books. That’s so awesome! [end]
[start] Goes the other way too. Had a band teacher that ruined me from music early in my childhood. Told me even though I could play the intermediate pieces without issue, I could not advance since I didn’t spend the proper amount of time as a beginner. Fuck that guy for holding me back. I still became a good musician eventually anyway but I always wondered if I would have had an easier time of it or a more diverse experience had that guy not been a tight wadded fuck clown. [end]
[start] As a teacher of 28 years, I love to hear stories like this.  It's very rewarding hearing from past students that we made a difference in their lives.  Keep up the great work! [end]
[start] What a beautiful story. Aren’t some teacher amazing! [end]
[start] Beautiful :) [end]
[start] This is amazing! I am so glad you had this experience. I personally had both positive moments with educators, similar to the one you described and negative ones. Interestingly the one that sticks out in my mind and sort of helped shape me into who I am today was a teacher who told me I was going nowhere in life. This actually had the effect making me work harder to prove her wrong and I now have a pretty successful career doing what I always wanted to do.   Thanks for sharing though, and yes words do matter! [end]
[start] I shared this with my company. Thank you for your post and reminder!  When I was 15, I had a scout after my baseball game tell me I could be a major league pitcher. I woke up at 6 am everyday for the next 7 years to get an extra workout in, changed my diet, and had a level of focus that I have a hard time replicating. I didn’t make the level of success that you had but I now can look back at my baseball career and see it as a success. Words matter. Someone believing in you matters. [end]
[start] I still remember all of the little meaningful words of encouragement I’ve been told by my middle school/high school teachers. They always feel more genuine coming from a teacher. [end]
[start] It's so easy to offer encouragement and kind words to people. Something so small and effortless can have such a major impact on the receiver. I'm glad you became a writer after that encounter, OP [end]
[start] This is the wholesome shit I needed to see.  I still remember when my seventh grade English teacher told me she was always excited to grade my work because she thought I wrote very well. Those words are so small in the moment but they end up meaning so much [end]
[start] I wrote a story about a year ago that got 800 readers and I was just fooling around on a small story writing website. I was considering going back and editing it or writing more stories and giving it a shot professionally but when I look back at the words I read I just cringe for some reason idk why. [end]
[start] Did you ever tell her?  Edit: disregard, i see the response above [end]
[start] Omg did u tell her how much she helped u?? [end]
[start] I was fortunate to have met several amazing teachers throughout my life. The subjects they taught didn't interest me very much but the lives they lived and stories they shared have influenced who I am today.  "a teacher affects infinity" [end]
[start] Not what I expected when I came here. Not sure what to say except thanks for making this post. [end]
[start] this. wouldve never escaped my abusive families or made it through college degrees if a few my teachers didnt nurture my love for knowledge and especially language. [end]
[start] Wish my teachers were like this [end]
[start] Can we get an Amazon link to buy ur book? [end]
[start] There's the idea of the pygmalian effect that essentially boils down to life being self fulfilling prophecies. If you say something will happen enough times, it's much more likely to happen (unless it goes against the laws of physics) [end]
[start] I remember when I was 5 and my piano teacher said I would never be able to play piano because I didn't have the right fingers (I don't understand how my fingers differed from the next kid) but those words had an effect and they destroyed me.   My piano playing fingers type more than 100 wpm now, so there's that... [end]
[start] Thanks for sharing your sweet story with us! Can I read your books? [end]
[start] Can we see the story?? [end]
[start] Happy cake day!! Also, what are your books about? [end]
[start] Ladies and gentlemen, this is what we call survivorship bias.    How many writers have pursued dead end careers because of "encouragement"?  Same with actors and artists.  Far too many [end]
[TITLE] I really need help. I have so much baggage to unpack and it's consumed me. I have no idea what to do in life anymore. [TITLE]
[start] You should open or join an online e-shop and hit different videogames subreddits and make a sample artwork for each of them and post it.   If its good, people gonna quickly ask where can they buy one for themselves. Then you link them to your shop. Many artists made big money from reddit thanks to a single post.   In the meantime, get a regular job as well. You need a constant cash flow.   On facebook, everyone's life look perfect, but its all just flexin for the last bucks. Behind that, their life has many issues as well.  It is proven scientifically that reading Fb posts makes you upset.   You sound like a beautiful girl. Be proud of your hair you dummy!  You're an adult now and you gotta take care of yourself. You have to let the pain go and move on.   You dont owe anything to anyone. You own who you are.  Dont give up baby, tommorow is another day. You gotta promise to yourself that you gonna try no matter what.   I moved out the house at 16 because of the toxic family. Now im 25 living in another country, happy and free.   You can do it! Dont give up!   Also go and meet some nice guy with a work and stable life.   Best of luck. [end]
[start] First of all, I just want to say that it was very brave of you to decide to open up. That can be the hardest thing in the world to most people, and its also the gateway to change. Simply being willing to acknowledge any of this, even to strangers, is a huge and wonderful step you've already made.   It breaks my heart to know that you have spent so much of your life, so traumatized by your own appearance. I think you sound beautiful, and intelligent, and worthy, and lovable, because you ARE. Don't you ever let anyone tell you otherwise. I completely understand the desire to control things/others because of a lack of control growing up. Not even an ounce to your extent, but I can understand that. I don't think it makes you a psycho, I think that's quite normal.   I'm just so sorry. I wish I could take away your pain and rewrite what you went through. But, the beautiful thing is that we always have the now. No matter what our past was, we can always change as much as we can whenever we choose. I would gladly be your friend. Online friends are every bit as legitimate as "in-person" friends, and online friends can't give you covid, haha. Please feel free to message me whenever you like, because I'd love to be your friend. You are interesting and insightful, and no matter what others have done to you, that isn't diminished.   &#x200B;  EVERYTHING you feel is valid, and important, and worthy of discussion. That is so important to believe for yourself. I'm happy to hear you have a place to live with a friend and your mom.   I don't think you should believe you "pissed away" this year. There is a deadly pandemic and its at the all time high right now, you're allowed to stay home and stay safe. There is no shame in that, honestly it protects other people and is admirable. I left my job in March and have stayed home since, and at times I feel useless and worthless because I'm not saving money, but then I remember my life is more important. I'm 25, so almost exactly your age, but I'm afraid of dying of the pandemic. So I stay home, and I also do it to protect others, and I remember that's more important. So it's not pissing the year away, think of it as noble and smart to stay home and do freelance work when you can.   As far as advice, I think waiting out the pandemic before trying to work is safest, but, I think you should use this time to work on yourself. Work on teaching yourself that you are worthy, capable, lovable, strong. I suggest getting into yoga. It's 100% free on youtube, Yoga with Adriene is the best one. I swear to you, this will help your mental health, it did mine for sure, and its free with no equipment needed. Just head to youtube. You can also look up free meditations, for deep healing and trauma, and it could help you rewire some things. Talking to people online and making online friends is really helpful too, to not feel alone.  I don't know what else to say, except that I genuinely believe in you, and I want you to know that all of these things you've been through have NEVER been your fault. Asking for cookies as a kid is something every child has the right to do and your dad being awful is your DAD'S fault and his fault ALONE. You are a capable and important human with every right to be happy and thriving, and I wish you the best. Again, please feel free to talk to me any time at all. [end]
[start] Well, I don't have tips, but I definitely can say something.  Your pain is very real, and I'll be damned if I don't know what it means to carry the wounds of the past with you, even if you don't want to. It's strange, like some sort of shadow that constantly robs you of the light you should be getting in your life.  However, there's a pretty good circumstance in all this. The past is, luckily, your past, and you're still here. You've gone through it. I'm not saying it's not going to suck, but you'll come across some oportunities to get closer to the life you desire eventually. Have patience, keep a cool head and keep track of your feelings (making a journal would be actually really nice). It seems like you've acknowledged your situation is bad, but not insurmontable. You're gonna have to make some pretty smart and complicated moves if you want to get your ID, driver's license and whatever back.  You've got a hard situation, there's no use denying it. You've still got a story to write, and it's out there. I don't know you, you don't know me, but I want you to know that you're stronger than you think. Always.  Keep it up. [end]
[TITLE] I started getting that sad lonely feeling after walking through the park listening to a podcast about time, and as I was walking up to my apartment I remembered that my kittens were inside waiting to see me and I seriously can’t even describe how comforting that feeling is [TITLE]

[TITLE] What career should I choose??? [TITLE]

[TITLE] Im losing interest in making music. Help [TITLE]
[start] No offense, but your dad sounds like an asshole! It sucks that he's making you feel this way, if you want we can dm about it and I can listen to some of your music and tell you what I think (I'm also a musician so we could even try to work together on a song).   Dont let somebody ruin your passions with their opinions, no matter what you're making there's an audience for it somewhere; and the fact that he hasn't listened to any  of your music definitely makes it feel like he just doesnt want you to pursue career in arts. A lot of parents are like that, they want their kids to be doctors or lawyers because it's a reliable job that pays well, but trust me, following your passions is much more worth your time. [end]
[TITLE] Go to therapy? I'd love to, but my parents don't pay all my bills. [TITLE]
[start] Some therapist work on a sliding scale. Meaning if you dont make a lot of money, you'll pay less.    I've only had one therapist, and I paid $35 each session. He didn't have some fancy building or anything, he had an office in a church. Still worked for my needs though.    I feel like therapy *is* about developing new/better habits, its not only venting. At least, not for me.    But I do agree, mental health services aren't cheap and it sucks, but that's just the world we live in. [end]
[TITLE] I'm underweight and have only myself to blame [TITLE]
[start] It’s hard to hear but don’t think about now.   It sounds cliche but you gotta do what will make your FUTURE self happy.     You ever hold off on something and in the future you tell yourself: “damn if I would of did it before, I would feel good this exact moment.”   Don’t let it be that way. Fight through and do what you gotta do now because boy I tell ya, the future isn’t as far as you think   If you wanna work on your body and you’re feeling discouraged, just do it!  Now for my experience:  Me and my 3 year GF seperated a few months back and I was down and depressed, no confidence whatsoever.   But guess what? I didn’t force myself to do anything. I took inspired action. So I sat on my ass playing PS4 eating all day telling myself “I’ll start running soon, I’ll start losing weight soon, I’ll start to work out soon” eventually I had enough of looking in the mirror wishing my body was the way it was once when I was more active. So I finally did it and I’m telling you, if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be able to give you this advice right now.    Just do it!  Let me know if there’s anything else you’re worried about   Edit: so basically, doesn’t mean just get up and change your life in an instant. Set an intention and make it strong enough that you know soon you’ll take action. Relax however long but don’t procrastinate. Just know that soon you’re going to be working on it and it’ll be natural very soon [end]
[TITLE] I[26F] can't convince myself to move out even though I know it will improve my mental health [TITLE]
[start] To quote shia labeouf, "Just do it!" You don't need any convincing, you already know it's for the best. You need to just do it.   Look, my mom has schitzophrenia ok? I lived with mentally unstable parents until I was 15, when my brother put me in a foster home. I didn't wanna move, but when I actually did it it was for the best, and now I don't even wanna contact my parents.  That's the thing. You're in a type of comfort zone, and you don't wanna get out of it- but if you're anything like me, you'd know doing stuff out of your comfort zone often yields good results.   So just do it. Do it now, whether you like to or not. Stand up for yourself. You'll be convinced that it's the best choice once it's done. [end]
[start] Yeah just move out and keep them at an arm's lenght.  You wont help anyone if you get mentally screwed. [end]
[start] Hey, I know its a big step. But you've already decided why moving out is the best step, now all you have to figure out what is preventing you from taking the final step.  I can guarantee, none of those reasons are worth staying, from what you've described, and from my own experience, but just take a little bit of time to think about it and process it.  Next, just start planning the process of moving out, you don't have to make the final decision right now that you are going to move out, but just try plan everything out, like think about where you would stay and all that. And actually try apply for a lease and shit. Cause once that stuff comes through, it will start to become a reality and not just an idea, and then the decision ill be much easier to make.   Maybe even tell yourself you're only moving out for a year if that will be easier on you... then you will be in a much better state to think about things further.  While you are stuck at home though, maybe try some meditation. Also if you wanna talk about it more idm [end]

[TITLE] really lonely these days [TITLE]
[start] I am feeling exactly the same, i am 18 years old and i have always dreamt of Being finally mature. Unfortunately covid happened, i couldn't say Goodbye to my high school friends and i am slightly losing touch of them. I lost my girlfriend as well during this period. I had to celebrate my 18th birthday alone without my friends. I just wanna leave my home sometimes because i have the feeling that the most beautiful time of my life has been taken away. I am sorry, i don't really have advice but i commented anyway because i could relate to this. It's a hard time for all of us and it's not fair that covid Ruins everything for us but we have to stay safe. I am alsof definetely not a social person but all i want right now is to meet new People and have Fun with my friends and it is really frustrating. I hope you Will feel better and even though i don't know you, i believe in you [end]
[TITLE] Venting helps [TITLE]
[start] So my company got robbed early on when things were crazy, and as a fair result they reduced the amount of cash we have on hand to keep us safer. This means we haven't been able to break $100 bills because then we wouldn't have any change left, so we don't take them unless they are spending like $85+ (and safedrop them immediately), and some people are understanding about it. But we also get the assholes who say it's illegal (it's not) say we don't accept american currency (obviously not true) and that it's unamerican to refuse it. We also have SIGNS up explaining that we can't take $100s TEMPORARILY for our protection. All I've learned from this job is that most people are selfish, careless, and don't pay attention to their surroundings at all. I've gotten so much shit this year and it's just people being big babies over company policies. You must be a sad person with a sad life if you take your personal shit out on your local cashiers, who are nothing but nice and accomodating. It is depressing for me how many adults act like children when they are told "no". [end]
[start] Well that is awful, but they don’t get to decide if your happy or not, there’s rules and they need to follow them and if not then you can report them to your manager, I can already tell that your amazing, kind and very strong, use those to make your work day brighter 😊 and if allowed in your workspace let those people know that they don’t get to treat you like that [end]
[start] covid makes me more lonely than ever. I get really angry sometimes because it feels like i am wasting my life and my most beautiful years on this planet due to covid (i turned 18 a few months ago). I just finished highschool and i am losing contact with all of my friends. Also lost my girlfriend during this horrible period. Could not invite my friends over for my 18th birthday..Sometimes i just wanna run away and start a new life to still make something out of it, just start all over and leave the old life behind like it never happened..

[TITLE] Dog passed away last night at the vet. [TITLE]
[start] I'm so sorry for your loss. It sounds like you gave him an awesome, love-filled life though. [end]
[start] 13 is a long full life for a dog. It requires a caring owner for a dog to live this long. Hopefully you can take some comfort in knowing you gave him the best life a dog can have. [end]
[start] I am so sorry that this happened to you but you really shouldn’t blame yourself. You not taking him in earlier had no impact on the neglect of the vet in allowing your dogs feces to contact the surgical site. The site should have been covered preventing the infection and where he was being kept should have been taken better care of. You can not blame yourself for something that the vet clinic neglected. [end]
[start] Sorry for you loss. It is not your fault. He would never blame you. —I have sat thru the euthanization of several of our pet family members. And I’ve not been there for all. We can only do what we can do. What’s most important our the years we give, and that they give us. [end]
[start] I am so so sorry. I know your dog knew that you loved him. [end]
[start] I understand what your going thru I had a similar situation only with a 19 year old cat, now I have a dog for the past 6 years and love her to death, I will give her a little extra love just for you tonight, I am so sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] If it’s any consolation, he was probably very sleepy and did not feel you abandoned him. He drifted off peacefully. [end]
[start] I'll pat my cat for you tonight. 13 years is a long, happy life for the dog. You made the best decision you could. [end]
[start] You sound like a loving and caring owner. Your doggy was so fortunate to have you as an owner. [end]
[start] Sorry for your loss but it sounds like you really cared and gave it your best. It's easy to blame yourself and people do it all the time but it won't help and it's not true. Allow yourself some time to grieve though [end]
[start] You made the right decision with all the information you had at the time you thought this was best. If you would have did it the other way and he died you would feel guilty as well. Stop beating yourself up your precious dog would not want that. [end]
[start] I’m sorry for your loss. What I tell myself is that I gave them the best fighting chance possible. Snoopy doesn’t blame you.  On another note, that vet sounds negligent and uncaring. [end]

[TITLE] Do I need to stop saying actress? I was raised to say it, with no judgement intended as to the person’s talent. But now I hear people calling everyone actors. It doesn't come up much, but if I do say “actress” around someone who doesn’t, will they think I’m trying to be sexist or offensive? [TITLE]
[start] Stop letting language control your life. [end]
[start] Whuuuuuut I never heard of that. I'd also appreciate more info on this xD [end]
[start] As an acting student, we were taught to just call everyone actors if that helps aha [end]
[start]  We Thespians deride such poppycock. [end]
[start] Whaaaat [end]
[start] I'm an actor, this has been my experience working the business:  Many actors get offended at "actress" and think it is in the interest of equality to be called "actor", much like the change from "steward/stewardess" to "flight attendant".  I, personally, feel it's a little silly since sex is absolutely a determining factor in the casting of a role and I don't see why being female is inherently "bad"- but I understand that other's experiences are not my own and honor people's preferences, for gender pronouns as well.  If if doesn't cost me anything and doesn't hurt/disenfranchise others, why NOT respect someone's wishes regarding their personal and professional identity? [end]
[start] **Actor** is a **title**, just like **doctor.**  At one time people DID called females physicians, *Doctoress.* Doesn’t that *sound* weird to say by todays standards? This will be the first time some of you have heard of this but it was once the norm. (They also called math checkers **computers** and a female math checker a **computeress.**)  See the pattern? That’s why **actress** is being phased out since it’s a gender based title that needs no gender basis. Sure, it seems like an insult (did I just imply she looks like a dude?) But it’s correct by todays standards because we’re trying to get rid of all gender modification in work titles. [end]

[start] You might’ve just gotten lucky, imagine someone reads this and trusts their body(just like you) but they actually did have cancer and because of your comment they decide not to get it checked. They die from the cancer, whose fault is it. It would be all because you posted this thing. If you have the symptoms then you should go check it. It couldn’t hurt. After all, it’s better to be safe then be sorry later. Unless you’re in the us. You would need to sell your kidney just to get checked. [end]

[TITLE] I got rid of all of my social media (besides Reddit) and it has improved my mental health significantly [TITLE]
[start] Same here! I originally did it to escape the nonstop election drama but have decided to extend the hiatus. Much more peaceful. [end]
[start] I totally agree. I phased out all my other platforms. Reddit has to be next for me. [end]
[start] I block almost everyone from my newsfeed on Facebook... all I see are guitars,  cats, bands I like and other stuff that makes me happy... it's less about deleting social media,  and more about only following things I enjoy. [end]
[start] I deleted mine over a year ago because I found it was distracting me from uni homework but jeez it actually made me such a happier person too. At first I figured it was because I was getting my stuff done and not wasting my time (and not feeling procrastination guilt).  I found that overtime I would log in and see people I knew hanging out and tagging each other in things and doing fun activities and it’d make me a little sad. I felt like I was missing out a lot. However.... I only felt sad when I was on social media... so the fix to that is obviously just not going on it!  I have more time to do things, I’m not sad about missing out, I appreciate my friends more when I’m actually with them rather than posting about them, and mainly.. I can do my own thing without comparing myself to others! I recommend it to everyone but most people think it’s crazy haha [end]
[start] Me too! It would get me down when my online friends wouldn’t tag or mention me in posts/tweets etc... I feel much better without social media. [end]
[start] I’m working on this. So far I’ve been deleting apps from my phone so I’m not constantly checking them, but the next step is to delete Facebook and Instagram. Maybe Snapchat too. I’m tired of it. It’s too mentally draining. [end]
[start] I don't know you but I'm very happy for you! I think this is a wonderful thing. I got rid of Tumblr and Facebook last summer and have never regretted it. [end]
[start] I love Reddit! It’s enough just on its own! The kindness of strangers really moves me. So happy to see others feel the same. [end]
[start] I did the same thing several years ago and never looked back! Bravo for you! [end]
[start] interesting. unfortunately I feel I can't quite FB as that is where all my family are (lots of cousins in another country). I don't know how I would stay in contact with them without it.  has anyone got any successful mindfulness/self-help techniques for improving mental health while still staying on social media? [end]
[start] I took FB off my phone a few weeks ago. Feels great! But know that they will start to text you to guilt you back in if you gave a phone number for authentication. [end]

[TITLE] Truly falling for my friends husband. [TITLE]
[start] You've been granted a great trust. People that break it end up miserably , or on the Maury show.   Dont even think about backstabbing. You cant just fuck people that you got a crush on.   You need some people to restrain on, to remember how much you've achieved.  Ignore the patterns you see.  And dont drink together untill you're got it right. [end]
[start] It's easy, find a way to stop thinking like that or you're going to fuck things up. [end]
[start] Yes I can understand that you have to wonder whether your friend as a motive in mind by sending her husband over so often to help you??   Are you always alone at home when he is there to help you?    Is your husband aware of his frequent visits to help you out?    Is your husband aware of your desire to want to have sex with him. What does he think about that.   What is you were to wear something sexy for when he arrives. Has he ever indicated in anyway that he might be interested in more with you.   Certainly be cautious and ensure all parties are on side should anything ever progress. And remember there are increased risks of things going wrong should you actually have sex with him.

[start] Never date guys that got no job baby. How can they be supporting you, if you loose your job?   Dont be ashamed, love life is always awkward and crazy .  We all did embarrasing stuff.  Trust me.   Just move on and take care of your body, mind, soul.   Best of luck. [end]
[start] I really think you should go for a counseling or some therapy. There are things to discuss on about your mindset, your train of thoughts etc. Cheating hurts and would leave you a sense of betrayal yes but you have the power to overcome the sense of humiliation by changing your mindset. Right now, its good that you are venting out but in my opinion, those points are worth to discuss on. To help you grow and see the bigger picture.   Don't put so much pressure on yourself, it was a mistake but identify them and learn from them. Don't feel like you are dumb for those mistakes and do nothing about it. Embrace those mistakes and be a stronger self. Find help around you so that you won't be overcome by the anger and humiliation.   It is indeed scary to trust someone and let them inside after a betrayal but don't let this be a reason to push everyone away and isolate yourself. Its easier said than done, true but you have a life ahead of you yeah? [end]

[TITLE] How to get rid of mental blocks other people put on you? [TITLE]
[start] In my country, one of the National college exams task was:   You get the poem (of a nobel prize author) and you gotta read it and write down the answer for "What was the author's mindset and meaning for creating that poem?"   Then, the nobel prize lady who created that very poem, took the exam annonymously and wrote down what was her real meaning.  She got rated only 60% for the answer !!!! That was her own shit !!!!   So a random teacher/examinator "knew better" than the original creator , about the meaning of that poem LOOOL   Moral of the story: Some examinators dont know shit. So dont let their judgement affect you. Because as you see, they're not almighty all knowing gods.  I hope you understood that bizzare story. [end]

[start] If you think you did good last time, why wouldnt she say no?  Im proud of you to take a girl for an actual activity, instead of a boring date in a restaurant where you gotta pretend who youre not.  Just mind that times are gettin tough now, people are scared and misfortunes happen. If she says no, dont cross it yet. Try again another time.

[start] Well, I love you because you’re human.    There!    Now it’s even and you can go on. [end]
[start] Screw that person. If you write a list of people you care about, I guarantee you their name won't be on it. So screw what they think. As long as what you do doesn't hurt others, or yourself, do you. So what if you cried on a live stream? Just means you feel human emotion! I truly hope tomorrow is a better day for you. [end]
[TITLE] Damn thing [TITLE]
[start] Yes, most of the rest of the world hardly cares about you. And our lives are a constant daily grind and struggle to keep warm, dry, and fed. A struggle we will all eventually lose, betrayed by our own biology and DNA. Yet there are moments of great joy and inspiration. Challenges you will overcome, children you may raise, wonderful discoveries mankind will make. These make it worth sticking around for. And there are people who need your help. You may not have even met them yet. But they will be happy you were here for them.   So stick around and lend a hand. [end]

[start] No, the technology and social media turns people into idiots equally around the world.  Its more about the culture itself and how people are raised.  In Asia if the girl is over 25 and still not married, she's considered pathetic.  In the West, women think its a "strenght and female power"  Yeah, power of sucking random dicks at the disco.. [end]

[TITLE] insecurity towards black people [TITLE]
[start] I'm sorry but you can't blame you insecurity on a group of people. Yeah it's good you're analyzing your feelings. Black people have been victims of a horrible racist system. Please understand that. I recommend talking with a therapist so he/she can help guide you. [end]
[start] It takes a lot to acknowledge your insecurity, so respect to that. It may help to have this conversation with a therapist especially if you ever have the urge to act on those insecurities.   With that said; media (social/tv/web adverts) can be driven by the demographic where you live so that would be one explanation to why you may see specific ads or programming. Another thing that I learned as a Latino in high school in New England and in the South for a year is that the culture is so different depending on what part of the US you live in, these differences have been present since pre-Civil War times.

[TITLE] I cut off a friend to distance myself from a person who hurt me [TITLE]
[TITLE] Made myself sad, again. (advice pls) [TITLE]
[start] Kinda going through this rn, i haven’t had a crush in over a year till I met this coworker who happened to have a lot of mutual friends with me. She was very attractive but I found out she had a boyfriend so I just kept talking as friends. But months passed now and we became great friends but I developed such a huge crush on her that she’s on my mind 24/7 and I can’t do anything about it since she’s in a relationship. Things I have been doing to not keep her on my mind are hanging out more with my friends , try to stay occupied throughout the day, I started a new Netflix show which passes time good. And I guess the best would be to find other girls to talk to.   If you’re crushing on someone, and start to become attached and they’re single, don’t be shy to ask them out/ get to know them more and maybe you’ll find yourself in a relationship. [end]
[start] I assume you're younger? Maybe in high school? If so then that's pretty normal. I used to get crushes on people I hardly even knew or talked to. There's really no way to deal with these besides trying to talk to the crush or making a new crush with someone more accessible to you.  If you're not younger and still get these big crushes, that's ok too! Personally I found it much easier to connect with people when I wasn't in high school anymore. For example you have a crush on someone from work or college classes, it will be easy to talk to them because you already have a common ground to get a conversation started. Most people love to talk about themselves so if you get em talking just keep elaborating with your questions. [end]
[start] I’m also going through this shit too, you’re not alone. [end]
[TITLE] how do people accept themselves [TITLE]
[start] self image is one of the hardest part of self love. happiness comes from within, and within yourself one is ones own worst critic. have conversations with your bf, make a plan, stick to it, and gradually (no cheat diet) obtain your goals (achieve I mean achieve your goals). [end]
[start] there is the philosophy of selflessness that i think most people ignore. i am not myself convinced of its virtues but it is at least something to consider.   the philosophy of selflessness says that you should neither hate yourself or esteem yourself but you should instead give no thought to yourself beyond your basic needs like food, water, and shelter. beyond those basic needs, instead of giving more thought to yourself, you should find ways to be valuable to your community.  jordan peterson has some great lectures and writings on this idea. [end]
[start] Its an evolution.   If you feel like loosing weight, you gotta loose it.   Its about eliminating your complexes.    Yep. It cost money, hard work, and eating the food you hate.  Do you think, that beautiful people that takes care of themselves - wouldnt want to just sit and eat a hamburger and pizza and mcdonalds and drink shitty sugar drinks and stay on the couch all day?  Ofcourse we would love to! But thats the price!  The sooner you start, the sooner you gonna enjoy the new you. Trust me. Thats the best feeling of the world.  Start from eating only 80% of the portions, drink only water, dont eat 3 hours before bed, eat a breakfast early, eat apples and natural yogurt for 2 weeks (yogurt burns 81% of belly fat) [end]
[TITLE] Is it odd to feel a little sad on your birthday? [TITLE]
[start] Wait till you hit 23 lol. Jokes aside, it’s super common! I think it comes from building up this expectation to have the best day of the year; nothing’s supposed to go wrong. You’re young though, just spend the day doing whatever makes you happy with whoever makes you happy. Happy birthday! [end]
[start] Growing up is complicated. The older you get, the more bittersweet there is in the sweet but it’s not bad or wrong to feel what you feel. You still have a lot of joy and excitement waiting for you. [end]
[start] Humans are the only ones who mark the day they were born and count how many years “old” they are.  I know a lot of young people who are in their 60’s and a lot of old people who are in their 30’s.  Age is really in our minds and attitudes.  Our dogs are happy just to be.  Let’s be glad to just be, regardless of how many days we’ve been (human) being.  Happy Birthday, young one! [end]
[start] No , i say it’s just normal. Maybe feelings of passive aggressive guilt from who knows. Lol but deadass. I know what your feeling maybe? On my 17th it didn’t feel hype like my 16th but weird like I was kinda shocked I made it to 17 but 🤷🏾‍♂️. I prayed a little and ever since life has been coming together slowly but with progress I’m only 23 tho. Oh and problems , lots and lots of problems lol. A lot of us didn’t get to see 17. I’m grateful. Happy Birthday and may you have many more ! [end]
[start] Ive felt a little sad on every birthday since I was about 13. I don't know, but every year was just another time to lament my birthday. Its maybe because as a family we started to experience a lot of death when I was younger. Uncles, aunts, and general greif. Also since then ive lost my father and grandmother. Im 23 now, and my mother is approaching her 70s. Im usually not out with friends either because my b-day falls in the beginning of february in the midwest. No one is doing anything on those days. Unless there's an entourage of people, or something that keeps you close with people who actually remember your birthday. I just never saw the need in caring too much about it. Yet when the day falls, I end up reminiscing, and that will usually bring us back to recanting our life up to that point... which can bring about many feelings, sometimes sadness. [end]
[start] You're just about at the end of the fun ones. Eventually birthdays just become oldness reminders. [end]
[start] Depends on the reason.  Soon I will feel sad, firstly because   1. I will be one year closer to 40 2. I will be alone 3. After Corona I will only have my parents and only two friends to celebrate with 4. I try to not drink alcohol for the rest of the year, so I will not even be able to artificially lift my mood.  Dude, your fine :) [end]
[start] Happy bday!! [end]
[start] I always end up feeling a least a little sad every birthday. I think for me at least I have these high expectations that I’ll have an amazing fantastic day. It’s my birthday so everything should be fun fun fun. Then the day comes and it’s a pretty much average day with just a tad bit more excitement. My expectations were too high, so I inevitably was let down and disappointed with the actual day. That’s what I think always wrecks my birthday [end]
[start] The older ive gotten the more I’ve realized my birthday is just about being around people I love. It used to stress me out thinking about making plans, having a big party, etc. would much rather go on a hike w my friends and get a beer afterwards.   Happy birthday! [end]
[start] My birthdays are always sad days. They were fun up until my 12th or so, but after that the only fun one was 21. I take my birthdays off from work and my boss jokes that I wanna have a lil party with presents and I’m like “no dude I just need that day to be depressed af” [end]
[start] Hey y'all, I really appreciate the birthday wishes and inputs! I definitely agree that birthdays can be a little sad because of our high expectations for them to be spectacular. As we get older, the "birthday magic" just seems to wear off. My previous birthdays were more fun, though they stopped being that way after I turned 15. I'm still a youngin' , so birthdays shouldn't be super depressing just yet, I agree. :)  I'll find some way for them to be enjoyable. I'll be 18 next year, maybe that'll be a decent one. Hopefully, it isn't ruined by covid. [end]
[start] I usually feel the same indifference but that’s probably because I don’t do much special for my birthday. Maybe I you celebrate it more it might be more fun [end]

[start] What's the best way to get comment karma so I can participate in reddits? [end]
[start] Throughout the years of being a Reddit user I’ve found 2 methods work best.   1. Do what you did right now but asking for upvotes. Ex. “Can someone help me get upvotes? Need posting karma to make a post” I’ve found playing dumb usually leads to less upvotes than the example but still a significant amount   2. Write a sob story [end]

[start] Well, kinda of giving off incel vibes, but if this is what motivates you, go out there and do it! [end]
[start] Hey bud, sounds like you are having a rough time and I’m sorry for that. If you want some community that’s actually healthy and wise (a tribe of older men if you will) go over to r/menslib [end]
[start] This post was already weird from the start but one of your comments really takes the cake   “It's just one of those evil feelings that build up when you apparently look half decent, and still have been single your entire life. I know I'm 19, so I'm still "young", but still 😈”  Maybe your p e r s o n a l i t y is the problem. The whole idea that women should automatically have dated you by now because you “apparently look half decent” as if that’s some fucking qualification, is so weird and entitled. It’s pretty easy to gather from your post and comments that you’re on the road to being an incel. Careful bud it’s a slippery slope. [end]
[start] Finally, a decent post on this website! :)  Don't listen to anyone else. What you want to do isn't "wrong". You have every right to say no to anyone who asks you out. I hope you reach your goal. [end]

[TITLE] I want to share something a friend posted that helps clarify what's going on in the US right now. The protests are not *just* about one isolated incident. This is about race. The issue goes far deeper than that and it can't be explained away that easily. [TITLE]
[start] Can you post references for stats and facts? [end]
[start] America has like the most militarized police in the world and the largest prison population. Even the racist and totalitarian Russian cops kill less people (mostly torture suspects to death during the detention, so victims will admit to crimes). Compared to America, actual African countries don't have huge budgets and a lot of police officers, yet still manage to have far less criminals. America is literally worse than the poor African countries when it comes to the society, competing only with Russia. The superpower is not super safe, no matter the amount of guns people buy each day. [end]
[start] The words "black lives matter" offend me because they are condescending and patronizing. They make it seem as if I am supposed to not already believe this. I am tired of being assumed to be a racist because I am white. As a result, I actually understand why black people would be angry that people assume they're dangerous because they're black.  White privilege does not exist. Black disadvantage does. If people keep trying to push shame and guilt onto white people, more people who used to not be racist, are going to become it, and there will be even more chaos. I won't be one of them, because I'm not a dumbass - but there are a lot of dumbasses in this country.  Also, the fact that everyone whines about anti-black racism while COMMITTING anti-white racism (and also, while ignoring the terrible oppressions occurring in countries other than America which are even worse than black people experience here - such as the occupation of Palestine by Israel), pisses me off. You can  decry the systemic racism in a system without blaming an entire race for it. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Yeah but it’s easier for the media to say “race war lul” instead of doing anything constructive, and people eat that shit up. [end]
[start] This shouldn't even be just about race! Don't get me wrong with black people only taking up 12% of the entire US population but accounting for as much as 30 to 50% of certain prison populations they are definitely disproportionately affected.  However it's our entire fucking system. Have you ever heard of the Tulsa massacre in Oklahoma. A very successful black town was pretty much destroyed because white people couldn't stand black people having success. Literally for Generations we have kept black people poor. And because of this and because of racism a lot of our laws were made to destroy anyone who was poor because they were the minority they were the people that you wanted to get rid of. We have quotes from presidents who have purposefully put in laws to teardown minority communities and make them into slaves in a prison house.  Here's the issue when 98% of all charges and employee agreements as a general average from the studies and statistics posted out. Certain local areas you can find some as low as 90% of all charges and in a plea agreement. Why?  Why would any innocent person sign a guilty paper?  Because as soon as you are charged with something in the United States before you even seen the judge you show up as if you are convicted. It's common practice for a district attorney to up your charges to felonies as soon as they hit their desk however they can. Before they have even seen you. You can get fired from your job because of that. You can be denied any reasonable employment because of that. And the district attorney can drag on the preliminary rounds for years until you just want to sign a guilty plea.  You can set in the jailhouse during the entire time these preliminary rounds are going on. And in my area if you decide to sit in the jailhouse so that way you can get a lawyer assigned to you because they won't if you're not sitting in the jailhouse. The state literally charges you 75 to $110 a day for maintaining you in the jailhouse. Let's say your bail was set to 3000. Your mother could pay a bondsman about 300 to 350 to go and bail you out. Oh but if she does that you're considered able to afford an attorney. It doesn't go off with pay stubs it doesn't go off of W-2s. It doesn't go off of anything else any other government programs such as food stamps energy assistance free lunches for your children or even college education. All of those government programs actually take pay stubs W-2 tax returns Etc. Not if you want a lawyer!  The laws are made to keep people down. They're made to make you pay. It's your guilty until you pay for innocent. You know all the politicians who have been noted for sexual issues a lot of the pedophile if she's were people had even been convicted but just go to another country for a few years and then come back and still work in Hollywood with children! How does this happen with their backgrounds it's because they paid it off!  Meanwhile a lawyer can cost 2 to $300 an hour. And a situation with the lawyer I had to get she wrote herself down as my lawyer before I had signed anything or done anything. No other lawyer would take me because in the documents and the county she was my lawyer. She wouldn't progress my case until I had paid for a full size thousand dollars. So the district attorney kept me in the preliminary rounds and kept kicking it down month by month. I still had to show up to the courthouse every single month just for them to stay after me waiting in line for hours with a bunch of other people because you can't show up whenever you have to show up at 9 a.m. and they might get to you by 2 p.m.  They just tell you come back next month we haven't done anything. Meanwhile they charge you for every single court date they have which they have to have every month. It's $80 each court date. Him down at the top so you can report this to your attorney general of your state but they're not going to do anything. Oh when you can file The Paupers affidavit to try to get a lawyer but that's determined by a judge. And they won't give you one! I have seen homeless people who are still sitting in the jailhouse denied lawyer! Merely because they didn't call the right ones when there's a list of 20 lawyer and they called 10 of them. But apparently not the right ones. This is a list that is posted in the jailhouse. Along with bondsman that are posted in the jailhouse.  Imagine going through all this all the wild charges of felony show up on your background you've lost your job but yet you're seeing is able to afford an attorney. This can go on for years! There's this one story of a man who killed himself because he was accused as a child of stealing a backpack and grew up in jail before they finally just dismissed all his charges because there wasn't enough evidence or anything. He had been so mentally damaged by the way they treated him he ended up killing himself a few years later. His family noticed that he never recovered socially.  But when we have had politicians and presidents literally Target minorities and make laws that would disproportionately affect minorities and how generally the rich people are white and can pay Off Their fines and pay for their innocence that is what this issue is about. But no one's fighting the lawyers or the judges.  No let's all just blame the cops and it's the individual cops problem not the states problem because multiple cops have killed people with these restraining procedures. But no let's only focus on these three cops that killed this one man and not focus on reforming the entire Justice System changing the way our judges lawyer's and everything work Arbonne system are jailhouse system and our police all at once. No let's just defund the police. If we do that we're just going to leave a lot of the private stores to only take care of their problem with their security forces and their police forces and then we won't have a police force to ever investigate them. As corrupt as our police force is it's because of a lot of the other system issues.  Our justice system needs to be burned completely and redone!  Oh also it's a really interesting fact that the pharmaceutical companies and medical companies in the United States have spent more than NASA has just for a lobbying to keep their prices high and hidden and everything else. This is why it cost us 17% of our GDP just to take care of the old people in our country. Also that and we see fast food as an essential service but not certain Medical Services. What a fucking piece of work. I can't wait till I'm dead or out of this country [end]
[start] These people are kind of bringing it on themselves though. They grow up being told that they are special and deserve everything, and whenever they don’t get what they want they call it racist. Many deal drugs for extra cash, then call it racist when they get pulled up and arrested. I’m not saying that white people are better, I’m saying that people should learn that illegal actions over several decades are *going* to start stereotypes about a certain type of person. Nobody is special, and *nobody* deserves anything. [end]

[start] This is probably the scariest post ive read this entire year.   Why? Well due to monetary and political reasons, you can now with the help of technology manipulate/brainwash human beings into believing something false to be facts by creating fake “facts”.   We are sadly moving in the same direction as with the Salem witch trials. Where their excuse was ignorance and strong belief, ours is too much technology/information mixed with planted beliefs.   ....  After spending day in and out for the last 25 years digging into the subjects mentioned in the post and working closely with it. I will have to say that this entire post only contains   - A personal opinion. - Fabricated numbers. [end]
[start] Are we going to get any sources for the actual claims here? The only one of these that I have seen sourced elsewhere is the 1/1000 vs 39/100,000.   Also, why not present that as 100/100,000 vs 39/100,000? I think everyone is in agreeance that there is a racism problem within the US police force; we dont need to undermine the point by trying to make stats seem more incredible than they already are. [end]
[start] When you present an opinion and claim that its backed by facts, you have to source these facts from a trustworthy source. Why should I have to search for information when you're the one trying to convince me that colored people are getting discriminated against?  So far I haven't been able to find any documents that had any trustworthy documentation or refrences but it might be me idk.  Anyways while I definitely believe that there is racism in the states(I know because I lived in the states for 12 years before moving back to Korea), some of these facts sound ridiculous.  "White families hold 90% of the national wealth, black families hold 2.6%" - I couldn't find any source. But it is plausible considering only 13.4% of the population are colored folks. But you have understand it's only been 52 years since Mr.King died. You might think that it's a long time, but for a few centuries colored people were treated as sub-human by the majority of non-colored people and many of the caucausian younger generation at that time has grown to be an old man ingrained with those very same values. Considering that the majority of Americans are caucasian, you can easily predict the result of what would happen.  I absolutely think that there are things that have to be solved within society in the states but these changes simply can't happen in a short amount of time. There's a national crisis in the US at the moment and while I respect your noble cause, it's detrimental to the economy and stability of the country. That's my opinion but each to their own.  P.S y'all at the states should seriously impeach pancake face at the whitehouse. While Obama wasn't the best president, he still put the country and it's citizens as top priority. Meanwhile, the current president tear gasses his own citizens to take a picture of him holding a bible upsides down rofl [end]
[start] It's also historically aswell.  I'm a white person ok, I live in the UK - so I am privileged (but skint), but I have white privilege.  I have suffered from discrimination and stigma as have a mental health diagnosis of bipolar.  But that is only when people find out, and that is only when I'm in a situation where people are judgemental, so that is not, say walking into a shop, walking into a pub.  I only experience that, from a small minority of people, when I chose to tell them, and most nowadays (perhaps I'm better at choosing who I tell now) people have become more understanding of it.  &#x200B;  So my discrimination I have experienced, was only temperamental - I struggle to find employment (I get the interview, do well in some (most I do appalling), but they always find a reason not to hire me.  And because of the types of jobs I apply for, I have to disclose to them, but it's not required for me to disclose until I get the job offer, but cos I'm sick of getting the offer, and then they turn it down, I now put it on the application form in the supporting info bit such as 'I will tell you now rather than later, I have a mental health diagnosis.'  Because I'm sick of going through all the process, which for me, takes a lot of effort and stress, to be turned down at the last minute.   So I tell them straight up if I can, then I know I've got a better chance, and I know then it's something I've done wrong in the interview.  So I suffer discrimination that way.  &#x200B;  So if I imagine, and I cannot ever really understand, unless I was actually a black person, and a black person reading this might very well say, no it was nothing like that, because you don't really know until you have experienced it for yourself.  &#x200B;  But can you imagine being born, and then (even at 6mths old babies have the ability to smile back at you if you smile at them), that young ok - coming out of the safety of your family home, sitting in a pushchair, going to the shops.  Where a lot of people you see, strangers are not smiling at you.  And it happens and happens again, throughout your childhood, not just once a week, over and over again, whenever you go anywhere at school, or anywhere where their is white people,  How do you think that might be reinforced to a child?  That you are inferior.  Their parents might try to explain to a child or reinforce that they are special and that black is beautiful, but a young child might not fully understand.  And they just understand, that they are getting treated differently from white kids.  They see negative looks in people's eyes, when adults, and perhaps other children, look at them, and it's in their awareness.  But then on top of that - there is the knowledge, when they get a bit older, to understand how the colonists infiltrated Africa, and enforced their white supremacy onto black people.  Take South Africa for example, the apartheid, black people had all their rights removed.  They were not allowed to have insurance, they were not allowed to own their homes, they had to rent off a white landlord, they were only allowed to be slaves, for white people.  They had to live separately from white people.  And even when apartheid ended, it created even more problems as there were no jobs for them when slavery ended.  Not only that, they were denied an education, because white people decided to deliberately give kids, that would be at high school age at this point, having to recite the 2 times table.  Because white people didn't want them to become educated because they wanted to reinforce onto them that they are slaves.  But children grow up believing that they are inferior.  Yes their parents might be doing the opposite, but when the leaders of your country, and the white people that lived their was reinforcing it constantly, people actually believe that they are inferior as it has been drilled into them since the day they were born.  There parents might have still continued to believe they were inferior to white people.  Then white people forced Christianity onto them, white missionaries.  They were led to believe that Jesus was white with blue eyes, in Christianity Jesus is God, so they believed in God, believed in Jesus, and believed that God is white.  Reinforcing that , because of the colour of their skin they are inferior and that inferiority has come from God, because God is white with blue eyes.  &#x200B;  Then the slavery and the brutally that their slave owners gave to them, and I am no where close to what they might have experienced over and over again.  They would have been terrified of their slave owners no doubt.  They were nothing more than how we treat our pets, however, we love our pets and we don't make them work for us for us to get rich.  Then slavery got abolished.  The problems do not disappear overnight - the problems are present here today - and are no where near close to treating people with a little of bit of respect.  Trump comes to power, after their might have been a ray of hope when Obama came to power  - for a black person, can you imagine how amazing that must have felt to witness the first black president - and that's your black president in your country, who's intention wasn't to get involved in the Iraq war, which shadowed his time in office, his intention was to fight what he could for equality.  And he tried to do that with free health care for all.  Then Trump comes into power, people in the UK, white people were angry about that, but can you imagine listening to him and he's your president and you are black - can you imagine how that must feel.  I can feel angry at Trump, but I'm at a safe distance from him, in the UK, to not let it bother me too much.  So yeah, when black people see a white person, it reminds of them that we were the same colour as their oppressors.  And it's them that have to try really really hard each time, to keep themselves polite with us.  Because if it was me, I just couldn't do that I'd completely insane.  I could not cope with that level of anger they have suppress on a day to day basis when you look at how we have treated them for all this time.  &#x200B;  The Black Lives Matter is not due to one single event.  I don't understand why it's taken this long for them to start protesting, because what happened with George Floyd happens a lot in the US.  I didn't fully understand this until I read 'Just Mercy' by Bryan Stevenson a couple of years before.  I felt what happened to Eric Garner was even worse, because the trial went on for years, and the police got away with it and still work in the police force.  There has been loads of incidents similar to George Floyd - and I have only heard of  a small fraction of them,   Black people in America, are scared, on a day to day basis, that they might get shot down.  So that might be one of the reasons why it's taken so long for the pot to bubble over - out of fear perhaps.  I visited America just the once, and I felt scared, knowing people might be carrying guns.  Thinking all the time, be super polite, don't cause any bother, and I'm a white person.  I was terrified at customs in LA airport as that was the first time I'd ever seen a gun in real life (i'd only seen a gun on TV).  Trump goes on about the UK having a problem with stabbings.  Yes we have, but it's a small minority, and this small minority, the majority are kids, carrying knifes as they've got involved in smoking a bit of weed, feeling a bit scared as they've been introduced to other gangs that carry knifes.  Mostly the stabbings are within these gangs, the majority, so for me I feel safe to walk where I want without that worry.  If you live in a country when guns are just seen on tv, seeing a gun in real life, seeing someone carrying a gun in real life is terrifying for me.  In the US, that might not occur to mind because they are used them.  So yes, I'm glad I don't have to face what black people have to face, as I couldn't live day by day have to put on a lid on my rage that I feel.  And I have probably underestimated it, because I'll never ever really know how it feels and how it effects you because I have privilege, white privilege.  And I too, was led to believe, not from my mum, but from the media and how one of my school teachers treated the one black kid in my school, that black people are inferior.  For F\*\*k's sake - it's a skin colour due to different levels of pigmentation.  and knowing how ridiculous, the intolerance, of a different shade of skin makes us - and how dangerous and oppressive we have become.  I'm gonna stop here. [end]

[start] Disney will not allow a black character unless it is an animal?  This couldn’t possibly be because the majority of the US population has been Caucasian, could it?  Not saying Disney is not racist, because some of their depictions in their shows, but there are characters evolving now that are not exclusively Caucasian.  Maybe they were targeting a broad audience, without intending to marginalize a group.  Yes, there is room for growth, especially since we are in 2020, but to state they will not allow it without proof from Disney?  Far fetched. [end]

About half of those killed were white, and one quarter were black,  making the rate of deaths for black Americans (31 fatal shootings per  million) more than twice as high as the rate for white Americans (13  fatal shootings per million).[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-:1-82)[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-83) *The Washington Post* also counts 13 unarmed black Americans shot dead by police in 2019.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-84)    >   >A 2019 study by Cesario et al. published in [*Social Psychological and Personality Science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Psychological_and_Personality_Science)  found that after adjusting for crime, there was "no systematic evidence  of anti-black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of  unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of  harmless objects".[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-85)  However, a 2020 study by Ross et al. criticizes the data analysis used  in the Cesario et al. study. Using the same data set, Ross et al.  conclude that there is significant racial bias in police shooting cases  involving unarmed black suspects. This bias is not seen when suspects  were armed.[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-86)    >   >A study by Harvard economist Roland Fryer found that blacks and  Hispanics were 50% more likely to experience non-lethal force in police  interactions, but for officer-involved shootings there were "no racial  differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken  into account".[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-87)    >   >A study in [*PLOS One*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_One)  found "significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans  relative to unarmed white Americans" by police. The average bias measure  was that unarmed African Americans had 3.49 times the probability of  being shot compared to unarmed whites, although in some jurisdictions  the risk could be as much as 20 times higher. The study also found that  the documented racial bias in police shootings could not be explained by  differences in local crime rates.[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-88)    >   >A since retracted study in [*PNAS*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNAS)  claimed that black people were actually less likely than white people  to be killed by police, based off the death rates in police encounters.[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-89) A study published in the journal [*Nature*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)) that found such conclusions were erroneous due to [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox). The *Nature*  paper showed that it was true that white people were more likely to be  killed in a police encounter, overall black people were still being  discriminated against because they had far more interactions with the  police due to structural racism. The paper noted that black people have  far more interactions with the police per capita than white people, and  that black people tend to get stopped for more petty crimes or for no  crime at all. Conversely, white people tend to interact with police in  situations more rarely, and often in more serious crimes such as  shootings, where police are more likely to use force. Thus while it  appears that white people are killed at a higher rate, the datasets are  not comparable in such a simple fashion. The *Nature* paper also  backed up the findings of Ross and Fryer, and concluded that overall  rate of death was a much more useful statistic than the rate of death in  encounters.[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-90)[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#cite_note-91)   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_Lives\_Matter#Police\_use\_of\_excessive\_force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#Police_use_of_excessive_force) [end]

[start] Hi [end]
[start] Holy. Your right It’s not about a few things it’s about all the things listed in the post. Weird how come the news hasn’t coved the actual facts. That means the media and news is just feeding the issue and not giving the right facts also called fake news [end]
[start] Big city police are deployed in high numbers to low-income African American communities. Why? Because that’s where most of the crime is. That’s where it has been since the 1920s, and especially since the 1960s. Such deployments were far less common prior to the 1960s, when black communities were severely under-policed. The result was impunity for many black violent criminals and, in turn, an incentive for black men to engage in more violence as a self-defense mechanism. The late 1960s changed this pattern. As black-on-white crime rose, police departments came under mounting pressure to control crime, much of which occurred in or near minority neighborhoods where it victimized black residents. African American violent crime rates soared between the 1960s and the early 1990s. During that period, in big cities, arrests of African Americans for homicide, the most accurate measure of violent crime, accounted for 65 to 78 percent of all homicide arrests. This is an extraordinary figure when one considers that the nonwhite population of these cities ranged from only 20 percent to a bit over 35 percent. The situation today has improved considerably. African American crime rates, and United States crime rates generally, have fallen dramatically. For all persons of all age groups, the homicide death rate fell 34 percent from 1990 to 2016. For black males in the same time frame, the decline was 40 percent. While violent crime has fallen, it nevertheless remains disproportionally high in communities of color. The latest police data collected by the FBI indicates that blacks comprised 58 percent of all murder arrests and 40 percent of those apprehended for all violent crimes. This disproportional involvement of African Americans in violent crime turns out to be the most significant factor of all in explaining the use of force against blacks by police. It will be no surprise that violent criminals in the United States are commonly armed and dangerous. For assaults, for instance, 71 percent of arrested persons carried firearms. Among suspected murderers, 58 percent had guns, as did 42 percent of apprehended robbery suspects. This tally doesn’t include the knives or blunt instruments recovered from violent offenders, including over 48,000 cutting instruments possessed by those arrested for assault alone. Police, of course, are well aware of this situation. Charged with a duty to apprehend offenders, they are—and must be—prepared to use force. Confrontations, often armed confrontations, in these circumstances are inevitable. Such confrontations will frequently involve white police and black suspects. Whites are a declining proportion of police departments in the United States, but they’re still close to half the force in big-city departments where white males make up 44 percent of full-time sworn officers. The Chicago Study As it turns out, when it comes to the use of force, the race of the police officer may not be significant. A study of 270 police shootings in Chicago from 2006 to 2014 found that the demographics of the officers who fired their weapons matched the demographics of the police department. Whites were 51 percent of the shooters and 53 percent of the force; blacks were 23 percent of the shooters and 25 percent of the force. In other words, there is no evidence that white police were more likely to discharge their weapons or that African American officers were less likely. This is especially noteworthy given the demographics of the shooting victims: 5 percent were white, 14 percent Hispanic, and an eye-popping 80 percent were black. Equally significant is the reason for the confrontation. In the overwhelming majority of cases (77 percent), the police were reactive, not proactive. They were responding, in the typical scenario, to a call about a violent crime. In the proactive situation (23 percent of the shootings), the officer initiated the contact, e.g., stopped a suspicious person. [end]
[start] One word, Fascism. What you see today isn't a product of a single event, this has been going on for years, way before most of us were born, this system is a process, a process with a current goal that's set up to make us all dependent on a government, to demoralize us and rid us of knowledge and understanding, fill our minds with rubbish and what they've done is create a human breed that's disconnected from reality, people are in denial and they will be untill a tragic event happens in their lives. Both political parties have plenty of flaws but the same agenda, starts with demoralizing a nation, destabilizing and then a sending a crisis, after this crisis with a violent change in power comes the normalization stage. People know your history or be doomed to repeat it! We need a revolution, a radical change, such change doesn't come peacefully just look at the past! Thank you for sharing your post OP, reddit is probably our last source of useful information gathered from average people not big corp like Google and whatnot. A time is coming where people are rising, people who are NOT afraid of death, people who will take it upon themselves to fight, to raise other leaders and warriors, we must remain mentally strong, not let fear control our minds, thoughts, lives and relationships. We need to grow emotionally, people have become so hurt and offended that a single look at someone taken the wrong way can result in death! Why? Who is responsible? ALL OF US JUST AS MUCH AS THOSE WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT AND SERVE. So many people don't know the constitution and it's role, the same people don't care, yet only start to care when they're affected somehow, and that's usually too late. Ideological subversion is a legitimate process and this isn't just happening in our country this is a global event and it seems as if those NWO conspiracies are starting to make sense. I still have hope because it's hard to accept that at the root of humanity there is so much evil and hatred. [end]

[start] That’s awesome! Congratulations! You should be so proud of yourself that’s a great accomplishment! [end]
[start] Congrats! We care!!! [end]
[start] This is no small feat. Excellent job\~! [end]
[start] i am both happy and jealous [end]
[start] I totally care! Excellent work. Rock on. [end]
[start] That is super cool! Congratulations. You worked hard and got good grades, and in fact, you got the best grades. hell yeah [end]
[start] Honestly congrats this is something almost no one can do and you proved you can, keep going on the path you are goin :) [end]
[start] That’s super impressive. 293 people couldn’t do as well as you. Good work. Next goal, find more positive support system. Someone should be there to pat your back. [end]
[start] You’re goated keep going at it! [end]
[start] That is a huge and meaningful accomplishment--congratulations! [end]
[start] Outstanding! Seriously, this is a terrible time, so a hearty well done! Any advice to parents struggling with their kids and remote learning? (serious question) Also I bet #2 in class cares, but who ever they are, they're crushing it just like you!!! Be proud!!! You earned this. [end]
[start] Oh they care. They care they aren't at your place and won't tell you. This is an amazing achievement.  Don't take pressure to come first all the time. But I sure hope you always reach your goals and get your full potential all the time! [end]
[start] Congratulations! This is such an amazing accomplishment. Trust me, the people around you know how awesome it is, they’re probably not showing it because they wish they could do something just as great and they don’t think they can [end]
[start] I bet whoever got number 2 cares. [end]
[start] Start your resume with "Education: Ranked #1 of 294 in X grade". [end]
[start] Woot! Anyone who disrespects this achievement couldn’t achieve it. Pay them no mind. [end]
[start] I hope you will use your gifts for good. What are your plans for your future? [end]
[start] Let's fking gooooo!!! [end]
[start] Congratz, you should be happy, enjoy yourself for 1 month. Then stop looking at the report card, throw it away. As it and all the other praises in this thread is just a false sense of accomplishment after 1 month period. It will only achored you down.  Number 1 in 294 doesnt necessarily means you're smartest out of 293 students. It just means you stuck your face to books longer than the other 293. Now you know you can achieve number 1 in high school, you should set your goals higher and broader. Try tapping into aother non academics skills. Coding, white hat hacking, skateboarding, soccer, car repair, competitive gaming etc. Be good at other non academics skills, but set your goal top 10 in all of these skills. Number 1 in academics alone is shitty compared to top 10 in 5 skills. It'll preoare you better once you set in the real life & college. [end]
[start] Congrats bro. I failed math :( [end]
[start] I remember being top of my classes until I got rejected and started doing so awful, people think im an actual genuine idiot. [end]
[start] I was in a similar position, just a bit less competition. I was the best out of about 100 students and i was extremly happy about it. If i was speaking to others about it they didnt care or said i was bragging. But like for real, if you are the f\*\*\*ing best out of so many you should be proud  and dont care about the haters!  Keep up the good work!! [end]
[start] One thing you’ll learn is people, for the most part, will only care about things that benefit them. Unless they are close friends of yours you can’t expect people to be happy for you. Unfortunately [end]
[start] Bruhhhh I’m so proud of you!!! Congrats! 😊😊 [end]
[start] Congratulations!!!! I am soo happy for you Honestly I am one those too for whom it became so obvious that it wasn't a thing to congratulate on and it's soo hard to have that feeling. So I am really really happy and wish you all the luck for your future. [end]
[start] You rock, congratulations! [end]
[start] Congratulations bro [end]
[start] Way to go, yes, that is a really big deal.  Congratulations! [end]
[start] Congratulations OP! Hard work always pays off, super happy for you ❤️❤️ [end]
[start] Great job! As of now, I think I am last in my class. [end]
[start] As the unintentional slacker, I’d kill for such an achievement. Don’t break yourself over grades, but great job that is an amazing thing [end]
[start] nice now try to graduate that way [end]
[start] Wow that’s an impressive achievement. Be proud of yourself, you have done something incredible [end]
[start] Yayyy! Great job!! Congratulations! Keep it up😇 [end]
[start] That’s great man! The next generation won’t be complete idiots... [end]
[start] Congrats! Keep up the good work and keep striving for greatness. But, always remember to stay humble. [end]
[start] Bravo! It is a big accomplishment and I am proud of you all the way from France. [end]
[start] As a fellow high schooler, I congratulate you. [end]
[start] Congrats!! I'd rather have high grades than a high SAT/ACT score any day. Having a high score means you are smart and can apply that knowledge. Having good grades means you those things are also true, but additionally, you will work hard to achieve your goals.  That is a rare and valuable combination! [end]
[start] I was once 1 out of xx students in my high school class and I felt pretty proud of myself. Turns out that everyone with a 4.0 was tied for 1st place and because my high school curriculum was pretty easy that ended up being like a dozen people. [end]
[start] so sick bro!!! [end]
[start] Nice job!! [end]
[start] As someone whose mom never celebrated her good grades but only shamed me for the "bad" grades (not a C! Ugh...)  I want to be one of the people who says GOOD FREAKING JOB! INTERNET HIGH FIVE! [end]
[start] Definitely a big deal. I'm sure you worked hard for that, give yourself a treat!  (uh, that sounded weird. I think you know what I mean tho) [end]
[start] Good shit 🤘🏻 [end]
[start] Awesome! Good job! [end]
[start] Congratulations, sweetheart! Good job—I’m sure you worked very hard on your grades, keep it up! :) [end]
[start] That's amazing!!! Keep up the amazing work :) [end]
[start] Is your name Smitty WerbenJagerManJensen?? Because HE WAS NUMBER 1!!!! [end]
[start] This is a big deal. I care [end]
[start] Eh it’s all just time allocation [end]
[start] Well done! What an achievement :) you should be proud. I hope you continue to make yourself proud academically! [end]
[start] As long as you're not in "serial killer 101" class then well done! [end]
[start] Kudos to you. That is MOST awesome. Wow. Seriously. PROUD of you! Woowhoo. [end]
[start] im not happy for you in any respect [end]
[start] I was top of my grade too, wait 5 years it don’t mean shit when ur depressed and broke [end]
[TITLE] My fiancé was killed by a drunk driver , but I still bought her a Valentines Day gift [TITLE]
[start] Do the things that help you heal in your own time.  No one can tell you how long you are allowed to hurt.  I hope you feel some sense of closure and can move on. But take your time. [end]
[start] Oh man my heart sank when I read this. I’m so, so sorry. I can’t tell you how to grieve, no one can. If you want and can afford a therapist, that might help, but don’t go if you don’t want to. [end]
[start] yeah im gonna go cry [end]
[start] One of my friends speaks on grief and has a newsletter for grief and she just posted a video today about getting presents for your person. I had never thought of it and it’s so beautiful [end]
[start] I wish you the best. I’m so sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] I’m so sorry. You need time, it’s only been a few months. Hope the drunk driver is in prison [end]
[start] But it is not valentines day? Also, i checked your account and 4 months ago you commented on plenty of fish subreddit that your girlfriend broke up with you so i dont this is true.. [end]
[start] Sending love [end]
[start] aww man this breaks my heart... i cant imagine what ur going through. you shouldnt feel like you need to stop doing the things you love to do for her one day if you dont feel like it. people expect us to get over the death of those we love over time. however, you shouldnt feel like its supposed to get any easier. heal at your own pace or never at all, that is completely up to you. best regards. [end]
[start] Wow that’s incredible. She must have been truly special. [end]
[start] Dear god, please keep the boy I love healthy and safe. I’m so sorry that happened [end]
[start] God damn. I am so so sorry for your loss. I literally do not know what to say but hopefully if there is an afterlife you will meet her again [end]
[start] That's crazy mane [end]
[start] I'm already depressed, why you got to do this to me [end]
[start] The last thing she would want is for you to still be grieving 5 years later. Not going to be a popular opinion but you must move on this is truly not healthy. [end]
[start] This just broke my heart. I am so sorry and you will heal when you are ready. Big internet hug to you. [end]
[start] Please make sure you have backup copies of that good morning video - you don't want to lose it if your phone dies. I've seen people lose all their voicemails from loved ones that way. [end]
[start] Drunk driving is disgusting. Shame on anyone who does such a nefarious, selfish thing. Once I know a person has done such a thing, I have cut them out of my life for good right after letting them know the selfish piece of shits they are.  Sorry for your loss <3 [end]
[start] Take all the time you need and do whatever you need to do to feel better. It doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks in this situation, your feelings are always valid. [end]
[TITLE] An Article I'd like to share: Life lessons from this pandemic [TITLE]
[TITLE] Had the best night with someone [TITLE]
[start] This feeling is absolutely great, Happy for you and really proud of your patience to not mess up or pressurize too much, you're an awesome dude [end]
[TITLE] Shaved my head and my family is mad [TITLE]
[start] Do you like your new look? Honestly if it makes you happy then that's all that matters. A new hairstyle isn't causing any harm to them whatsoever. Their response is completely on them and not your problem. [end]
[start] Bet you're from Italy [end]
[start] What the fucking hell? Dude I’m so sorry you have to go through such bullshit. My brother in law just shaved his head after having long, gorgeous hair for years. When we all saw him, it was only compliments and love. That’s how it should be. You probably already know this, but your family sucks ballsacks for making you feel bad over a *haircut.* [end]
[start] Run. Just run.   They are scared that you're getting independent. [end]
[start] I shaved my head at 20.  My mother looked disappointed and later took me aside in private to say “You look very ugly” like no one else wanted to say it.  My grandmother asked “did it work?” and when I asked what she meant she said she thought I was trying to “get rid of the bugs” in my hair.  Anyway, that was over 25 years ago and we all laugh about it now.  This will pass. [end]
[start] I mean, it's not like you shaved THEIR heads, right? They'll get over it. Ignore their dramatics and just keep living your life. [end]
[start] Sorry, sounds like the people around you are very shallow. There’s more to life than how you look. It has to be nerve-racking when you do something and think it’s not a big deal, and yet everyone has an opinion on it. I guess now you know for the future to do what you want and live on your own terms. I think it’s a step towards true freedom. [end]
[start] Is it something related to religion that makes them mad? The fact that they never allowed you to meet girls etc. gives the impression of a very conservative household?     You are 18 and have therefore reached age of majority. You have the right to do whatever you like with your hair, relationships or whatever.     Why should shaving the head even be a big deal? [end]
[start] I'm seeing this guy and he also started shaving his head because his hair was receding. He said it's been about 5 years and now he's really okay with it but it did take time for him to adjust. Personally, I really like it. I was surprised by it at first but it's grown on me.  Anyway, I guess my point is it'll take time for everyone to adjust. Even you. What's important, as others said, is it makes you feel more comfortable and confident. It's your head after all ❤️ [end]
[start] I was 18 when I shaved my head for the first time. (I’m AFAB.) My mother was pissed, but honestly that had been the plan for four years—I just didn’t have the guts to do it.   I totally get you on not looking for validation but also wanting it. The last thing we want is to disappoint our “loved ones”. If we do, it must mean they won’t ever like us again. And... all that dark stuff that doesn’t need to be spelled out here.  They’ll get over it. And if they don’t, well, good riddance. Can I ask what country you’re emigrating to? [end]
[start] lol wtf? tell your family you are your own person and can make your own choices. [end]
[start] Your parents need to grow a set of balls [end]
[start] They would probably have been happier to have you grow one side really long and do a comb over because then they could still pretend that you are not an adult making your own decisions. Own your new look. But do buy one of those rainbow colored clown wigs (the big curly ones) to wear when you visit them since, evidently, any hair is better than none.   I am always amazes at people who criticize someone else's hair. They are not the ones having to do the upkeep or worry about thinning. My husband is also follicularly challenged. When he decided to keep his head close shaven, it was like liberation day for him. No more worrying about how his remaining hair looked in proportion to the expanding bald area. He always looks neat and rugged. I bet you do as well.  When your family tells you they are mad about your hair,  remind them that it is a result of genetics which is their fault. Then tell them if the best they can do is be mad over your lack of hair, then you must be a pretty awesome dude! [end]
[start] As a boy I had longer hair (as in not boy short) much of my life.  Granted I have nice hair.  I remember sometime in my 20s deciding to take a trimmer with a guard on and take most of it off, to like an inch.  The first time my Mom saw me, she acted so upset.   She was already upset about my Dad spending money to buy a modern big TV and then she threw in the "and (me) cut his hair!"  It didn't really bother me, just felt typical.  My Mom had a lot of anxiety.   And at that point in my life I was used to people, including my parents and family, being upset or critical with my decisions.  It feels like no matter what I do, or we do, there's always somebody out there who doesn't like it and feels the need to tell us so.  Probably why my self confidence is never rock solid.   And I have tried to overcompensate with periods of not giving a fuck.  Such is life.   That's ultimately why I come to the conclusion that you can't care what other people think.   Even though I still do to some extent.   It's never all or nothing. [end]
[start] Sounds like they are mad that you did it without their permission.  I can see a kid being startled and crying but adults not speaking to you?  That’s just ridiculous. [end]
[start] Don't feel bad. My friends and family did the same thing to me years ago too. They kept giving advice on how I should of just kept it and styled it different etc.  And I mean ALL of my friends and family.  They even had nick name insults that they thought were funny.  Chemo kid  Cancer boy  Racist  Kkk  It hurt, but I acted like It didn't.  Just go to show even your closest ones to you will judge you on your looks.  My own girlfriend at the time told me she was no longer attracted to me.  Going bald sucks. I been bald now longer than when I had hair. I don't give a fuck anymore.  What hurt most was how they all reacted in a negative way. I'm still the same person lol. [end]
[start] Don't pander to others self interest, do what you want and try to get away from them. [end]
[start] Do they realize it's just hair? There's got to be another reason why they're acting so overdramatic. It grows out! It's not like you went home with a face tattoo or a missing limb! [end]
[start] What the fuck. It's hair how the hell are they so upset about it. I'm sorry my dude [end]
[start] I am so confused.  Is there a religious aspect here that is causing this emotional reaction from your fam?  Your head, your choice. [end]
[start] This is either fake or you're in a really weird situation.  I'm a fellow head-shaver and have been for more than a decade.  It's a source of endless compliments.  I've never heard of anyone getting the amount of pushback you're describing. [end]
[start] Damn that sucks. [end]
[start] They gonna get over it it’s just a haircut [end]
[start] What's up with looking down on Baldies that families have? I did the same thing! I'm 20 and started to lose too much hair, tho' I did go from metalhead long-ass hair to bald so I guess in my case it was sudden, but like, it's...it's just hair? Who cares? What, am I Samsom? Am I gonna suddenly be weak? Or a skinhead? No, I'm still dorky stupid dumbass me. Superificialities really annoy me honestly, not like I'm pretty either, so eh, nothing changed other than folks being drama queens about it. [end]
[start] Rock it man. They will get used to it. [end]
[start] Just tell them “Seth Everman energy” and leave it there.  And they should support you. Jeez! [end]
[start] A very good friend of mine went from being a depressed early-20-something with a severely receding hairline to a confident early-30-something with a shaved head. He lived at home and barely socialized at the worst of it, now he has a great job, a wife, and a baby due in a few weeks. I won't say that shaving his head literally turned his life around, but I do think that there was a symbolic importance to the act for him.  I'm sorry your family isn't supportive, that must really hurt. But, from a total internet stranger, I praise you for this awesome act of self-acceptance and wish you nothing but the best in life! [end]
[start] Lol bro make them pay for a hair transplant [end]
[start] I shaved my head at 17 and had the same reaction. It sucked. Real bad. Im 23 now though and everyone else can go fuck themselves [end]
[start] Wtf why would anyone be bothered by that? That is very strange behaviour. [end]
[start] Had long hair for over 20yrs, kept being told to get a haircut, my only response was idgaf and if I ever do get a haircut it'll be shaved off as I really cba dealing with hair gel on a daily basis especially in a country where the weather is mostly stationary rain hanging in the air or horizontal rain. So one day last year during a blisteringly hot summer, the heat madness made me realise that getting rid of a lions mane would help me cool down and holy crap was I wrong, it was still blisteringly hot just now I need suncream on the dome and the slightest breeze was like a -40 Arctic chill... Pretty much got the same response from the maternal unit, long story short, they'll get used to it if you keep shaving it! [end]
[start] tf it’s your own head [end]
[start] Um..do they realize hair grows back? [end]
[start] As a fellow baldy...it’s liberating! Keep shaving it, my friend. [end]
[start] I know I'm dating myself and this might be unfamiliar to you, but:  * Telly Savalas * Yul Brynner  These men were iconic to me when I was growing up. [end]
[start] To be honest your family’s reaction sounds quite pathetic. Is the quality of their life or relationship with their son determined by the amount of hairs on his head? No. This decision has nothing to do with them and their obsession over it is disturbing. [end]
[start] i can’t imagine why they would be sad or mad at you. A hair cut garners a “wow you look awesome” at most, but definitely not a negative reaction. it’s honestly baffling [end]
[start] Man, fuck that noise. I started losing my hair about the same time as you I'm guessing. I was around 14 or 15. As you know, pretty traumatic in high school. The best thing I ever did was progressively trimming it shorter and eventually shaving it. I've been doing that for about twenty years now and it's great. Saved money and time and I like how I look better anyway. I'm sorry your family didn't accept that! What matters is that you accept it. [end]
[start] Their feelings towards your new look is their problem not yours. You love your new look and that’s good enough reason for you to keep it. Maybe it’s just the newness of it all. Give them time to adjust. Oh, and I think bald is sexy 😉 [end]
[start] Bro I'm so sorry to hear of your hairline at 18 already. But for real idk what the deal is with your parents. Like sure it's weird and you can laugh it off and say hey I wanted to shave it to treat my scalp better, haha look at my shaved head. But they're acting like you tattooed a big fat swastika on your head or some shit, get a grip people. [end]
[start] Your family is a bunch of weirdos for getting emotional over your hair.  I bet you look great! And how you feel is all that matters💜 [end]
[start] Dude, put on some upside down shades, play a synth, and rock that Seth Everman look. [end]
[start] Jesus I didn't know people could act like that. You're doing something completely normal. Your family wants to control you completely. Stay strong, a lot of us feel like we don't have freewill and the freedom to be our real selves. Don't let them stop you, even be worse so they can get some perspective. If you never do anything wrong even small things will be tret like you killed their cat. It's also so unhealthy for your mentality to not be able to be who you really are. You've got to fight to be your real self, shaving head is progress towards that goal. Also become slightly more sneeky eg get a girlfriend, use a guy friend to cover for you. [end]
[start] I remember when my (then) boyfriend (now husband) shaved his head after years of his hair thinning. He was really nervous but after he shaved it- he never looked back. I love his head bald. Now his favorite thing is he can say he’s “bald by choice” lol I’m sorry your family’s reaction was hurtful. But it sounds like the first of many decisions you’ll make as an adult about your own life that won’t make your controlling family happy. [end]
[start] My family didn’t like that I shaved my head but I like it and that’s all that matters. As long as you can wake up everyday and enjoy looking at your bald head in the mirror then it’s the right thing to do. Plus eventually you will move out and they will miss that bald head [end]
[start] Hey, I understand not getting validation from your family feels really bad. You need to talk it out with them. If you can bear the consequences and will be ready for it, let the argument heat up let them say everything that they have to and while they do this you should not only let them speak, say what's in your heart. There are two possible outcomes, they will come to terms with your decision or things may turn bad(I won't point out in what ways, you can easily imagine what can happen).  If you things turn bad with your family, you need to leave. You have taken this step for a reason, they need to accept this. If they cannot, there is no reason for you to live while passively facing such treatment, unless you are still dependent on them.  All this is of course your choice.  One thing I wanted to make sure, there is no cultural thing about getting your head shaved, is there? For eg., among hindus men in family shave their head when their mother/father dies. [end]
[start] Gonna need a before and after pic... [end]
[start] I think you’re chill. Let your family be disappointed, it shouldn’t matter that much to you. I disappoint my parents everyday haha it’s your life. [end]
[start] That's a very strange reaction from your family. Going bald really isn't that weird. If someone I knew shaved their hair, I'd be like "oh hey I noticed you shaved your hair" and nothing else would happen. [end]
[start] How does your shaved head affect their life. It simply doesn’t. They’re dumb for caring so much. Would they have acted differently if you donated to cancer? Make that your excuse lol. I am both surprised and furious that your hair would make such an impact on their mood. If my brother did the same I’d probably throw a couple jokes then forget it the next day. [end]
[start] I walked on egg shells in marriage for ten years before an inept barber forced the issue. It’s been brilliant, I’m basically 6 inches of Dwayne Johnson.   It’s the wrong six inches, but in 15 years I’ll get his body too! The ex knew what they were doing, and I’m guessing your family do to: they’re afraid to lose you to press, dates and fame.   Just remind them that you’ll never forget them when you’re famous. [end]
[start] Lol really? Some people are too crazy about hair, who cares honestly. If you wanna shave, you  shave. It's not like you did a face tattoo. Your family should be ashamed by giving that much shit about stuff that 1: Doesn't matter. and 2: Something you wanted to do.  Stuff like this cause more damage to you than they think. Stuff like this make you insecure about your own opinions. This is not good in the long run. Don't bother about them. They are wrong, you are right! [end]
[start] Yeah, they don’t know how cool you look. Give it time, they will get used to it. Live for yourself man, not them. If your parents love you truly, they will come around to respect the decision. Mine did.   I know you became 10 X hotter with that new confident look. [end]
[start] I was about 20 when I finally admitted the truth and shaved my head, but for about 5 more years I still had enough in the middle to occasionally grow a mohawk. One time I went to see my parents with a pink mohawk and I ended up not speaking to my family for 7 months. It changed the nature of my relationship with my dad and we're much more copacetic now.  Next step - get someone you find attractive to rub your shaved scalp. That shit's the jam.  It sounds like your parents are overprotective; you should seriously look at this as a first time setting some boundaries that will allow for a healthier, more adult relationship. "From now on, if you like what I'm doing with my hair you can complement it, but nothing you or I do will make me less bald so you're not allowed to comment in the other direction. Consider this a general statement on things that are only skin deep, not just about my shaved head." [end]
[start] Bruh, if your family is really that upset over a haircut maybe you need to distance yourself a little. [end]
[start] I would've totally flipped the script on them by saying "Don't act like this isn't the fault of your shitty genetics mom & dad." [end]
[start] Sound like a bunch of weirdos. It will be back in a month anyway. Not that it’s any of their business what’s on your head. Embrace you [end]
[start] It sound like they see you as *their* child, instead of your own person that happens to be their child. Like, you damaged their property of something. Like you keyed their car [end]
[start] Yeah, my hairline began receding at 18 and at 23 I decided to just shave it all off. Thing is I get a lot more compliments about it because I shave it constantly and keep it looking clean. I like the look, and it’s way better than those guys who do everything they possibly can to keep their obviously balding hairlines going. Just embrace it. Plus, I didn’t have to worry about finding a barber during the pandemic haha. It literally hurts nobody, if you like it keep it. [end]
[start] your family needs to grow the fuck up. you have my sympathy having to deal with them:/ [end]
[start] Shaving your hair is not really such a bad thing. I did it a couple of times while I was young. It really helps the head rest from the hair.  When I did it the first time, my family was upset. But that was because they where not used to seeing me with a shaved head.  Most people don't react in a positive way to changes. So don't let it bother you. You are still you. It's not like your hair will never grow up again. I think your family is just overreacting because they where used to look at you with a hair and the sudden change make them feel uncomfortable. However, the important thing is for YOU to feel ok. [end]
[start] Great priorities ur family has [end]
[start] Hey! Bud! I did the same thing! I feel great for it. I've gotten mostly great responses, and a few hesitant or negative ones, which is what I'd expect for any major transformation. There's always only the one response:  "I did this for me, not for you."  I'm sorry your family sucks. [end]
[start] That sucks, mate. I honestly think hair is the absolute dumbest thing to be mad about. It grows back if YOU don't like the look. But what YOU like is all that matters. Family just downright are asshats sometimes though, and so I send you an internet-mom-hug! [end]
[start] Your family's fucking weird for this. [end]
[start] Bald guys are sexy [end]
[start] Its kinda crazy they're acting like this over a haircut...you do you, if they love you (which I'm sure they do), they'll come around...if they wont talk to you because of a haircut...I mean come on. [end]
[start] Your family is nuts. I went bald in my early twenties and have kept it short/shaved ever since. [end]
[start] Why is it so upsetting? [end]
[start] You are still you, fabulous you. Your hair was just going along for the ride. [end]
[start] I’m sorry your parents are reacting this way.   Do your best to not let their reaction hurt you.  I know it’s easier said than done.  If you like your look, then embrace.  They will grow into it.  You made a decision about your body, if they don’t ever get past this, then it’s their problem.    I use a #1 guard on my head and just love it.  I wish I would have done this years ago. [end]
[start] Lol who the fuck gets mad about what someone else does with their hair. [end]
[start] that's crazy. sounds like they can't accept you getting older maybe?   at first I thought this was going to be a girl who shaved her head given the reaction but I wouldn't expect it for a guy. It's not exactly an unusual "hairstyle" [end]
[start] Well come to the Chome Dome club brother. You are an alpha now. lol. I joined the balled headed club when I was 24. Been bald suits me and is so easy to maintain. Also you tend too look more masculine when you bald. You have joined a prestigious club brother. The Rock, Jason Statham, Vin Diesel, Tyrese, Bruce Willis, Stonecold Steve Austin and myself all welcome you. CHOME DOME FOR LIFE BABY!! [end]
[start] your parents are dumb and your niece is probably too young to understand...  i had the similar experience [end]
[start] It is a ridiculous reaction to you shaving your head. You are your own person and have every right to shave it if you want. I also shave my head and I love the way it feels. I know it is hard to be around their reactions, but you are not hurting anyone with your choice and you only live once ! [end]
[start] im gonna be blunt with this. your family are shitty. not to mention toxic. if they can't support all of you then they are not worth any of your time. being closed of that why is hard to get though and you finding a way to do that. If they don't like it tell em to fuck off. you don't have to be nice with this either. loving yourself that's what matters. if your hurt tell em upfront to. if they can't deal with this then they are not what a family should be. [end]
[start] Jesus it’s just hair. Wtf is wrong with people? Do you, man. I’m sure you look awesome! [end]
[start] You do you. They will get over it eventually, it's just hair. [end]
[start] Can you help me understand the de-humanizing feeling you're experiencing? [end]
[start] Now you need to buff-up to complete the package. Time to start weight lifting. No one cares if a man with a 6-pack is bald. [end]
[start] Shaved my head at 22. Way better than the receding. Good on you for letting it go. Confidence is more attractive than hair [end]
[start] My family was surprised to be sure but that is just uncalled for. Worst I got was a worried look from my father because I was going through a lot at the time I first shaved my head. He was just worried I did it based on some rash decision or external influence. [end]
[start] Fuck them. It’s your fucking hair. My mom still tries to tell me what to do with my hair and I’m almost 30. Good thing she lives in a different state now [end]
[start] You’re a grown ass man, you literally don’t need their approval for anything. [end]
[start] It's probably just a little shock from your new appearance. My partner is bald (and he's SO hot to me, btw), but he has a large beard that I'm very, very attached to. Occasionally he shaves it off- usually without telling me first- and, as weird as it sounds, I am literally repelled by how he looks at first. We jokingly call my reaction "trauma" bc it seriously does freak me out.  I will always prefer him with a beard, but after a few days the shock wears off and I get used to it. I bet the same will happen with your family.  Regardless, I'm glad you made the choice that feels good to you, and that makes you feel good about yourself! Confident bald men are super sexy! [end]
[start] Sounds like the perfect first step to reminding your parents that you need to grow as a person & a man. It is really good that you have moved out. And please try not to let their disappointment control how you live.  I know it’s hard but this is what we call the long game. Continue learning about girls, life, education. (Just don’t marry or have babies with the first girl who you think you love. Relationships take a lot of practice ) And continue to establish the life that YOU want & hopefully your parents will realize that you are doing just fine & stop worrying about you.  Don’t over explain yourself because Doing that gives everyone else control to continue to judge you. Say this, “It’s what I wanted. Oh I completely believe it is best. I am happy with my choices. And as an adult I may or may not regret my choices but being an adult means I’m taking responsibility and will live with my choices.” Good luck sweetie I’m proud of you. You are so very brave. [end]
[start] Well if it's any consolation, my Nana got the same reaction when she "bobbed" her hair 100 years ago. And you might try clipping it down to maybe 5mm for a suedehead rather than a cueball look. I went suedehead around the turn of the century, due to thinning, and I'm happy with the results. [end]
[start] Their reactions are really weird and over the top. My brother also shaved his head once and it made him look like a thug but no one got upset about it. We just made fun of him a bit. [end]
[start] It's hair FFS. Your hair to be exact, and you can do whatever the hell you want with it. [end]
[start] Screw the haters, men who are balding or have a receding hairline 150% look and (from the ones I know personally) feel better with a shaved head. You should always do whatever makes you happiest, regardless what your friends or family think (so long as no one gets hurt, obviously). I'm sure you look amazing with the shaved head :D [end]
[start] They sound like fucking weirdos shaved head normally looks better keep it [end]
[start] I was confused about their reaction until you mentioned that they’ve always been overprotective of you.  Shaving your head is a big statement - it’s against conformity and showing you want to take control of your image - and that is a lot to swallow for a family that doesn’t want to see you as an individual.  It sounds like you’re still struggling with this too. It’s healthy and normal to consider the opinions of loved ones, but they shouldn’t hold too much weight, especially when you’re all adults.  They’ll get used to your appearance, they don’t really have a choice, but I think this will be good for everyone looking back. You can do what you want and they can’t stop you, only support you. [end]
[start] Shave their heads too [end]
[start] Ugh I’m so so sorry you have to deal with that. This is also a trigger for me. Just remember, NOBODY should treat you differently based on the way you want to express yourself with your hair, clothing, etc. If they do, we probably need to question why they want to control us instead of love us. But most of all, take care of your happiness first. You are always enough by being your true self. [end]
[start] Welcome to the clan, brother!!  &#x200B;  It's fucking amazing, you don't have to worry about taking care of your hair or anything. I trim mine once a week with a #2 blade (6.3 mm) and it always feels just amazing. I prefer keeping a bit of length because it can block the sun some during the summer and helps keep my head a bit warmer in the winter. In Italy though I feel like winter isn't much of a concern for you as it is for me in Chicago. Of course I shampoo and condition every day (I have a beard too, so mostly it's for that), but I really don't need to use much.  &#x200B;  I highly recommend getting yourself a nice pair of clippers and cutting your hair yourself frequently, it'll keep you feeling and looking better.   &#x200B;  You're going to love keeping your head shaved or closely trimmed. [end]
[start] My family made negative comments for ALL my haircuts through my life.   Too short  You should cut them  Too eccentric  Too proper  You had such beautiful hair before, such a shame...  (Hahaha i just saw the comments about Italian families and they are of Italian descent!) [end]
[start] Small tip. Learn not to care what people think. I mean sure I'd yearn for some meaure of acceptance from friends and family but i wouldn't let their opinions influence my decisions. I'm rocking that haircut. Deal with it. Just act like you don't care trust me. [end]
[start] Embrace the bald, I bet it looks good [end]
[start] People had a similar reaction when my boyfriend shaved his head for the first time, but your parents sound very overly sensitive. It's your hair not theirs! [end]
[start] Wigs are a thing [end]
[start] Damn, its just hair. It grows back. I dont understand why its such a big deal to your family?  You're not the crazy one here. I bet you look great! [end]
[start] Ok we gotta see this ... got a pic ? [end]
[start] It's a love-in!  You do you, my smooth-headed friend. [end]
[start] Take no notice they will eventually get over themselves. [end]
[start] Sorry to hear about your selfish family.  If you like it then it doesn’t matter what your insecure family thinks.  Live your life as you want it and fuck those who think you have responsibility for their feelings.  They need to grow up and take some responsibility for their own feelings and reactions to life around them.   My dad was the same but fuck him. We can’t live our lives making other people happy all the time. Always put yourself and your feelings first, but don’t be a asshole about it.   I bet you look great tho but like I said, fuck what I think as long you are happy with your decision.   I respect you for your choice! [end]
[start] Minoxidil? [end]
[start] wtf is wrong with them? Such a weird and crazy reaction.       Just keep doing it this way, they'll get used to it in no time. [end]
[start] Tell your folks if they wanted beautiful hair on their son, they should have passed on better genes. Their fault entirely. [end]
[start] Your family is stupid.  What the fuck does it have to do with them? [end]
[start] I’m confused [end]
[start] I’m 19 years old and had severely damaged hair that was my own fault after constant coloring and bleaching, and I made the impulsive choice to shave my head. I regretted it for about a day but ever since, I swear to everyone it’s the best choice I ever made for my hair. Notice I’m not taking into account other opinions, because they don’t matter. If you love it and rock it, and have confidence in yourself, that’s all that matters. [end]
[start] Do they know it grows back? Not that you have to let it, but they’re acting like you chopped down the last maple tree ever and syrup is a thing of the past. That would be a crisis; a haircut is not. [end]
[start] TLOU2 Vibes [end]
[start] Fake. For internet points. [end]
[start] No ones opinion of you matters. What matters is how you feel. If you like it, fuck em. [end]
[start] odd....a couple of years ago i shaved my head because my wife thought i would look good...not loosing my hair at all. i have kept it that way ever since because i like it. it looks good and is easy to keep.  but i NEVER got any negative feedback from anyone. so i have no idea why they acted as they did. [end]
[start] I'm sorry you're dealing with this.   I am proud of you for taking a stand. It's your body, they have no say. Be strong. [end]
[start] That’s quite an over reaction on their part and seems like a toxic environment. I’m sorry that’s happened but it’s great that you love it! Don’t let this affect you..  You should take a look at this account on tiktok (or Instagram same name) -> @kreftscouch you’ll see why.   Sending good energy to you. [end]
[start] Probably thought you had a serious disease like cancer [end]
[start] Where are u from bro?  My family will probably have a good laugh if I did the same [end]
[start] Fuck em! Rock it my bald brother!! I waited until my mid 30s and I should have started sooner. Pro tip the ladies shaving gel keeps my dome super smooth. Have some gold too brother! [end]
[start] I don’t understand. What is their problem with it? Is it a religious thing? [end]
[start] Lmaoooo  Good. Good. Let the hate flow through them. It's your body. I hope you've got a thousand other messages in your inbox supporting you, but I want to chip in all the same.  Attract the people you want with the body you desire. [end]
[start] As a fellow bald man, welcome to the club! We have meetings on the third Tuesday of every month where we discuss pop culture, politics, and rub our heads together to give each other strength. [end]
[start] You had me at "after years of having a receding hairline" but you are just 18? [end]
[start] their reactions are completely out of line, i'm sorry you have to deal with that. your body, your hair, your head, your choice. if they don't have anything nice to say they shouldn't say anything at all.   my dad started losing his hair at only 17 years old. he is in his 50s now and since i was a toddler (i am 22) he has shaved his entire head. i think he looks great. i also think it makes him look much younger and better than he would look if he did not shave his head and instead looked balding.   my only comment on your newly shaved head: SUNSCREEN EVERYDAY!! even in the winter! no matter where you live and what your skin tone is! it will be exposed a lot and you're still super young so you have lots of time to make sure you use the right SPF for you. [end]
[start] It's your head Do what pleases you.. I shaved my head this summer due to fact barbers were still not open.. I since then grew it back with winter around the corner.. You.. Did it for a noble reason So Be It [end]
[start] When i first shaved my head at 17 i arrived home at 2am,2 hours after curfew, and my mother took one look at me and told me that i 'look like a convict' in an angry / disgusted tone. Wasn't nice and it didn't help that i was tripping balls at the time. Youll get through this but hang tight, its your head! [end]
[start] I am sorry for you. Your familly... Act like a bunch of assholes. About your niece I can understand but I don't understand your familly. Do you have a terminal deases? Because if not I don't see why they would react in such a dramatic way. They acted like you told them you got drafted and forced to go to the front of the battles. [end]
[start] You mentioned immigrating to another country.  Where do you originate from and where are you now?  Maybe this is a cultural thing?  Because in the US at least, it's fairly common for guys to shave their heads even if they aren't balding. [end]
[start] Honestly, as long as you like you you look f'em. They sounds far to concerned with what they've deemed socially acceptable and care far too much on things that don't need to be care about much at all.   If you want to stick it to the you can show up with a (temporary) tattoo on the dome, really givem a scare.  Other than that as long as your happy and confident, it's none of their concern. Your hair not theirs. [end]
[start] Ok the niece crying I can understand but your da holding back tears is weird as hell, unless he thinks you’re going nazi skinhead or something. Clarify with your family it’s just you embracing the bald, not you becoming a hateful fascist or anything [end]
[start] I realize you have gotten a ton of comments but you prompted me to think! So I still want to share :)  I really think that our life is a process of learning to separate ourselves and to stand in our own “sense of identity” regardless of what others ultimately think of us. Becoming truly confident in who we are is such a process! It’s amazing how much others are affected by what we do (such as shaving your head) as if it really affected THEM. And then their response wants to TRY to really affect you! Isn’t that so interesting ?  I mean , it is hard hard hard to allow other people to deal (or NOT deal!) with their own various issues, whatever they may be and then not take them ON. You are awesome !! You are being successful and smart in how you are fighting to establish your solid self esteem! We ALL have to do it ! And I am so proud of you!!!! Thanks for sharing ! Rub that big old bald head of yours for me! And fight on little brother ! [end]
[start] You can't please everyone. That is a sad reality of life, they will get over it if they care about you.   Situation sucks. [end]
[start] It’s their fault for having shit genetics they can’t be mad at you OP [end]
[start] I read your username as “proudbaldy” at first [end]
[start] Like Heisenberg? [end]
[start] Don't mind them. My mother cried when she finally saw I had small plugs in my ears and guilted me into taking them out. [end]
[start] It's hair.  They all shouldn't be so worked up about it.  I bet it looks great on you, my friend. [end]
[start] My dad was also upset when my brother got even just a buzz cut. He's very conservative and only approves of things he finds normal. [end]
[start] It’s your hair. If it’s more comfortable for you to shave your head, DO IT, & embrace it!! I’m proud of you for taking the leap, & I wouldn’t let their opinion get to you. They’ll get over it as hair grows back. [end]

[TITLE] If you live in Alaska and voted for Trump, [TITLE]
[start] 100% true. The Trump culters are the dumbest fuckers on earth but the ones in Alaska have to be the dumbest of all.  And here's the sad thing - in a year they'll all blame Biden.   Dumbest mother fuckers on earth. [end]
[start] I saw that on the news, they're selling areas of land to companies to start drilling for oil and shit, it's ridiculous [end]
[start] I live in Alaska and did not vote for Trump.  I am very angry of all that is happening here. Not only is all the drilling happening, but Trump undid Obama regulations on ANWR that were put in place to protect this area. ANWR is one of the last "untouched" wilderness areas in the world. [end]
[start] What Trump-voting Alaskan would have called themselves a conservationist in the first place? [end]
[start] I was sickened and so upset when I saw this on the news. It’s disgusting. [end]
[start] Sheesh I was wondering about that too....  Good job Alaska smh.... [end]
[start] And experts were saying that there's plenty of oil to be drilled in the lower 48, no need to drill in AK. [end]
[start] for anyone who voted for or likes trump.  your ‘president’ is having a fucking temper tantrum in the whitehouse and you think he’s fit to lead america?    some americans are just dumb as fuck, no offence to the smart americans (mfs who didn’t vote trump) [end]
[start] That's happening? I thought the supreme court stopped it [end]
[start] Yeah. Fuck Drumpf and everyone that voted for him. He’s been on a nationwide tour to convert protected areas into personal kickbacks. Utah’s Bear’s Ears  National Monument was especially debilitating. 80% sold off. It has more U.S. ancient artifacts than everywhere else in the country combined. I can’t wait to see what the taxpayer cleanup costs are after the mining and land poisoning is complete. Fuck.   [Trump move to downsize Utah national monuments could reshape land conservation](https://youtu.be/EsRz38yFbcY)  [Public Trust Feature Film | The Fight for America’s Public Lands](https://youtu.be/OGjnIG7puzY) [end]
[start] As someone who lives in Alaska and voted for trump i can tell you very few of us are  conservationist. The only thing most Alaskans care about is increasing oil production, because we are entirely dependent on it. [end]
[start] Sooooo what you going to do without oil?? [end]
[start] I don't know much about the issue but it seems like oil drilling would have a relatively tiny impact as a portion of land area in Alaska. Alaska is really big and it sort of seems like oil drilling doesn't have to be very high impact. Is the concern related to possible oil spills? [end]
[start] Id rather ruin a place most people would never go to than see American people lose jobs because democrats want to go electric. [end]

[TITLE] I was helping a friend sell her PS4 on facebook and 2 people in a row tried to scam us and I feel terrible... [TITLE]
[start] This is actually very common, and while it *might* have something to do with how she looks, it's very unlikely. It's a fake check scam, and you can read ALL about them over on r/Scams  That board will have all the info you want, and you can even share this there to get more responses! 😊 [end]
[start] When selling something online cash only and meet in a safe public place. Some people even like to do it at a police station that usually scares off people up to no good.   Pay with a check haha you'd have to be smoking something extra strong to take a check from some random person buying a PS4. Cash only if they didn't have time to go to the bank that's their problem.

There is no "official" timeline when you're supposed to know what to do. It might not click until you're 23, who knows. Just don't let anyoe rush you into anything. [end]

[TITLE] I have depression and fear in my life. I am tired. [TITLE]
[start] You can't know, you never will. What ifs will remain unanswered. Regarding religion, it's entirely up to you to decide. I don't think religion out of fear makes good sense though. Imo, we have present and that's it. Your future self will be happy if you make most out of it. [end]
[start] Religion was created to keep the people in line.  Study all religions and you'll find it's all a crock. If religion was real, there would be one, it would have been around since the beginning of time. There can't be thousands of religions. If there was a god and he wanted people to spend their whole life telling him how great he is, he would have made it clear he exists and one religion for everyone to follow.   Once you stop the nonsense, life gets so much better. [end]
[start] I came to realize for myself that your own meaning is that you're *there.* Make the most of your present, and don't sweat too much... We're only human, imperfect beings. We aren't meant to understand everything, some things we may very well never know.   But instead of dreading it, you can look at it as a good thing. Life is as ugly as it can be beautiful, but it's universally mysterious. You'll be alright..! [end]
[TITLE] My mom wants me to use special creams to fade my scars. [TITLE]
[start] Yea its cool  On top of that, try the hyaluronic acid, it does wonders to the skin. [end]
[start] personally i don’t see a huge issue with this. i use scar cream on my stretch marks and on my face because i get fairly dark acne scars, I don’t really see it as meaning anything, i’m just trying to heal my skin. that being said, if your self harm scars are something that you now consider to be a part of yourself, something you are trying to embrace, or you just don’t see a need in trying to help them fade, then you shouldn’t feel obligated to use the cream. It’s up to you, but I don’t think that i would take this suggestion as an insult, unless there’s more context that makes it that way. She’s most likely just trying to provide you with a resource that she assumes you’d appreciate. [end]

[start] 1. I'm really observant and i can see what you feel even before you tell me 2. I'm a listener and will always listen carefully 3. I like to be self aware  4. I have beautiful curly hair ( if that counts?) 5. I am easy to trust. Ill never reveal your secret even if i hate you down to my guts [end]
[start] I'm unique among the other responders by:  1. I'm pretty bad at self-awareness (writing this takes a lot of effort) 2. I have no idea what other people are thinking or feeling, sometimes even after they tell me 3. My relationships with other people often end when they confide in me, but then realize how insensitive I am 4. My facial hair color is like salt-and-pepper: mostly black, but white here and there and it has been like this since it started growing 5. In most social situations, I'd rather blend in or even be invisible than be unique... [end]

[TITLE] PSA: use common sense [TITLE]
[start] common sense is extremely subjective. Not everybody will view the same things as common sense.  If you want to help your roommate then ask him if he wants your help, if he says yes then tip toe him into eating healthier, tell him how he is damaging his body; If he says no then you don't offer your knowledge. [end]
[start] I would actually like to thank you for being a "prick on the internet" because now I have something to read before I go to bed. if you starve yourself and eat five laxatives a day, how much can you realistically be pooping? I imagine your roomate's digestive system has been pretty much scraped clean at this point. [end]
[start] Omg it is a common sense type of thing and your room mate severely lacks it. What he’s doing definitely sounds dangerous, but you’re right people don’t like unwarranted advice. I hope he comes to realize this on his own. [end]

[start] I was totally expecting a sad story, so now I'm crying anyway because I'm really glad there are nice teachers like this out there [end]
[start] Yeah, my English teacher is the reason I decided to learn it. Thanks to that I could move abroad.  Shit, I gotta find her on Fb and thank her. [end]
[start] This is so true. I wrote previously on another thread about a relief teacher who somehow took a liking to me and praised a book I wrote and illustrated in front of the whole class. She also encourged me to enter a poetry contest that I would never otherwise have. I won it and still have the little crochet owl that was the prize.   School was my respite from home, where my parents did nothing but point out my flaws. Having this teacher point out talents and genuinely seem to care about my efforts stayed with me forever. I learned years later that she had passed away and I never got to thank her. But i think she probably knew how important that experience was to me.   I’m in my 30s now and have always been an avid reader and lover of education. It’s something I also try to instill in my kids. I hope to lift them up like she did me [end]
[start] You need to find her, and get her signed copies of your books. You have been challenged. [end]
[start] Butterfly effect in action🦋 [end]
[start] You’re damn right words matter. This got me right in the feels thinking about some teachers who encouraged me. One of my favorite teachers died suddenly last year from an infection she got while traveling around the world (she was a badass), and I wish I’d realized there would be no more time. So huge thanks for sharing your story & happy cake day, friend! [end]
[start] Reasons like this are why I became an elementary teacher. Thank you for sharing. [end]
[start] This is one of the best Reddit posts I've ever seen. From the bottom of my heart, Congratulations. [end]
[start] Happy cake day! When my son was in 5th grade, one of the teachers told him how awesome he did on his writing assignment. She then told him whenever he decides to write a book, she will pay for the publishing. He’s now in 7th grade, top of his class & in National Junior Honors Society. He is so eager to be someone important!  Teachers play a big role on letting our kids know they can achieve such great things. I appreciate them all! Congrats on all the books. That’s so awesome! [end]
[start] Goes the other way too. Had a band teacher that ruined me from music early in my childhood. Told me even though I could play the intermediate pieces without issue, I could not advance since I didn’t spend the proper amount of time as a beginner. Fuck that guy for holding me back. I still became a good musician eventually anyway but I always wondered if I would have had an easier time of it or a more diverse experience had that guy not been a tight wadded fuck clown. [end]
[start] As a teacher of 28 years, I love to hear stories like this.  It's very rewarding hearing from past students that we made a difference in their lives.  Keep up the great work! [end]
[start] What a beautiful story. Aren’t some teacher amazing! [end]
[start] Beautiful :) [end]
[start] This is amazing! I am so glad you had this experience. I personally had both positive moments with educators, similar to the one you described and negative ones. Interestingly the one that sticks out in my mind and sort of helped shape me into who I am today was a teacher who told me I was going nowhere in life. This actually had the effect making me work harder to prove her wrong and I now have a pretty successful career doing what I always wanted to do.   Thanks for sharing though, and yes words do matter! [end]
[start] I shared this with my company. Thank you for your post and reminder!  When I was 15, I had a scout after my baseball game tell me I could be a major league pitcher. I woke up at 6 am everyday for the next 7 years to get an extra workout in, changed my diet, and had a level of focus that I have a hard time replicating. I didn’t make the level of success that you had but I now can look back at my baseball career and see it as a success. Words matter. Someone believing in you matters. [end]
[start] I still remember all of the little meaningful words of encouragement I’ve been told by my middle school/high school teachers. They always feel more genuine coming from a teacher. [end]
[start] It's so easy to offer encouragement and kind words to people. Something so small and effortless can have such a major impact on the receiver. I'm glad you became a writer after that encounter, OP [end]
[start] This is the wholesome shit I needed to see.  I still remember when my seventh grade English teacher told me she was always excited to grade my work because she thought I wrote very well. Those words are so small in the moment but they end up meaning so much [end]
[start] I wrote a story about a year ago that got 800 readers and I was just fooling around on a small story writing website. I was considering going back and editing it or writing more stories and giving it a shot professionally but when I look back at the words I read I just cringe for some reason idk why. [end]
[start] Did you ever tell her?  Edit: disregard, i see the response above [end]
[start] Omg did u tell her how much she helped u?? [end]
[start] I was fortunate to have met several amazing teachers throughout my life. The subjects they taught didn't interest me very much but the lives they lived and stories they shared have influenced who I am today.  "a teacher affects infinity" [end]
[start] Not what I expected when I came here. Not sure what to say except thanks for making this post. [end]
[start] this. wouldve never escaped my abusive families or made it through college degrees if a few my teachers didnt nurture my love for knowledge and especially language. [end]

[start] I remember when I was 5 and my piano teacher said I would never be able to play piano because I didn't have the right fingers (I don't understand how my fingers differed from the next kid) but those words had an effect and they destroyed me.   My piano playing fingers type more than 100 wpm now, so there's that... [end]

[TITLE] I will literally never accept your chat request. [TITLE]
[start] I understand your pain, and nobody is sending you chat requests, this post is just a need for attention during time of need, just know that your not alone, I understand what it feels like to be neglected and not have any friends, but you have a good heart and I can sense that, you have a place in this world and you belong, I promise you things will get better, but for now, if you want a friend to trust I’m here 😊 [end]

[TITLE] I really need help. I have so much baggage to unpack and it's consumed me. I have no idea what to do in life anymore. [TITLE]
[start] You should open or join an online e-shop and hit different videogames subreddits and make a sample artwork for each of them and post it.   If its good, people gonna quickly ask where can they buy one for themselves. Then you link them to your shop. Many artists made big money from reddit thanks to a single post.   In the meantime, get a regular job as well. You need a constant cash flow.   On facebook, everyone's life look perfect, but its all just flexin for the last bucks. Behind that, their life has many issues as well.  It is proven scientifically that reading Fb posts makes you upset.   You sound like a beautiful girl. Be proud of your hair you dummy!  You're an adult now and you gotta take care of yourself. You have to let the pain go and move on.   You dont owe anything to anyone. You own who you are.  Dont give up baby, tommorow is another day. You gotta promise to yourself that you gonna try no matter what.   I moved out the house at 16 because of the toxic family. Now im 25 living in another country, happy and free.   You can do it! Dont give up!   Also go and meet some nice guy with a work and stable life.   Best of luck. [end]
[start] First of all, I just want to say that it was very brave of you to decide to open up. That can be the hardest thing in the world to most people, and its also the gateway to change. Simply being willing to acknowledge any of this, even to strangers, is a huge and wonderful step you've already made.   It breaks my heart to know that you have spent so much of your life, so traumatized by your own appearance. I think you sound beautiful, and intelligent, and worthy, and lovable, because you ARE. Don't you ever let anyone tell you otherwise. I completely understand the desire to control things/others because of a lack of control growing up. Not even an ounce to your extent, but I can understand that. I don't think it makes you a psycho, I think that's quite normal.   I'm just so sorry. I wish I could take away your pain and rewrite what you went through. But, the beautiful thing is that we always have the now. No matter what our past was, we can always change as much as we can whenever we choose. I would gladly be your friend. Online friends are every bit as legitimate as "in-person" friends, and online friends can't give you covid, haha. Please feel free to message me whenever you like, because I'd love to be your friend. You are interesting and insightful, and no matter what others have done to you, that isn't diminished.   &#x200B;  EVERYTHING you feel is valid, and important, and worthy of discussion. That is so important to believe for yourself. I'm happy to hear you have a place to live with a friend and your mom.   I don't think you should believe you "pissed away" this year. There is a deadly pandemic and its at the all time high right now, you're allowed to stay home and stay safe. There is no shame in that, honestly it protects other people and is admirable. I left my job in March and have stayed home since, and at times I feel useless and worthless because I'm not saving money, but then I remember my life is more important. I'm 25, so almost exactly your age, but I'm afraid of dying of the pandemic. So I stay home, and I also do it to protect others, and I remember that's more important. So it's not pissing the year away, think of it as noble and smart to stay home and do freelance work when you can.   As far as advice, I think waiting out the pandemic before trying to work is safest, but, I think you should use this time to work on yourself. Work on teaching yourself that you are worthy, capable, lovable, strong. I suggest getting into yoga. It's 100% free on youtube, Yoga with Adriene is the best one. I swear to you, this will help your mental health, it did mine for sure, and its free with no equipment needed. Just head to youtube. You can also look up free meditations, for deep healing and trauma, and it could help you rewire some things. Talking to people online and making online friends is really helpful too, to not feel alone.  I don't know what else to say, except that I genuinely believe in you, and I want you to know that all of these things you've been through have NEVER been your fault. Asking for cookies as a kid is something every child has the right to do and your dad being awful is your DAD'S fault and his fault ALONE. You are a capable and important human with every right to be happy and thriving, and I wish you the best. Again, please feel free to talk to me any time at all. [end]
[start] Well, I don't have tips, but I definitely can say something.  Your pain is very real, and I'll be damned if I don't know what it means to carry the wounds of the past with you, even if you don't want to. It's strange, like some sort of shadow that constantly robs you of the light you should be getting in your life.  However, there's a pretty good circumstance in all this. The past is, luckily, your past, and you're still here. You've gone through it. I'm not saying it's not going to suck, but you'll come across some oportunities to get closer to the life you desire eventually. Have patience, keep a cool head and keep track of your feelings (making a journal would be actually really nice). It seems like you've acknowledged your situation is bad, but not insurmontable. You're gonna have to make some pretty smart and complicated moves if you want to get your ID, driver's license and whatever back.  You've got a hard situation, there's no use denying it. You've still got a story to write, and it's out there. I don't know you, you don't know me, but I want you to know that you're stronger than you think. Always.  Keep it up. [end]
[start] first I must admire the courage you have to open up. You should be proud of yourself. Second having curly hair is a beauty and you are lucky to have it- from one curly headed girl to another.  Its sad that you had to go through what you went through. But remember don't blame yourself.   Everyday morning once you get up, remind yourself of why you are worth it and tell out loud everything you love about yourself while looking into the mirror.  You are your own person now and as mentioned in a few comments you don't owe anyone anything. Let your past go and don't let it define you.   As for what you can do, here are a few things. You could take up those free classes offered by unis online. Thing like coding and designing are very popular now. Once you have finished your classes, which shouldn't take more than a month utmost, you could start working online. Having a online store under a pseudonym could work very well. So you wont have a boss- ultimately working for yourself. You could also work as a group moderator, which again is an online (as to my knowledge) job.  Over everything else, don't give up. As I was reading your post I imagined you as a beautiful person and I hope that you know you are. If you did read this, im sending you a virtual hug. Dont give up and you can always send me a message if you ever feel like talking to someone.  Sending you my love.💕😊😃 [end]
[TITLE] Toll Enforcement Notice [TITLE]
[start] Im not sure about Sunpass. When I drove through Florida they sent a bill for the tolls.   Here in Illinois you're supposed to register the car to the transponder. That way if it doesent scan they use the license plate number to charge the toll.   If that doesent work yeah they will send something in the mail. Most states have 7 days to pay online before they start mailing notices try that. [end]

[start] Don’t let it control you/obsess over it. [end]
[start] Hugs. You must be very lonely. Your mind is probably feeling that lack and has started to paint it in. The illusion gives you comfort, but stress at the same time. I think there is no immediate cause for stress. But do realize that these illusions are not realistic. Life will be different than what you fantasize. It might still be good, ofc.  I don't think you're going crazy. I do think you need help. Not having friends means you don't develop the social skills to have a long lasting relationship. You need to get that experience. If you don't manage to get that from making friends, which sometimes happens, you need to find other ways. A therapist could help. I hope you will allow yourself to see one.  Take care of yourself.

And I'm not trying to convince you aswell, just take my word in perspective, I remember how good it felt to win arguments but in the end of the day, if you look closely for everyone's opinion will always find reason why they may foster it and if we lived a similar life we would be just like them. Live your life, stablish your moral code for yourself, do not expect people to live by your means of right and wrong, and let them be.  Have a nice day. [end]

[start] I am feeling exactly the same, i am 18 years old and i have always dreamt of Being finally mature. Unfortunately covid happened, i couldn't say Goodbye to my high school friends and i am slightly losing touch of them. I lost my girlfriend as well during this period. I had to celebrate my 18th birthday alone without my friends. I just wanna leave my home sometimes because i have the feeling that the most beautiful time of my life has been taken away. I am sorry, i don't really have advice but i commented anyway because i could relate to this. It's a hard time for all of us and it's not fair that covid Ruins everything for us but we have to stay safe. I am alsof definetely not a social person but all i want right now is to meet new People and have Fun with my friends and it is really frustrating. I hope you Will feel better and even though i don't know you, i believe in you [end]
[start] I understand it all, I had a future this year and a job with new relationships opportunities, but it all got canceled, but there have been good in this year, you just need to find it, I promise you this pandemic is not permanent, in the end we will prevail and find our paths once again 😊 [end]
[start] I UNDERSTAND this feeling, and I have started to feel the same way too a lot. I have a few close friends, but I dont see them nearly as often as I used to, and I just feel like I'm on my own a lot. One thing that has helped was joining fan communities online (that's partly why I made a new reddit account, because I just wanted to talk to other people). Even just browsing this subreddit and commenting on other people's posts can help me feel better for a little while.  I feel like I'm getting to the point where I'm ready to take advantage of the desperation. I am scared of talking to new people, but spending a few months in quarantine has corrupted my social life enough to make me feel like I might as well talk to everyone I see. I've been looking at r/socialskills a lot, and I feel like I want to go out and just talk to people (NOT to make friends, but just to hear them say something interesting). [end]

[start] Try for both. Expect neither because both are highly unlikely to happen. Get through high school. Get into college. Even community college. Find a subject you like. Work towards a goal. Try the other 2 in the background. [end]
[start] Unless you’re averaging 20pts on varsity and playing travel ball in the summer then just focus on school and do streaming and basketball until you can land a scholarship or your HS career ends or your rec league days end. [end]
[start] You should do what your heart wants, basketball will be good and a great future and friends, unless your rather be in it for money and fame, and gaming is great but there’s not much of a future in that, NBA that’s a big deal and very rare for someone to be interested in that, but this is your choice [end]
[start] Neither. I followed my heart and it got me nowhere. Follow the money. Wherever the money is at, go to college for that. If you hate that field of study, too bad. Your not there to like it, your there to make good money one day. Who cares what people think. They’re not going to live your life. Do what you have to do. Gather up your self-esteem and get to work. [end]
[start] I think do both and have fun.  If you're talking being realistic though, neither are.  I was super (well still am) in video games...before live streaming was a big thing I was making like video game videos on YouTube and writing game reviews trying to be a game journalist.  It never happened....but I had fun. Im just a software developer now. I actually made ( a very shitty ) website to post my reviews on and it got me into programming.

It sucks that he's making you feel this way, if you want we can dm about it and I can listen to some of your music and tell you what I think (I'm also a musician so we could even try to work together on a song).   Dont let somebody ruin your passions with their opinions, no matter what you're making there's an audience for it somewhere; and the fact that he hasn't listened to any  of your music definitely makes it feel like he just doesnt want you to pursue career in arts. A lot of parents are like that, they want their kids to be doctors or lawyers because it's a reliable job that pays well, but trust me, following your passions is much more worth your time. [end]

[TITLE] I[26F] can't convince myself to move out even though I know it will improve my mental health [TITLE]
[start] To quote shia labeouf, "Just do it!" You don't need any convincing, you already know it's for the best. You need to just do it.   Look, my mom has schitzophrenia ok? I lived with mentally unstable parents until I was 15, when my brother put me in a foster home. I didn't wanna move, but when I actually did it it was for the best, and now I don't even wanna contact my parents.  That's the thing. You're in a type of comfort zone, and you don't wanna get out of it- but if you're anything like me, you'd know doing stuff out of your comfort zone often yields good results.   So just do it. Do it now, whether you like to or not. Stand up for yourself. You'll be convinced that it's the best choice once it's done. [end]
[start] Yeah just move out and keep them at an arm's lenght.  You wont help anyone if you get mentally screwed. [end]
[start] Hey, I know its a big step. But you've already decided why moving out is the best step, now all you have to figure out what is preventing you from taking the final step.  I can guarantee, none of those reasons are worth staying, from what you've described, and from my own experience, but just take a little bit of time to think about it and process it.  Next, just start planning the process of moving out, you don't have to make the final decision right now that you are going to move out, but just try plan everything out, like think about where you would stay and all that. And actually try apply for a lease and shit. Cause once that stuff comes through, it will start to become a reality and not just an idea, and then the decision ill be much easier to make.   Maybe even tell yourself you're only moving out for a year if that will be easier on you... then you will be in a much better state to think about things further.  While you are stuck at home though, maybe try some meditation. Also if you wanna talk about it more idm [end]
[start] Just do it, it can’t harm you. Just make sure you have all the preparations for moving out. Check the attached link if you need to know what you need.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/how-to-prepare-to-move-abroad%3famp=true [end]
[TITLE] Go to therapy? I'd love to, but my parents don't pay all my bills. [TITLE]
[start] Some therapist work on a sliding scale. Meaning if you dont make a lot of money, you'll pay less.    I've only had one therapist, and I paid $35 each session. He didn't have some fancy building or anything, he had an office in a church. Still worked for my needs though.    I feel like therapy *is* about developing new/better habits, its not only venting. At least, not for me.    But I do agree, mental health services aren't cheap and it sucks, but that's just the world we live in. [end]
[TITLE] I'm underweight and have only myself to blame [TITLE]
[start] It’s hard to hear but don’t think about now.   It sounds cliche but you gotta do what will make your FUTURE self happy.     You ever hold off on something and in the future you tell yourself: “damn if I would of did it before, I would feel good this exact moment.”   Don’t let it be that way. Fight through and do what you gotta do now because boy I tell ya, the future isn’t as far as you think   If you wanna work on your body and you’re feeling discouraged, just do it!  Now for my experience:  Me and my 3 year GF seperated a few months back and I was down and depressed, no confidence whatsoever.   But guess what? I didn’t force myself to do anything. I took inspired action. So I sat on my ass playing PS4 eating all day telling myself “I’ll start running soon, I’ll start losing weight soon, I’ll start to work out soon” eventually I had enough of looking in the mirror wishing my body was the way it was once when I was more active. So I finally did it and I’m telling you, if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be able to give you this advice right now.    Just do it!  Let me know if there’s anything else you’re worried about   Edit: so basically, doesn’t mean just get up and change your life in an instant. Set an intention and make it strong enough that you know soon you’ll take action. Relax however long but don’t procrastinate. Just know that soon you’re going to be working on it and it’ll be natural very soon [end]
[TITLE] Today I remembered to trust my body, not the internet. [TITLE]
[start] Every time you check the internet symptoms the result is brain cancer.  - *caugh caugh* Let me check the internet.. - oh my god its a brain cancer!   So dont worry. Trust your body. [end]
[start] You might’ve just gotten lucky, imagine someone reads this and trusts their body(just like you) but they actually did have cancer and because of your comment they decide not to get it checked. They die from the cancer, whose fault is it. It would be all because you posted this thing. If you have the symptoms then you should go check it. It couldn’t hurt. After all, it’s better to be safe then be sorry later. Unless you’re in the us. You would need to sell your kidney just to get checked. [end]
[TITLE] Am I in the wrong? [TITLE]
[start] Yes, that is very creepy and intrusive to her privacy please never do that again [end]
[start] Yeah, sure. That TOTALLY happened. [end]
[start] Well first of all, this community is for those who need help and actually are willing to seek appropriate advice, second of all, that is top borderline creepy, you should never follow a girl home and not expect to get thrown in jail, that’s invading her privacy, please don’t post something like this here again [end]
[start] “Yes officer, this post right here.” “He will most definitely become a pedophile and stalker.” [end]

[TITLE] The subtle art of not giving a fuck. I’ve read the book but what are some useful tips and recommendations you all have? [TITLE]
[start] Keeping [a fuck budget ](https://www.blinkist.com/magazine/posts/need-fck-budget) [end]
[TITLE] Venting helps [TITLE]
[start] So my company got robbed early on when things were crazy, and as a fair result they reduced the amount of cash we have on hand to keep us safer. This means we haven't been able to break $100 bills because then we wouldn't have any change left, so we don't take them unless they are spending like $85+ (and safedrop them immediately), and some people are understanding about it. But we also get the assholes who say it's illegal (it's not) say we don't accept american currency (obviously not true) and that it's unamerican to refuse it. We also have SIGNS up explaining that we can't take $100s TEMPORARILY for our protection. All I've learned from this job is that most people are selfish, careless, and don't pay attention to their surroundings at all. I've gotten so much shit this year and it's just people being big babies over company policies. You must be a sad person with a sad life if you take your personal shit out on your local cashiers, who are nothing but nice and accomodating. It is depressing for me how many adults act like children when they are told "no". [end]
[start] Well that is awful, but they don’t get to decide if your happy or not, there’s rules and they need to follow them and if not then you can report them to your manager, I can already tell that your amazing, kind and very strong, use those to make your work day brighter 😊 and if allowed in your workspace let those people know that they don’t get to treat you like that [end]
[start] covid makes me more lonely than ever. I get really angry sometimes because it feels like i am wasting my life and my most beautiful years on this planet due to covid (i turned 18 a few months ago). I just finished highschool and i am losing contact with all of my friends. Also lost my girlfriend during this horrible period. Could not invite my friends over for my 18th birthday..Sometimes i just wanna run away and start a new life to still make something out of it, just start all over and leave the old life behind like it never happened..

[TITLE] Question about the Screenshot tool "LightShot" [TITLE]
[TITLE] Just a comic trying to make it. Would love some feedback!! [TITLE]
[start] i like it. esp the part about web.m.d. not a big fan of dirty comedy (graphic sex and murder) but you did a good job at making it funny. i know it is harder to do clean(er) comedy a la gaffigan and seignfield et al. but i feel more comfortable passing on those recommendations to friends and family.

[TITLE] Dog passed away last night at the vet. [TITLE]
[start] I'm so sorry for your loss. It sounds like you gave him an awesome, love-filled life though. [end]
[start] 13 is a long full life for a dog. It requires a caring owner for a dog to live this long. Hopefully you can take some comfort in knowing you gave him the best life a dog can have. [end]
[start] I am so sorry that this happened to you but you really shouldn’t blame yourself. You not taking him in earlier had no impact on the neglect of the vet in allowing your dogs feces to contact the surgical site. The site should have been covered preventing the infection and where he was being kept should have been taken better care of. You can not blame yourself for something that the vet clinic neglected. [end]
[start] Sorry for you loss. It is not your fault. He would never blame you. —I have sat thru the euthanization of several of our pet family members. And I’ve not been there for all. We can only do what we can do. What’s most important our the years we give, and that they give us. [end]
[start] I am so so sorry. I know your dog knew that you loved him. [end]
[start] I understand what your going thru I had a similar situation only with a 19 year old cat, now I have a dog for the past 6 years and love her to death, I will give her a little extra love just for you tonight, I am so sorry for your loss. [end]
[start] If it’s any consolation, he was probably very sleepy and did not feel you abandoned him. He drifted off peacefully. [end]
[start] I'll pat my cat for you tonight. 13 years is a long, happy life for the dog. You made the best decision you could. [end]
[start] You sound like a loving and caring owner. Your doggy was so fortunate to have you as an owner. [end]
[start] Sorry for your loss but it sounds like you really cared and gave it your best. It's easy to blame yourself and people do it all the time but it won't help and it's not true. Allow yourself some time to grieve though [end]
[start] You made the right decision with all the information you had at the time you thought this was best. If you would have did it the other way and he died you would feel guilty as well. Stop beating yourself up your precious dog would not want that. [end]
[start] I’m sorry for your loss. What I tell myself is that I gave them the best fighting chance possible. Snoopy doesn’t blame you.  On another note, that vet sounds negligent and uncaring. [end]

[start] It’s the kind of world we live in, we can live without money, we need a job and in order to find a job that makes us money and happy at the same time we need to figure out our strengths and weaknesses then our passions and our hobbies, then we connect those to the jobs that are available in the world [end]
[start] Hobbies,other interesrs, family, and friends keep me occupied....and having a career where I can do those things without worrying about myself like financially is nice.  Idk I've done the love and relationship thing and realized it wasn't that great as it seemed....  In the end I'd marry someone if it was the right someone...but I'm totally content living alone [end]

[TITLE] Do I need to stop saying actress? I was raised to say it, with no judgement intended as to the person’s talent. But now I hear people calling everyone actors. It doesn't come up much, but if I do say “actress” around someone who doesn’t, will they think I’m trying to be sexist or offensive? [TITLE]
[start] Stop letting language control your life. [end]
[start] Whuuuuuut I never heard of that. I'd also appreciate more info on this xD [end]
[start] As an acting student, we were taught to just call everyone actors if that helps aha [end]
[start]  We Thespians deride such poppycock. [end]
[start] Whaaaat [end]
[start] I'm an actor, this has been my experience working the business:  Many actors get offended at "actress" and think it is in the interest of equality to be called "actor", much like the change from "steward/stewardess" to "flight attendant".  I, personally, feel it's a little silly since sex is absolutely a determining factor in the casting of a role and I don't see why being female is inherently "bad"- but I understand that other's experiences are not my own and honor people's preferences, for gender pronouns as well.  If if doesn't cost me anything and doesn't hurt/disenfranchise others, why NOT respect someone's wishes regarding their personal and professional identity? [end]
