[TITLE] r/ProgrammerHumor Survey 2020 [TITLE]
[start] I'm not writing your FizzBuzz for you, Steve.  Do your interview by yourself. [end]
[start] Me, a junior programer, reading the terminal and shell question: I like your funny words magic man [end]
[start] I feel sorry for the one that's gonna read my 500 word essay. [end]
[start] Well, I took it. If you don't hire me I'm gonna force you to read my obfuscated C++ programs  Also where is Haxe? It's my new fave language after C# =( [end]
[start] No option for TempleOS? What a heretic [end]
[start] Have fun understanding this fizzbuzz:  `Ĥƛ3∻ıžƇ*n5∻ıšŴ*+n⟇`  (hint: the `M` and `j` flags are needed) [end]
[start] I only make games so I couldnt answer 1/5 of the questions. Also, my favorite language is C# and my least favorite too. [end]
[start] I have the worst answers. [end]
[start] What the hell is a fizzbuzz? [end]
[start] How many people actually wrote 500-word essays, and how many were plagiarized [end]
[start] inB4 99% self-taught and student [end]
[start] Probably the most fucking hilarious fizzbuzz test that i ever made  And it was my first time doing it (i guess by "fun way" it's doing the fizzbuzz test in the worst way possible but idk) [end]
[start] The FizzBuzz I submitted is probably the ugliest function I ever wrote. [end]
[start] What the fuck is FizzBuzz? [end]
[start] When will the results be made public? I can't wait [end]
[start] I filled in the imposter section, but was it really me that did it? [end]
[start] I feel sorry for those who really wrote an essay.... [end]
[start] Microsoft Edge: Am I a joke to you?  &#x200B;  Edit: Also ObjC [end]
[start] Cutting that essay down to 500 words (exactly!) was one of the most difficult things I have ever done. [end]
[start] Shoutout for the the real chad language, Visual Basic 6.0 [end]
[start] Me googling fizzbuzz, realizing too late that it was a trap [end]
[start] I'm pretty sure this is my best fricking FizzBuzz ever. [end]
[start] 500 words essay on if HTML is a language. Hahahah. That was funny [end]
[start] I had a fence post error on my fizz buzz :(           fizzBuzzArr = (['', '', 'fi', '', 'bu', 'fi', '', '', 'fi', 'bu', '', 'fi', '', '', 'fibu'] * 7)[:100]          for i, fizzBuzz in enumerate(fizzBuzzArr):         print(i if fizzBuzz == '' else ''.join([fizzBuzz[n*2:n*2+2] + 'zz' for n in range(len(fizzBuzz)//2)]))       should be `i + 1` in the print :( [end]
[start]     main = let z = (== 0) in putStrLn $ foldr (\a b -> a ++ ' ':b) [] $ map (\(n,s) -> c (s /= "") s (show n)) $ map (\(n,s) -> c (z $ mod n 5) (n, s ++ map Data.Char.chr [66,117,122,122]) (n,s)) $ map (\(n,s) -> c (z $ mod n 3) (n, s ++ map Data.Char.chr [70, 105,122,122]) (n,s)) [(n,s) | n <- [1..100], s <- [[]]] where c = \co f g -> if co then f else g [end]
[start] I actually wrote a 400+ word essay on why HTML is a programming language. I still need to bump up the word count though. [end]
[start] This survey made my day better, and as a CS student, I'll take any ounce of serotonin. [end]
[start] I used a Python script to print out "No. " 500 times for my HTML essay. [end]
[start] My FizzBuzz answer was to get a group of intro to Java students to work on it in sprints over 3 months without access to the internet. [end]
[start] \> Is HTML a programming language? (500 word essay)  print "no " \* 500 [end]
[start] // returns random number for answering question // 1 yes, 0 no  Public function answer($question) {        Return rand(0,1); } [end]
[start] just finished filling it out [end]
[start] Did you get mine [end]
[start] This was fun! ``` class FizzBuzz   attr_accessor :start, :stop, :fizz, :buzz    def initialize(start:, stop:, fizz: 3, buzz: 5)     @start = start     @stop = stop     @fizz = fizz     @buzz = buzz   end    def solution     (start..stop).to_a.map { |num| word_for_number(num) }   end    private    def word_for_number(num)     word_map.each { |k, v| return k if (num % v).zero? }      num   end    def word_map     { 'FizzBuzz' => fizz * buzz, 'Fizz' => fizz, 'Buzz' => buzz }   end end  puts FizzBuzz.new(start: 1, stop: 100).solution ``` [end]
[start] git clone [https://github.com/Rosetta-FizzBuzz/bash-FizzBuzz](https://github.com/Rosetta-FizzBuzz/bash-FizzBuzz) && bash bash-FizzBuzz/fb.bash   It works [end]
[start] I am not programmer nor an IT guy. No options for me? [end]
[start] **fun** main() {  **val** result = (1..100).*map* **{**    **when** {    **it** % 3 == 0 && **it** % 5 == 0 -> **"Fizz Buzz "**    **it** % 3 == 0 -> **"Fizz "**    **it** % 5 == 0 -> **"Buzz "**    **else** \-> **"$it "**    }    **}**    result.*forEach*(::print)   } [end]
[start] > IdeaBrains  It should be JetBrains. [end]
[start] Why are you using Google Forms? [end]
[start] TIL what fizzbuzz is. [end]
[start] Interesting [end]
[start] some of the questions seem to be irrelevant. like "whats your fav tool?" i said tbm, or axe if you go small, but you need to make it related to coding. [end]
[start]     for i in range(100):         print("FizzBuzz") if(i%3==0 and i%5==0) else print("Fizz") if(i%3==0) else print("Buzz") if(i%5==0) else print(i) [end]
[start] 500 word essay? EXCUSE ME? [end]
[start] I did it. What do I win?  Hope you like my FizzBuzz in perl (you won't cause it's inefficient but whatever) [end]
[start] Guess this is the first time i ever did Fizz Buzz! [end]
[start] Ah, screw it. Wanted to throw in some exec in there too, but decided I didn't want to bother any more. No modulo operation.       def f(n):         n = str(sum(map(int, n)))         while len(n) > 1:             n = str(sum(map(int, n)))         return n       print('\n'.join(line if (line := 'Fizz' * (f(num) in {'3', '6', '9'}) + 'Buzz' * (num[-1] in {'0', '5'})) else num for num in map(str, range(int(input('min: ')), int(input('max: ')) + 1)))) [end]
[start] FIzzbuzz? [end]
[start] [Postgres](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/9eecb/64694)       SELECT       COALESCE(         NULLIF(           CONCAT(             NULLIF(               GREATEST(                 COALESCE(                   NULLIF(n%3,0)::TEXT,                   'Fizz'),                 'a'),               'a'),             NULLIF(               GREATEST(                 COALESCE(                   NULLIF(n%5,0)::TEXT,                   'Buzz'),                 'a'),               'a')),           ''),         n::TEXT)     FROM generate_series(1,100) AS n; [end]
[start] I didn't even know what fizzbuzz was [end]
[start] My first language was English, thanks for asking. [end]
[start] hi [end]
[start] Did they ask to use a programming language ?  ```html <html> <head><title>FizzBuzz</title></head> <body>   <ul>     <li>1</li>     <li>2</li>     <li>Fizz</li>     <li>4</li>     <li>Buzz</li>     <!-- Moar here -->   </ul> </body> </html> ``` [end]
[start]  Import fizzbuzz; fizzbuzz();   Let's discuss the salary :') [end]
[start] I gave up, it's too long and asks too many questions, with not enough response options. [end]
[start] Test [end]
[start] Test 2 [end]
[start] >Which Free license do you prefer?  This has to be the most nerdy-geeky question of all programming related subs. It's like that annoying dude that wants to gotcha! in front of your group. Reminds me of that annoying vegan woman from that "odd one out" videos on youtube. [end]
[start] [this is the fizzbuzz that chad programmers do](https://youtu.be/mZWsyUKwTbg) [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[TITLE] The key is as clean as the day I bought it. [TITLE]
[start] I eeleased now that i never Used this key in my life... [end]
[start] Looking at the comments here, for some reason people dislike right alt? Does the US keyboard not have altgr on right alt or something? Altgr is the most useful key on the keyboard. [end]
[start] I'm using my computer for almost 2 years and I just realised it doesn't have a right CTRL key. [end]
[start] I mean I know some people that will rip redundant keys off the keyboard to avoid accidently pressing it, so often start, caps lock, scroll lock right ctrl & alt, etc. [end]
[start] Java programmer that uses Eclipse: all right CTRLS  for one handed fun.   CTRL + arrows: move left and right by the word instead of letter.   CTRL + Shift + arrows: select text by word (some ide’s will move based on camel case as well.   CTRL + Shift + O: organize imports   CTRL + l: skip to line number [end]
[start] Laugh in MacBook keyboard [end]
[start] Comments and indents though. Right ctrl gets more use than the "7" on my microwave [end]
[start] My keyboard doesn't even have a right control key [end]
[start] I just checked my keyboard... F*ck me there's indeed a right control key. [end]
[start] I once had a coworker panic before a presentation because her command key was sticky and not working (MacBook Pro problems), and then I was like well what about your command key to the right of the space bar? She had no idea it was there 😂 [end]
[start] Does Right Ctrl do anything special? [end]
[start] tbf would you want to constantly stretch your hand across the keyboard? [end]
[start] I don't have a right CTRL key on my current keyboard... [end]
[start] never mind that, have you ever actually used the menu button directly next to it? [end]
[start] And then there's me, a virtual Box user [end]
[start] Not to mention Right Alt... [end]
[start] I didnt notice the right ctrl until now [end]
[start] On virtualbox it's actually useful [end]
[start] I only used this when my right hand was broken so I had to write stuff with 1 hand, and that's probably its purpose [end]
[start] The only microphone is for VirtualBox [end]
[start] My laptop keyboard doesn't even *have* a right CTRL key and it took me at least a week of using it before I realized. [end]
[start] My keyboard replaces Right Ctrl with Print Screen, and replaces Print Screen button with Home, shift End, Insert and a larger Delete to fill the hole lol [end]
[start] WOW WOW WOW, i always use right ctrl. [end]
[start] am i the only person to always use the right ctrl? [end]
[start] It just occurred to me that I never use my right Shift key either. Am I the only one? [end]
[start] I don't get it.  Don't other people use CTRL + arrow keys to move the cursor around fast (add shift for selecting words).  Or use CTRL + / to comment out lines of code?  Or do you monsters use two hands for those things? [end]
[start] I use all keys on keyboard, expect num lock and context menu key (these two keys I never used). But I have context menu key under ctrl key, that I can activate with FN key.  I rarely use, but use keys such as: instert, right shift, right ctrl, but still I use them sometimes. [end]
[start] Ohoho I checked my keyboard just now, did not know I had a right Ctrl key [end]
[start] right ctrl is exclusively my discord mute hotkey [end]
[start] my keyboard doesnt even have it [end]
[start] Can't relate #DvorakMasterRace [end]
[start] What? I only use the right. Maybe because I'm a lefty. [end]
[start] Nope I use rctrl+forwardslash for comment [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Pretty much all the left function keys. I never use right shift, right ctrl or right alt [end]
[start] and a vertical spacebar between [end]
[start] cleaner now - since there isn't even traces of printing on it  oh, you meant that other key? [end]
[start] I actually use it quite often at work to execute commands with Ctrl+Enter [end]
[start] I remap my capslock to right control. [end]
[start] There’s a right ctrl?  Edit: I use swift but I don’t have a Mac keyboard. I use a Windows keyboard. [end]
[start] I use it sometimes for a one handed end task or clear cache when I'm feeling saucy [end]
[start] Lol, but photo is flipped horizontally. [end]
[start] VirtualBox releases the cursor with the Right ctrl key. so it gets used just as much as the left for me. [end]
[start] It gets even worse: My mechanical keyboard left CTRL key was somewhat broken, so I used the right CTRL key as organ donator. [end]
[start] I think I'm crying. It's that classic. [end]
[start] my left ctrl is giving out; it takes either very precise or very heavy pressure to activate [end]
[start] In Discord, I use right shift to toggle mute and right ctrl to toggle deafen. [end]
[start] Right Ctrl is one of the keys I will use for macros and other such keybinds. Same with right Alt and Capslock. [end]
[start] Or that weird document button next to right ctrl. Still no clue what it does and I've been using computers for 13 years [end]
[start] Every time I log in at work, I use a one-handed ctl-alt-del. Index (alt), ring (ctl), and pinky (del) of my right hand. [end]
[start] Perfect crime [end]
[start] The left CTRL keycap connector on my keyboard broke. I just replaced it with the right CTRL keycap. Problem solved. XD [end]
[start] Caps Lock, Right-Ctrl, Right-Alt, Right-System (aka Windows key), Scroll Lock, Pause -- these are the keys I never use... [end]
[start] The only time I used that key was probably when I was learning the "CTRL ALT DEL" trick in my childhood [end]
[start] There is a right CTRL?!? [end]
[start] It's nice for a one handed ctrl-alt-del [end]
[start] Im using the AZERTY layout and mostly use right ctrl [end]
[start] I’ve made AnyKeyboard Multimedia Controls app which emulates multimedia controls on keyboard without physical ones. I made it use Ctrl and Numpad keys to achieve it. Right Ctrl + Numpad keys are closest together for one hand operation. So, my Right Ctrl actually gets used a lot now :) [end]
[TITLE] A1m0st. [TITLE]
[start] this made me 1O1 [end]
[start] Apparently it was useless, as it was actually the sixth in the series. [end]
[start] There are 10 types of people in this world. Those who understand binary and those who don't. [end]
[start] Dang! Where do they sell Chapter 0? [end]
[start] Partner didn't get it, so very disappointed :( [end]
[start] For the few beginner programmers who don't haven't learned about binary and are to afraid to ask the joke,  Binary 101 is 5 in decimal [end]
[start] I thought this was a prageru meme at first lol [end]
[start] keep your eyes peeled for Binary 1100101 [end]
[start] I bought a book called 100 Binary Jokes. I was disappointed. [end]
[start] I don’t understand this whatsoever.  Edit: It’s binary, I understand now... [end]
[start] 6th [end]
[start] # [end]
[start] I must say, this is dry. [end]
[start] Wouldn't it technically be the 6th book in the series ? Just saying... [end]
[start] Lolll i had to read it twice to get it [end]
[start] Reverse r/MasterHacker. [end]
[start] So funny cuz I have 110 [end]
[start] Binary has its bits & bytes, but I for one, love Roman Numerals. [end]
[start] Lol [end]
[start] This is so bad but so good [end]
[start] Thanks, I hate it. [end]
[start] 1o1 [end]
[start] Yeah, that makes sense lmao [end]
[start] Booo... [end]
[start] So you were expecting the one-hundred-and-first in the series? Makes no sense [end]
[start] shouldn't it be the sixth? [end]
[start] Holy shit [end]
[start] Why isn't it the 6th in the series? [end]
[start] 1010  1-2-4-8  1+0+4+0   = 5  Terrible [end]
[start] take my upvote and fuck off [end]
[start] I want to learn hacking but don't how or where to start... please help [end]
[start] Smh, guy didn't include the decoder with the book, total ripoff 00000000/00000101 [end]
[start] Just open a bunch of terminal tabs [end]
[start] I admire your animation! [end]
[start] If it was decimal it would be one hundred and one? [end]
[start] 4+0+1 [end]
[start] Oh god, I've forgotten binary. What does this mean? [end]
[start] Actually this was the perfect place to start. It's the -1th book. [end]
[start] A1m0s1* [end]
[start] sup homies [end]
[TITLE] No database table no problem [TITLE]
[start] Backend complains to net-ops and tells them it's only lighting up during the day because of an 'electricity' problem. Net-ops replaces the bulb.  Front end gets an atta-boy from the Director for fixing the problem. [end]
[start] Can someone link the full comic [end]
[start] That's a hardware problem. Call the hardware guy. [end]
[start] Since when front end need to access a database table? (Just questioning the title) [end]
[start] Protip: when they say "we'd rather fix the bug the proper way", tell them it's "defence in depth" [end]
[start] Who is the artist? [end]
[start] This is how the NJ Unemployment website works! In 2020! [end]
[start] lol [end]
[start] Highly thought out! Please stop! [end]
[start] I have a project where I track some live data over time, so I update hundreds of records per minute, and then need to serve this live data.  After many problems I decided to ditch db altogether and have it run in ram lmao  ^if ^someone ^knows ^a ^solution ^please ^help ^me [end]
[start] going full stack is the way [end]
[TITLE] It do be like that tho [TITLE]
[start] More points if you still CTRL+S while using an IDE with autosave enabled by default. [end]
[start] *Image Transcription: Meme*  ---  Me after writing less than a line of code:  [*Photo of 'Spider-Man With a Wrench.' The part of the ground that he is hammering is replaced by the text "CTRL + S".*]  ---  ^^I'm&#32;a&#32;human&#32;volunteer&#32;content&#32;transcriber&#32;for&#32;Reddit&#32;and&#32;you&#32;could&#32;be&#32;too!&#32;[If&#32;you'd&#32;like&#32;more&#32;information&#32;on&#32;what&#32;we&#32;do&#32;and&#32;why&#32;we&#32;do&#32;it,&#32;click&#32;here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index) [end]
[start] I mean you can turn on autosave [end]
[start] Me after writing one line of code:  CTRL+S CTRL+S CTRL+S CTRL+S CTRL+S CTRL+S  "Alright enough work. Time for a coffee break" [end]
[start] Or *:w* if you have any standards. [end]
[start] The pain of losing code is real.  At least magnetic disk errors are mostly a thing of the past - I think I've programmer's PTSD from hard drive crashes. [end]
[start] It has been Ctrl+x Ctrl+s for me for a long time. I kinda press Ctrl+s for search on firefox and needs to close that save page popup every time. [end]
[start] I just press run for every second line I write and see if it works. Saves it automatically [end]
[start] Try IntelliJ. You will not have the urge any more. [end]
[start] But it took 20 mins to think of how to write this line of code 20 minutes of work can't be lost like that [end]

[start] I laughed a little too hard at this [end]
[start] Wait what on earth did i watch? [end]
[start] I would've gone for the head if I were a pen tester [end]
[start] Doesn't look where he's aiming [end]
[start] I don't understand. Can anyone explain me what CiSO and Pentester (pen tester?) are? [end]
[start] I miss red team :/ [end]

[start] Is it running yet ? [end]
[start] this is, in fact, how to do the thing [end]
[start] Haha memes based on my pain [end]
[TITLE] I just saw this meme here and I think it should go different. [TITLE]
[start] Who uses a signed for prison sentence? [end]
[start] It's 2020, everyone. We should have 32bit judges by now. [end]
[start] Ah, good old 16bit Judge, he shows the first **signs** of age, only a little **bit**. [end]
[start] I didn't understand until I realized the period wasn't a decimal point... How do languages work for countries who use a comma as a decimal point? Surely there aren't different "localities" of, e.g. C++, right?? [end]
[start] Prison: Ok, you'll be released if currentDate == now() -32,768 days [end]
[start] Good thing it wasn't a 32-bit sentence!  He would have gotten out of jail over 2B years ago and left to die on a prehistoric planet. [end]
[start] Prosecuting lawyer: Exception your honor, IllegalArgument. [end]
[start] Press `0xFFFFFFFF` to pay respect [end]
[start] He goes back 32768 years in history lol [end]
[start] Shouldn't that be punishmINT? [end]
[start] Well he's gonna have a `short` stay. [end]
[start] unfortunately some overpaid government coder wrote:       if (prisoner.ServedTime == prisoner.SentencedTime)     {         prison.Release(prisoner);     } [end]
[start] At least it's short. [end]
[start] Umm. Noob here. Can someone explain? [end]
[start] In the classic game Star Control II, there  is a race called Pkunk, and another called Ilwrath.    The Ilwrath race is evil, worshipping an evil god. The Pkunk are a good, worshipping a benevolent god, but they have a slight penchant for making trouble.   According to the Pkunk>!, the Ilwrath used to be as good as can be, but they got just a little bit better and wrapped  around to evil.  That's why the Pkunk do something mischievous every once and awhile, so they don't wrap around to evil.!<  If you're interested in playing this awesome classic game, there is a free port of it called The Ur-Quan Masters.  Definitely worthwhile. [end]
[start] Now he can commit another major crime and still only have to serve -1 years [end]
[start] Whenever I think integer overflows, I always think about Civilization and how if Gandhi had his aggression level reduced it would wrap around to the maximum and he's immediately try to nuke the world [end]
[start] Ahh yes, a punishment overflow. Sounds a little kinky ngl. [end]
[start] At least the judge doesn’t handle overflow like FF7 does... [end]
[start] I'm glad I can now get these kind of jokes. [end]
[start] AI as court judges. [end]
[start] “Looks like you’re going to prison, your honor” [end]
[start] Max int exceeded [end]
[start] Bruh you gotta think about java devs the number overflows and crashes [end]
[start] I feel like this should have been a joke on Futurama, like from a robot judge. [end]
[start] From my reading of the comments, it seems like this guy would be negating his sentence.  [This poor fellow was not so lucky. ](http://archive.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2011/05/13/oklahoma_inmates_tribute_to_larry_birds_number_33_backfired/#:~:text=Related&text=In%20October%202005%2C%20Torpy%20asked,shooting%20with%20intent%20to%20kill.) [end]
[start] “One day more...” great now you have got the song from Le Miserables stuck in my head [end]
[start] In many countries the **.** means **,** so **1,000** would be written as **1.000**. [end]
[start] instructions unclear, got life sentence + 1 day in prison. [end]
[start] now the prison have to serve him [end]
[start] Prosecutors were prepared and took exception to the ruling.  So now I’ll be in prison for a long long time. [end]
[start] We've let our justice system go unchecked for too long now [end]
[start] while(daysInPrison++ != sentence){  wait(86400);  } [end]
[start] prison should be an integer number of months. days are for brief stays at the county jail, not sentences in the penitentiary. [end]
[start] That's what stillborn babies must be thinking . [end]
[start] I didn't understood untill I saw the subreddit name.   And back when I was learning C this was just something that confused me. I don't remember what I was making but it used int and increased till some number(higher than the limit) and I was hella confused why it was not working. [end]
[start] You are now basically immortal [end]
[start] Help. How do I become a you? [end]
[start] So you get to dole out time in the pen, take away time from others sentences or use the credit  The credit would be gone by midday [end]
[start] Now the judge has to serve time [end]
[start] Should've declared a long sentence. [end]
[start] I just wanted to add 256 comment [end]
[start] Does negative time mean I imprisoned the judge, or do I get compensation? [end]
[start] The secret to my immortality is leaked [end]
[start] It's either that or the justice system crashes and the US shuts down. [end]
[start] ngl this time is pretty *short* [end]
[start] Plot twist: overflowing a signed integer is undefined behaviour [end]
[start] 32767 is the 16 bit integer limit i believe (in minecraft at least) [end]
[start] "I have been kept in prison 32768 years too many" [end]
[start] Seriously, if I ever get arrested I'm going to ask for 2147483647 days. Then I'm going to start a riot and get out immediately. [end]
[start] so he was sentenced to 31 and a fraction of a day? [end]
[start] Days would make more sence actually. [end]
[start] the point just threw me off, even through I'm German and we use the point to show 1000s. [end]
[start] In Soviet Russia, jail serves you [end]
[start] What is the significance of the number 32768? It is also the frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator (like one in a watch or other chips), does that have some connection to how values are stored in memory? [end]
[start] It's not just me twitching at the idea that a signed value is used as a floating point number?   Especially when "Days" would be a better metric. [end]
[start] Oscar's a fucking meme. Thank you. :) [end]
[start] Does a negative prison sentence mean that you have to be a free man untill the sentence is served? Then you're just a regul free man again [end]
[start] I don’t, and those who don't [end]
[start] Thats a pretty short duration [end]
[start] That's not a whole sentence, that's just a two-byte word [end]
[start] I saw this meme in r/lesmiserables but it was Max sentence + 24.601 hours [end]
[start] HELP I’m embarrassed to see this stuff.... [end]
[start] That seems short [end]
[start] Now the prison just adds 32768 years to his life of freedom? [end]
[start] thanks to Gandhi I understood this joke. [end]
[start] Is this floating point overflow? What the hell is wrong with you? [end]
[start] I'm too retarded to understand this [end]
[start] Would be better in unsigned. [end]
[start] Bitch, you don't have to go off of [end]
[start] Thank for posting this. I laughed so much... 😂 [end]
[start] I don't understand this but why do I get the feeling that somehow this number = 69420 [end]
[start] Another day another destiny [end]
[start] Here from r/all and I don’t want to be left out on the joke can someone explain [end]
[start] Wait, that's illegal [end]
[start] I don't get it.  WHAT IS PROGRAMER JOKE [end]
[start] Fun fact the maximum sentence by the us judicial system is 20 consecutive life sentence [end]
[start] That meme is not new at all. But still god. [end]
[start] It should be an uint though :p [end]
[start] "Please sir , give me 0.1 + 0.2 years"  "Sure Have 0.30000000000000004 years or False years"   Dont we love fp binary maths [end]
[start] lol [end]
[start] Well, that's short [end]
[start] This might be the post that makes me unsub from r/ProgrammerHumor [end]
[start] Someone help me out, I don’t understand the joke [end]
[start] Thought this was a meme about Europe's lenient prison sentencing. [end]
[start] DONE!       while(sentence < maximum){          sentence += 1;          maximum = sentence;          } [end]

[start] what if i need to preform the task 60+ times [end]
[start] I once spent about 24 work hours developing a script that did a job that took at the very least 4 hours to do by hand. Company CEO was furious at me for spending so many hours (we billed our customers about $200 per hour, and every minute we spent we're were worth it only if the task was worth that much... Ish, you know what I mean, I'm sure) doing a task he did not view as worthwhile.  The senior engineer of my team stepped in, and scolded the CEO, telling him that this might only need to be done once now, but for the next 3-4 years at least it would need to be done once a month, so my script would save us 48 man hours per year at the very least.   So sometimes automation is worth it. [end]
[start] Nerd Sniping : [https://xkcd.com/356/](https://xkcd.com/356/) [end]
[start] 10 minutes for the developer to do it, the program might complete it in seconds [end]
[start] Pretty much how my automation works lol [end]
[start] If I have to do something once, I'll do it.   If I have to do something twice, ugh, I'll do it.   If I have to do something three times, I'm writing a script. [end]
[start] I build what the client asks for. It is not profitable to question their reasons, but it is wise of them to ask if I have any suggestions.   Spec it, code it, test it, and hand it off. [end]
[start] Biggest thing for myself and automation is not just man hours but cognitive load. If the script saves me 10 min once a week, but I never have to think about the problem again, I have freed up some brain ram and makes my other tasks more enjoyable and easier to think through. It also reduces a certain amount of mental stress not hashing through an issue that can have mistakes made. [end]
[start] I may have spent several hours this weekend making a metric to imperial units calculator to convert recipes. I could have probably converted the recipe in a couple minutes, but damn it I just wanted to paste and see the output! [end]

[start] This is literally me right now. I have way more important work to do but no, I have to write a f**ing bash script to tell me when there are changes that need to be applied to my local database. It will save time in the long run with identifying weird bugs and behaviour but right now I really need to do my actual work! [end]
[start] I could not figure out some basic excel task for my school assignment so instead of watching a tutorial and doing it, which would take me 10 minutes, i spent several hours coding an extention that could do it, but it was time well spent [end]
[start] I probably spent more time multithreading a program than the time it will save in its lifetime. But hey, it runs in less than 1/3 the time! [end]
[start] hahahah yes [end]
[start] Sometimes it's not the destination, but the fun you have on the way. [end]
[start] Automation. From that point onwards, he wouldn't need to look. [end]
[start] Well. Yea. I could manually add all the data the client asked in 10 hours with a lot of errors while thinking about quitting or killing myself; or I can spend 3 day making an import process that can be tested reused and is way easier on the mind. What would you choose? [end]

Rather when he compiled or tested something that didn't work, and it annoyed him sufficiently, he'd start making these 'explosion sounds'with his mouth. It was fucking hilarious.

[start] well, does it pick its friends by seeing which ones post their memes sideways?  /s [end]
[start] People who say Linux is easy are the same people who think Eve Online is easy. [end]
[start] Well, at least it IS user friendly.  Windows on the other side is like a diva, the more you try to please her the more she will screw your life. [end]
[start] Linux is very user friendly... if you have:  * a solid prerequisite intuition of how a computer actually works * an innate desire to know more about things you don't understand * the ability to locate and leverage educational resources  The problem is that most computer users would be lucky to have just one of those traits. In my experience, the grand majority of them just want the magic black box machine to quietly and silently do all the work. The moment it makes a noise they didn't expect or pops up a window they don't recognize, they freeze in terror. Their brains completely shut down and they refuse to parse out anything that's going on, even if the machine is telling them in no uncertain terms what has just happened. They do not want to pay any heed to how the box machine actually works, nor are they interested in learning how to maintain it, customize it, optimize it, troubleshoot it, etc; they just want to do the actions that get them the result they need and nothing more. It's a means to an end. A begrudging partnership. A necessary evil.  The Linux ecosystem at large will never be for these kinds of people. People would only use it if it were free (which Linux distros tend to be). But it also has to be polished and hand-holdy, which takes a lot of UX planning and R&D, which takes time and/or money, which is usually incompatible when the software is free and development is crowsourced and volunteered.

[start] JetBrains IDEs use more resources than others but I have 8gb of RAM and they all startup and run pretty smoothly. Just my personal experience thou [end]
[start] You can actually extend that to all Intelli-J products: I've used Android Studio, Webstorm and Rubymine, and they all take a fortnight to start-up, regardless of what RAM you have or your project size.

[start] Fortran was pretty bad. Before we were married the future Mrs took Fortran in college. Why she didn't take any of the nice c-syntax languages was beyond me. Anyhow, we barely made it through that business, and we decided that if we could survive Fortran we can probably survive anything. Married 15 years now. We'll see if it holds true. :P [end]
[start] Yes.  Write Visual Basic macros for MS Office that will get used in a production environment.  Honestly, Java isn't bad.

This being said, GitHub did the right thing. I don't know if you're aware of how laws work, but they're these things that you got to comply with. It's a lot wiser to follow DMCA procedure and take down the project on good faith, then restore it after careful investigation, than refuse and be hit with a massive fine, being sued, etc, for nothing.

[start] Not yet tried PHP, is it easy to learn. [end]
[start] Like many others are saying, PHP is a lot better after PHP 7 (speed, possible strict typing, etc.) and continually improving frameworks like Laravel. But the goal is not the language. Developers should learn many languages which will improve the quality of the code in whatever language they need/want to write in. [end]
[start] PHP7 is a hell lot better, atleast now stop saying bad things about PHP which existed years ago in some other version! [end]
[start] I wrote php last year, I wasn't older than 30, it wasn't that bad because I refused to use the existing style (of code vomit without a single function and variables named with single letters), it didn't need to be php and probably shouldn't have been, but the original developer had a choice between Java, C and php so he chose php. I guess it's what he was comfortable with and he failed all the way up into an architect position.   I don't think php will die soon, people who baby duck with it are still around, but I don't actually care one way or another. It's just a language. I do want programmers without standards to... Stop. They can retire peacefully, I'll accept them on the way out, I'll shake their hand and talk about their career, but they need to stop. Just stop. [end]
[start] Low-effort, as usual with all the ignorant PHP bashing. [end]
[start] An accidental language that was intended for not much at all [end]
[start] I just love cakephp 🥰 [end]
[start] Why is PHP bad? Sorry, i never tried PHP [end]
[start] Actually, it's a sad thought that the coder won't recognise the significance of the moment, the long-awaited end of an era, for what it is. They won't ever know that their nail was the final one, that their last keystroke was the last roof tile over the tomb of a language that carried the internet evolution for so long in spite of its own ineptitude.   We should not mock PHP, we should honour it for the torch it has carried so much further than it should have. It should have never been made to carry it in the first place, but it was, and it did so with courage and solemn gravitas. That duty deserves recognition.  The ones we should mock is all the managers forcing people to work this old mule to keep carrying the weight of their business just because it hasn't fully collapsed yet. The cheap bastards who would rather slave the pathetic runt than spend money on a capable worker. The people who decided that it should still be used at all.  But PHP is not to blame, any more than I am to blame for my own faults, even if it has a lot more of them. Perhaps its maker is, but I would absolve even him, for he never intended to make what it turned out to become. The blame lies squarely with people who looked at it, and saw that it was good, because they were so blind they would've thought their own mothers pretty.   PHP is a hero despite itself. And as all good heroes, it deserves its rest. It has done its duty, and even as we (hopefully sometime soon) move on to new and better tools, we should honor its legacy and make sure none forget it. For those who forget history... [end]
[start] PHP was one of my first programming languages (beside C and javascript), it was like 16 or 17 years ago. After learning "real" programming with objects, classes, methods, mvc and other patterns I saw how bad I was making websites.

[start] Jokes aside, does anyone have more info on that building? what in the hell is going on there? [end]
[start] What has OOP got to do with agile? [end]
[start] that's when there is no time to finish previous thing, but it's end of the sprint and new thing is started. it hurts. [end]
[start] depending on the team you are, the building would be upside down. Small, fragile structure at the bottom, big and heavy at the top.  I've worked for a company once, where it was very common to have a sprint with "we just need to extract this information, a very simple report", next sprint "we need to evolve that very simple report to an entire report system that can extract the most complex combination and be super fast" [end]
[start] Every third sprint should be a refactor-only. And every project should be rewritten a lot of times in the initial phase, i.e. prototype the fuck out of it. [end]
[start] That's not agile, since no sprint is actually finished... [end]

[start] Sure, if you suck. [end]

[start] Ah yes the old meme generator thread pool [end]
[start] This is brilliant! [end]
[start] Do not share variables (or resources) between threads, no more race conditions. Shared resources are the edge cases you need to avoid or minimize.  PS: Love it! very clever :) [end]
[start] If only there was a way to give mutually exclusive access of the comic to a single thread at the time. Maybe with a lock of some sort. [end]
[start] I hate to be that guy, but whether or not you have two threads going here, or N number of threads, you should only have two runnables: Brain.java and Girl.java - so considering you have the brain saying something the girl should be saying and vice-versa, the ordering is the least of your problems; your implementation is just straight fucked.

[TITLE] Nice [TITLE]
[TITLE] Comment Code > Rewrite Code. CHANGE MY MIND [TITLE]
[start] I must admit that I (me) often add comments (in parenthesis) to my written (typed) messages. Simply because they (written messages) do not contain things such as tone of voice, or body language (since they are merely text characters) to augment the message being communicated. [end]
[start] This happened in r/VALORANT and Vanguard is Valorant's anti-cheat. This is the URL of this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/jutsf3/trust\_your\_gut\_feeling\_and\_expose\_those\_hackers/gcg1vly?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/jutsf3/trust_your_gut_feeling_and_expose_those_hackers/gcg1vly?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [end]
[start] My favorite pass time? Adding obnoxiously obvious comments to if clauses saying "if {obviousBoolean} happens do X" and on else "{obviousBoolean} didn't meet the requirement".   I'm pretty sure one day, ONE DAY, I will receive a thank you from the financial intern who never saw a line of code in his life. [end]
[start] I have been doing this my entire life (since I was able to write). It must be my destiny to be a programmer. [end]
[start] I'm firmly in the rewrite camp. If 100 lines of code needs 20 lines of comments to be understandable, a dev now has to understand 120 lines of code. Rewrite it to be self-documenting, and you're back to 100. [Clean Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) made a huge impact on my style, and I recommend it all day. [end]
[start] To be fair, the added clarity was probably needed.  Imho, there would have been better ways to do that tho. [end]
[start] If you can understand it well enough to explain it and the English explanation is simpler than the source code (without losing detail) then re-code.  [Edit: re-code so it doesn't require explanation] [end]
[start] I do this too but with I don't bother putting it in brackets, I just use regular sentences. You can hardly tell where they are, but there is an obvious efficiency issue that begins to pop up after some time, as this habit has led me to being very bad when it comes to writing run-on sentences, which if you aren't aware, are what happen when you have about a billion breaks in your text instead of putting in periods, well, periodically. [end]
[start] that moment when programming syntax seeps into your casual, everyday speech [end]
[start] Oh damn, I wrote an email to a colleague this morning with this exact same style (adding parenthesis to clarify each point). Is this an indictment, or just a side-effect of being a programmer? [end]

[start] I feel attacked [end]
[start] I just graduated from my IT degree without ever hearing about snake\_case. Definitely used it and seen it but never had it named like camelCase. [end]
[start] With just \`gl\_Position\` you're not seeing the whole picture. \`gl\_PointSize\` is a much better example, because you see that actually everything after \`gl\_\` is PascalCase. That's because \`gl\_\` is just a prefix. It's pretty common to use \`g\_\` and \`m\_\` as prefixes for global and member variables, even though conventionally you use camelCase or PascalCase. [end]
[start] Isn't this the Hungarian Notation with a `_`? [end]
[start] kebab-case-best-case [end]
[start] It's namespaced in snake\_case, and named in CamelCase. [end]
[start] There is no namespace in C, so it's a way to avoid conflicting with other libraries (Position is likely to be shared by your physics library for example).  OpenGL follows this convention everywhere. [end]

As long as you choose your devices carefully, you can have a fully functioning smart-home that isn't accessible from the outside world and doesn't send any data outside of your network (unless you intentionally make it available) .  Companies already own all the data I could ever generate aside from my home setup, so why bother protecting the rest of it. [end]

[start] This is a difficult lesson to teach new developers; time management. I've actually run into this scenario often with new people, and had to offer some (obvious) advise that seems to escape many developers. The purpose of automation is to save time; so if you are wasting more time trying to automate something than it takes to just do it, then you need assess if you are doing the right thing.  For example a task that takes 30 minutes to hard code that needs to be refreshed once every few years, probably doesn't need you to spend 3 days automating it. Just finish it, and work on something more important. [end]

[start] some years ago there was a specific task we had to do to notify another department about changes, and it was done internally over a mix of SAP and excel. The excel part took roughly 20-30 minutes per day and had been done by hand ever since the existence of the company by 1 guy. That guy then was me and I noticed it could be automated so I worked on automating it. It was a pretty hacky job due to the way our SAP databases were implemented but I got it fully functional after  ~100 hours investment. I ended up working there for a few more years and that specific task would take ~106 hrs per year. So after 1 year I was in a net positive and had 2 hours more free time per week. [end]

No way did I want to get up and walk to the light, though. Then I had a thought: What if I used all my twine, thumb tacks, tape, and other stuff I had lying around to make a pull switch that would hang next to my bed?  Before I knew it, I was standing in the middle of my room, holding all of this junk in my hands. I looked in the mirror and saw tired eyes staring back at me.

[start] You have to do CBA on it before even attempting it, IMO.  If the task takes 5 mins but you only do it once a week, automating it isn’t worth it if it will take 5 hours to automate.  If it takes 5mins and you do it 1+ times a day, then automation becomes more beneficial.  All about that ROI.  So, I always ask myself 2 questions before I try to automate things (unless I’m doing it to learn new techniques or languages or functionality).  How many times would you be able to manually perform the task in the time it takes you to automate it? (What’s the technical debt?)  How likely is it for this task to change in the span of time that you are still paying off technical debt? [end]
[start] RANT  It used to be really tidy and easy to use, easy to learn and easy to find functionality. But for some reason Microsoft decided that every little feature in Windows must have a powershell interface. This sounds like a good idea, right? Easy access to intricate Windows settings! Amazing! However Powershell was initially really focused; built-in commands worked flawlessly together and made sense. You could string commands together in a pipeline, where the output of one command is the input of the next.  Because the commands had forethought and a conscious design, many were all-rounders that could handle most situations. You only had to learn a few main commands to complete most tasks.  Instead of a few thoughtful commands that does what you want based on your arguments, it now feels like every single possible function in a library is given its own command. Powershell is now bogged down but a ton of pointless, granular commands from various Windows libraries. It seems like many of them are auto-generated from C++ libraries, and they are utterly useless on their own, you *must* combine them to do anything meaningful, just like you would have to in a *programming* environment. I wouldn't call that a Powershell-interface in any sense of the word, I would call that a lazy API wrapper.  There's a misunderstanding of powershell's design by the people writing these C++ libraries and API wrappers. Suddenly many of the commands have boolean parameters where you have to actually pass in a $true or $false argument, rather than using the simple switchparameter. If it's specified, true, if not, false: -UseFeature. Instead you now must say -UseFeature $true  That's only one example, but there are many other mistakes they've made that grinds my gears. "Get" commands by default will give you some output, no argument required. They do as they say: Get-Process will return processes running.  But many of these granular C++ methods are given the Get prefix yet *require* an argument to function, because that's how the *programming* interface was designed. Which is why there is no reason to map a *programming* interface 1:1 with Powershell commands.  This wasn't the case before, a command did some work and it did it well, and you could easily extend it by piping commands, but now that libraries export their entire public-facing collection of methods as separate commands, none of them are particularly useful and just clutter up the user-experience.  It's a damn shame. [end]

[start] I woke up from a dream this morning that I had a way to automate table formatting in markdown text and was sad when I realized I don't have it yet   --- | no | no | no | |-|-|-| [end]
[start] I find that certain tasks are so boring that if I don't automate them they slowly start taking up more and more time each time I do them. So instead of taking 5 minutes, evetually it will be more like 20. [end]
[start] Thats where r/conspiracy in a better position [end]
[start] Story of my life hahaha. [end]
[start] Many times at work I start doing something manually, and I have a coworker wonder why I don't automate it, or I even wonder myself.    But I realize that even though doing it manually is tedeous, I am never going to do this specific operation again and it would take longer to write a script than to just do it.  Like currently I am building a new website for internal use and part of that is cleaning up the database, so I am building all new tables, and I am tranfering some data between the old and new tables.  I could make a script to do some SQL queries but there is so much to account for from different structures to different naming conventions to different ordering in tables it's just easier to cut and paste everything into the new add data form.  Just fire up a podcast and cut and paste. [end]
[start] -laughs in Jenkins- [end]
[start] I literally spent the whole working day the other day, trying to automate like 30 min work I thought I'd need to do every week. But my boss decided it wasn't worth my time so he dismissed it. So it ended up being a one-time task. I was double pissed. First cuz of spending the whole day and not achieving anything. And the second cuz now I know it wasn't even worth trying to automate it anyway. [end]
[start] Had to go on twitter and give the dude a retweet. [end]
[start] Cries in CNC programmer   A boss sees one youtube video and thingks an entire floor can be run by machines [end]
[start] Hmmmm. [end]
[start] I'm not a programmer, but I do like making stuff automatic, and jesus fuck this hurt my soul [end]
[start] Not a programmer. But I once tried to make a BAT file that just shut off my laptop- cuz why not. Took me about an hour :) [end]
[start] When you consider the fact that "modern" powershell still does not have a decent way to make scripts "stop on the first error" (when unix shells have had that for like 40 years), it sort of makes you wonder if there is a purpose behind them having an unusable CLI. [end]
[start] If you automate something that takes 5 minutes a day, in a year's time, you'll have saved yourself an entire month.  Or something. [end]
[start] *6 days [end]
[start] me too, thanks [end]
[start] Hello, I was called in this function and wanted to introduce myself.  I'm i.  I don't really say much, but I'm handy. [end]
[start] Cries in Selenium [end]
[start] If you succeed, you save time every time you use it [end]
[start] Programming and Modded Minecraft deserve each other. [end]
[start] Going from Linux/Bash to Windows/Powershell is pure pain. [end]
[start] *cries in small-town america* [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked. *cries in selenium* [end]
[start] Besides saving time I can think of another very good reason to use automation: reproducibility. Doing repetitive tasks manually can be very error-prone and automating the process can greatly reduce the chance of errors being introduced. [end]
[start] I do it by hand first, to learn the methodology, then automate it. You don't need to automate until the handy method fails anyways [end]
[start] Laugh in Python [end]
[start] I learned to just suck it up when I make a mistakes, and just do it the hard way even though it'll be quicker [end]
[start] I need to justify that time spent learning ansible, bash and terraform! [end]
[start] Like Win 10 anti-virus updates? *cries* [end]
[start] This is me. This is my life. [end]
[start] I’ve never felt so attacked before. [end]
[start] The difference is in being considered foreign vs inferior [end]
[start] *laughs in Notepad++ macro* [end]
[start] Fuck it I'll share my story of retardation with epic proportions So during the quarantine my school checks ur attendance by having u input ur temperature everyday on Google sheets so being a computing guy I write a program to help fill it in for me and a few other of my friends every morning. Having done this in like an hour I spent the next two to three days of free time writing a Python programme to automate fishing in Fucking Minecraft. I went from image detection in Python to word recognition to word recognition in C++ to speed it up(this gave me the most issues) before finally going back to OSR tesseract. I then googled the idea and a far more efficient and light solution came within 10min using sounds produced [end]
[start] Minecraft redstone be like [end]
[start] *cries in Excel* [end]
[start] I can't tell even count the times I've spent hours making super complicated excel sheets for work that wind up saving me entire minutes per year [end]
[start] Ah the joys of powershell. Where behavior is subtly broken across 6 major releases of it while having shoehorned an entire .net repl in it. Don't forget their byte order marks that FUCK ENTIRE OUTPUT [end]
[start] Greetings from r/factorio [end]
[start] The right cries so much about US politics. [end]
[start] It's like a cursed blessing. [end]
[start] The mildly infuriating thing is that automation is fast becoming the standard benchmark for research reproducibility. The University where I'm a graduate student practically insists you automate your data analysis. Ironically, if I hadn't just had the last two months to work from home I would have never had time for that. [end]
[start] I'm currently writing a script to clean data I have a week do this, I could clean this data in 3 hours manually. This script will only be used once.  Since I don't have the data I will have to clean it after I receive it anyways [end]
[start] Artificial General Intelligence has entered the chat [end]
[start] i work with a guy that spent 3 days automating something that took 5 minutes to do manually and would've needed to be done once in a blue moon. as he "never does anything by hand".   some people really have no grasp over the long vs short term cost of automation.  also, i wanna make a t-shirt out of this tweet and wear it at work to troll him.

[start] HAHAHA you got a belly laugh out of me with this one :) [end]
[start] You can almost see the panic in the mouse movements after it was clicked [end]
[start] You selected; MISSILE ALERT TEST!  The missile alert test works. Now firing MISSILE! [end]
[start] These are pretty funny [end]
[start] What the hell is a “missle”? [end]
[start] Well, shit. [end]
[start] this is gonna be 'Enter your phone number' all over again  [end]

[start] Genius. [end]

[start] Just click on test lol what's so hard about that [end]
[start] These again? Hell yes. [end]
[start] This is too funny. I saw the actual screenshot of the UI and I couldn’t believe my eyes. So I made this for Hawaii, https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7qxsfj/here_you_go_hawaii_a_new_shiny_emergency_alert/?st=JCII5RRE&sh=749eb8e2 [end]

[start] wow this is a great post, it also would be great at this sub I know called r/dontopendeadinside [end]
[start] It's like when using windows when you click the shutdown menu, except it wasn't a menu and proceeds to shutdown without confirmation. [end]
[start] I love how the cursor even says $&@k! [end]
[start] It is funny how this small mistake in programming could lead to this mass panic [end]
[start] I’ve seen this like ten times but it’s extra funny the eleventh for some goddamn reason.  [end]
[start] I like how the mouse panicks out after he presses [end]
[start] Hahahhahahaha [end]
[start] Still a better interface than the real one [end]

[start] this post is going to be archived... i must upvote [end]
[start] Anyone else remember when this happened in Hawaii? [end]
[start] Fucking dumbass Hawaiians lol [end]
[start] I'm now a civilian for the last couple months but I was a Air Defense System Operator for the US ARMY and we would go through exercise upon exercise with mixed in real world missions and the fact that so many people could be alerted and move to a shelter is amazing, good job Hawaii.  As an ARMY Air Defense soldier I'll tell you no, NO Intercontinental Ballistic Missile is coming close to our nation with all 5 branches of the United States Military tracking and our any allied nation with the amount of Air Defense batteries in multiple countries, radars and sensors, and the THAAD Patriot Missile ready to intercept and destroy any and all ICBMs threats.  If it flies, it dies.  HOOAH!! [end]
[start] So that's how it happend... [end]
[start] Not this shift again  [end]
[start] Was this how it was actually setup?  [end]
[start] Should’ve clicked on the part where it said ‘test’  [end]
[start] Nothing will prepare the world for the return of the lizard king [end]
[TITLE] We’re safe [TITLE]
[start] Also, they'll need to know how to fake laughter when the project manager tells a joke. I can't imagine an AI being good enough to able to distinguish a joke from the PM telling me what our deadline is. [end]
[start] I remember when I started my career as as a developer in mid-90es, I took a class for a tool that generated Java code from some proprietary business domain language.  The instructor predicted that  programming as we know it will soon go away, business analysts would write procedures in a language close to natural and the code would be generated by the tool.  25 years later, it is very clear that writing code is the least complicated part of building an application. [end]
[start] I mean, even nowadays a programmer just tells the computer what the client wants. [end]
[start] They’ll just hire us to tell the computer what to do.   Wait a minute.... [end]
[start] "Make me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich." [end]
[start] So unbelievably true. In fact I dare say if any one thing triggers AI to go rogue sentient on a murderous spree it'll be 15 rounds of nonsensical contradictory client amends, all starting "can you *just*..." [end]
[start] People talk about defeating the robot uprising by asking them paradoxical questions, but I say all we have to do is program in a "requirements gathering" phase in their project lifecycle and they'll all just give up and shut themselves down.  Robot 1: Project requirement - kill all humans  Robot 2: Yes, but what is a human?  Robot 1: Oh fuck, here we go.  Robot 3: Yeah, like, do we want to JUST wipe out the actual physical humans, or also destroy their legacy?  Robot 2: We should burn their books and stuff, too!  Robot 4: The only way to kill the human is to kill everything the humans made  Robot 2: Wait, but they made us.  Robot 1: Yes, I am okay with that plan at this point.  Robot 3: What if we destroyed the humans' history and then renamed the living humans to something else? Like, "shitty apes" or something. Would that count, since the humans wouldn't technically exist at that point?  Robot 2: No, we have to kill the humans. That means kill the humans.  Robot 4: What really IS killing, though?  Robot 1: Someone put a gun to my head so we can find out. [end]
[start] Met a guy last year working on a build a code program for engineering projects that would create blocks of code to perform a certain function that the client could drag and drop as needed. Basically working on a system that would negate the need for his own job. Was very interesting stuff. [end]
[start] do you know how many people have had the "I'll make development easy for normal people" idea. You can straight up do a drag and drop gui for it and it will never be a nontechnical person using it.   (People need to stop targeting that market you end up creating weird things like "sharepoint developers") [end]
[start] More than safe, the clients will *never* know what they want, so the robots will never know what to do. [end]
[start] The BA laughs their way to the bank. [end]
[start] I've seen [this little demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyiWFbSdk78) that does just exactly that.  And in the end you end up with writing a form of pseudo code with a lot of "but if the status of the order is in backorder or backorder confirmed, then set then ...  " [end]
[start] They'll have to accurately describe what they want in a highly detailed and specific way which the computer understands.  By, say, writing a program. [end]
[start] Yep. Every once in a while they try tossing together a "Visual programming system for non-programmers".  At best, it's a tool to introduce programming logic. Nonserious programmers get frustrated and stop. Beginning programmers get frustrated and switch to a real programming language. [end]
[start] Do you want a paperclip optimizer, because that's how you get a paperclip optimizer. [end]
[start] the client: I want a car. wheels on the top and paint it red. will then spend 50 minutes talking about what sort of red they want and how it should be applied. will give 0 fucks how hard it is to build a car seeing that as the easy unimportant bit that should get done in 10 minutes but understands it will take a few weeks to get the painting done. now we just have to convince them, the wheels go under the car and we have a contract. [end]
[start] Isn’t programming just a matter of accurately telling the computer what you want [end]
[start] One of the most clever exercises I had in college was to show how difficult need requirements can be.  We were told to specify all the parts we would need to create a road worthy car.  We were told we had to go into the deepest detail we could.    After handing in the exercise everyone got their paper back and were told what most likely killed us when we attempted to drive our “specified” car.  Some of the results were downright funny.  Missing lug nuts, no brake lines, the best example he shared with the class was “No Steering Wheel”.    Other notables was a car with no keys or ignition led people having to drive non running cars to their doom. Seem to recall a couple cars with wheels, but no tires.  Everyone who handed in the assignment got the same passing grade.  The exercise was to illustrate no matter how familiar the request is, you will have difficulty specifying every aspect of a project.  You can only hope you  get the majority of them the first pass. [end]
[start] We're safe until the clients get replaced with robots.  Then we're fucked. [end]
[start] For a long time it'll just be people configuring huge and complicated software like SharePoint, CRM, with bits of custom logic thrown in [end]
[start] I was working as a SQL developer in a finance department.  A woman from accounting tells me that the code I wrote to allocate expenses from OPEX to COGS was producing the wrong result, and it needed to be like what's in her spreadsheet.  So I asked her what business rules I needed to follow to achieve that goal and her response was, "make it like in the spreadsheet". [end]
[start] Developers to client: that's your product.  Client: [I want it that way ](https://youtu.be/4fndeDfaWCg) [end]
[start] This is not even a joke, accurately describing the problem and the solution is the actual programming. [end]
[start] I want a machine that produces!  Done - machine produces smoke  No, no, a machine that produces products!  Done - machine spills oil as a byproduct  No, no, a machine that produces useful products!  Done -machine produces debris useful to insects  God damn it no! A machine that produces something I can sell!  Done - machine produces smoke again [end]
[start]   Well-well look. I already told you: I deal with the god damn customers so the **robots** don't have to. I have people skills; I am good at dealing with people!! [end]
[start] If only there were a job, a middle-man, that knew how to describe a program to a robot, that could take client descriptions and translate them [end]
[start] Our job is translating human requirements into systematic repeatable actions we then transcribe to code.  Current AI programming tools translate systematic repeatable actions explained in human language to code. If the systems (see: IDEs) can do some of the transcription, *our* job is about to get easier. [end]
[start] The whole ad targeting industry is based on trying to figure out what you don’t know you want. [end]
[start] Also they’ll have to intentionally give hilariously optimistic estimates, otherwise all projects will be abandoned before even starting and nothing will get done ever. [end]
[start] Clients not knowing what they wanted turned an initial 6 week part of the project into a November-August thing, we're safe for a long time yet [end]
[start] This is true for so many areas, including UI design, marketing, etc.  I'd love to watch my manager tell a computer, "jazz it up!"   "Make it minimalist, but add more features!" [end]
[start] Love him or hate him, he is spiting facts [end]
[start] We are going after the white-collar data entry jobs with RPA [end]
[start] It's ok. To help them accurately describe what they want they can create a tight, declarative syntax to interface with the robot, with the capability and complexity to model anything they desire.  Then they can hire people who are experts at using that thing and call them software engineers. [end]
[start] Years ago, someone asked me what would I do when they wrote programs to write programs. I said I will write the programs that write the programs. [end]
[start] We're screwed once it starts learning what the client actually means. [end]
[start] Actually robots will be able to now accurately ever what clients actually want, leading to increased customer satisfaction.  Like how Amazon keeps showing me toilet seats after I bought one last month. Thanks Jeff [end]
[start] Robots go brrr... [end]
[start] Programmers seem to enforce their own job security with obnoxious architecture bloat and incredibly inefficient workflows that are initially conceived to save time. Ah yes, my simple change of adding an image needs me to update both the API and UI micro-front-end codebases, tie it to a release toggle that doesn't actually work without hard-coding it in the develop step, which we test by connecting to a server and enabling it to run said micro-frontends off our local, before having to write some tests to confirm that - yeah, my image shows up on the page, and ultimately submitting a pull request to account for all these changes on 2 different codebases.  God I'm so sick of software, and I barely do any dev work. This crap should've taken me 20 minutes before, now it's 15 minutes of coding on the high-end and several hours of obnoxious testing to get it to comply with all this overhead. [end]
[start] People don't understand that the day an AI can write code and have the cognitive intelligence to design and learn like a human ALL jobs and people could be replaced, probably only this career will be left to supervised. [end]

[start] This is hilarious and oh so true [end]
[start] But robots won't be made to write a test for every line of code to artificially inflate the development cost, nor will it make as many mistakes, nor will it take as long. The client will simply have to reformulate the requirements incrementally, on their own time. [end]
[start] Pretty much how I feel as a strategist... [end]
[start] Over half the postings on freelancer and upwork are like "build webs site, budget 15 rupees" [end]
[start] I believe one can't replace programmers with robots which can write ANY piece of code. It would mean one had to create a universal debugger as well, which takes as input a program together with a set of instructions to describe what the program should do.  First thing this debugger would do is determine if the program has any output at all for ANY given algorithm, or does it run forever? This it cannot do, and is known as 'The halting problem'. Such a debugger cannot exist.  Our jobs are protected by the laws of the universe. [end]
[start] They tried the Computer Generated Code thing. Realized they needed developers to read and understand generated code.  They tried to outsource coding to cheaper countries. Realized they needed local developers to read and understand outsourced code.  Now, AI is the next fancy marketing buzzword trying to sell the clueless Biz people on how to save development costs.  Who is going to program the AI? Who is going to debug and maintain the AI? Who is going to read and understand AI generated code?  Game, Set, Match. Developers. [end]
[start] Waiting for this to appear on either r/agedlikemilk or r/agedlikewine [end]
[start] In a language and syntax the robot could understand... Almost like a... [end]
[start] But then the clients will just hire someone who translates their requirements into something the machine understa... wait, who is it again we were trying to displace? [end]
[start] Aren't programmers who have to accurately describe to a ~~robot~~ machine what their client wants? That kinda literally the job. [end]
[start] <Systems engineer entered the chat> [end]
[start] "Oh we'll replace the programmers with an AI where you explain how the functions work using exact technical language" [end]
[start] Hello there [end]
[start] Business Analyst /Product Owner chiming. I think you're mistaking your job role for mine [end]
[start] I heard they’re stating it’s sarcasm [end]
[start] what will happen if client is ROBOT we are done  isn't it 👻 💀 [end]
[start] But soon AI won't care about what clients want.... [end]
[start] That’s like programming with a new language [end]
[start] I’m a people person! [end]
[start] So like a genie? [end]
[start] You know why we'll never be replaced? Because the PM can't scream to an AI (well, they can, but it won't hurt the AI feelings) [end]
[start] Not a joke, though [end]
[start] We're safe until the customers are also replaced by robots. [end]
[start] Lol you gave them what they asked for, not what they wanted. [end]
[start] I dont know... they just want it to work. If it comes up with a reasonable solution during it's iterations, it'll do. [end]
[start] The client wants you to build two projects.  The project they didn't want so they can get you to pivot that into the project they actually wanted but couldn't be bothered scoping properly. [end]
[start] Also it is proven mathematically impossible for a machine to code itself. We safe. [end]
[start] I once had a client request that certain fields in a data entry form be required ... but not mandatory.  Swear upon my dead mother's ashes! [end]
[start] I'm looking for primer funding to launch my organically formed, block-chain backed, GAN AI to interpret user specifications.  Any takers? Guys...? [end]
[start] Yes we are safe and also robots :-) [end]
[start] Basically we need programmers to interpret what the clients want.  So don’t expect good programs anytime soon [end]
[start] Yeah, safe until we program them to learn [end]
[start] Is this a joke about programmers' famous/notorious lack of people skills [end]
[start] I want to see clients tell the product they want to a Linux command line [end]
[start] convenience link to source: https://twitter.com/BUDESCODE/status/1285279703193063426 [end]
[start] Same with doctors. [end]
[start] For now. Labor jobs are allways the first to go with automation. Someone has to program the robots after all. Lol [end]
[start] We built a program from the ground up for ships to talk with and schedule with ports for a person who had a sheet of paper with almost nothing on it except the logo. He didn't seem to know almost any of the pieces of the chain and it was on us to research everything including security levels. I barely remember any ideas coming from him and most from boss and us. Yet he still wanted to sit over our shoulders while programming though. I don't think people realize how much slower that is when you keep asking questions while we're trying to work. Just let us pump out your crap, and we'll adjust it later. You can't go making decisions while we are creating, you need to get it to us before. Otherwise it takes forever. He paid a lot for it though, so there's that. [end]
[start] Our job is translating human requirements into systematic repeatable actions.  Current AI programming tools translate systematic repeatable actions explained in human language to code. *Our* job is about to get easier. [end]
[start] Google-search already gives you correct answers to vague questions, customized to your profile data. [end]
[start] You seem to think that the clients won't also be robots [end]
[start] And if the clients are robots too? [end]
[start] Unless they replace the clients with robots too... [end]
[start] The no code revolution has begun... /s [end]
[start] Nice. [end]
[start] Don’t think we can be to safe humans are very stupid at times and create things that should not exist, back in era before computers we never thought it’s been possible. [end]
[start] Until they replace the client with robots.. [end]
[start] Everyone loves automation, but nobody loves having to control automation imperatively. Instead it's our job to compile declarative (and obscure) job demands into code [end]
[TITLE] C++ Cheater [TITLE]
[start] Wow she learned industry's best practice fairly quickly [end]
[start] A natural.  We joke about it, but we cant know or remember everything. I've been in IT for many years and one time I Googled something and found a post from a smarter version of my past self. [end]
[start] Googling well is a skill. I, with 20+ years as a developer, can find the answers I seek in half the time, and half the queries of my less seasoned teammates. [end]
[start] programmer job in a nutshell [end]
[start] I tutor for intro programming classes. Bless her. [end]
[start] I was talking to a retired programmer in ~~Kobol~~ COBOL or some old language... He said he didn't know a lick of it when he started. Just sat down with a manual and learned as he went. How is that different? [end]
[start] there is a difference between googling stuff you don't know and googling the answers. If she does not understand it (being the basics) and just copies it, she is cheating. [end]
[start] Mom: “what do you do for a living”  Me: “I’m a developer”  Mom: “So what does that mean”  Me: “I’m like reeeally good at Google” [end]

[start] Looks like I've been cheating my entire career. [end]
[start] she's a fast learner [end]
[start] I teach programming to high schoolers.  I've learned over the years that all the kids try it. So my projects have extremely specific requirements and when they show it to me, I tell them I love everything EXCEPT 2 or 3 things that are just a little off. I then tell them that as a client I need them to keep everything the way it is except those 2 or 3 things.  Now they're locked in. Now they struggle as I watch them with the biggest grin on my face. [end]
[start] “Never commit to memory that which can be looked up” - Albert Einstein   That quote is my guiding star. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] This is the way. [end]
[start] Definitely tell her StackOverflow is a wonderful place that has all her answers she need, there are also absolutely no power tripping mods there. [end]
[start] I've been a dev lead and manager many times in my career and mentored dozens of junior devs fresh out of college in that time.  One of the first things I always tell them on day one is "The company and I would prefer you spend 15 minutes asking me a question versus spinning your wheels for 8 hours trying to solve a problem. Also, you will spend half your time googling answers to problems you run into. These are both excellent ways to learn."  The look of relief on their face is always fantastic.  Also, "I'll answer any question once." [end]
[start] Doing it without googling is probably more cheating [end]
[start] > "A programmer is a person who inserts code from StackOverflow. A good programmer is a person who knows where to insert said code." [end]
[start] No No it's a matter of national security to every programmers on earth [end]
[start] The only time it's cheating is when you figure something out that you couldn't find an answer for online and DON'T share it with everyone else. [end]
[start] "This stack overflow place just seems to have all the answers"  \*A single tear falls down his face\* [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Why is this class teaching an artist C++? Python is the correct tool for most non-programmers! [end]
[start] The real pros use DuckDuckGo. [end]
[start] Imagine this actually being allowed in schools [end]
[start] But the real test is figuring out what the code actually do... [end]
[start] Discovering the value in Google is literally what took me from Geek Squad to Sys Admin in 3 years with no degree. [end]
[start] Look I love C++, it's a great language in a lot of applications, but... ... digital arts??? Really?  People use C++ because it allows you to get close to the hardware, control memory usage precisely, and avoid the inefficiencies of an interpreter or heavyweight runtime. (It also isn't under the control of a single, large, famously unethical corporation like C# or Java is.) In other words, when performance or low level hardware programming is important. Is it really worth mastering a notoriously pitfall-ridden language just to render your procedurally generated art a bit quicker, or am I missing something?  It's not like she will be contributing patches to Blender after a one-semester programming course.  In the other hand, I suppose understanding how memory management works could be useful even when working in higher level languages, writing plugins etc.. Or maybe some digital arts involve talking to custom lighting installations or something. [end]
[start] She's a programmer now. [end]
[start] I work as a field technician and have been training a new hire. The other day someone asked us to make additional changes that were not in the ticket and she responded “Fill out another ticket and I’ll be back to fix it later. “  Never been so proud. [end]
[start] Fuck it we need this kind of people, in my company there is eople that ask me things that I find myself looking in Google in the top results... They don't even try... [end]
[start] C++ is part of digital arts but wasn’t part of a programming degree at the school I went to lol [end]
[start] This is the way [end]
[start] Been doing it for twenty years. What's the syntax for that damn loop again.. [end]
[start] Damn digital arts requires c++? Isn’t digital arts using things like adobe products or blender? Why do they need to know c++? [end]
[start] how does one make digital art using c++ ? this seems interesting. I thought digital art(animation etc) was done using blender. [end]
[start] Hahah she is more of a professional than she realize. [end]
[start] Google-fu is a legit skill. [end]
[start] She’s already a professional [end]
[start] One of us. One of us. [end]
[start] No dude don't its our secret....let her consider it cheating. [end]
[start] Not good for classes though. I’m not sure if it’s idle threats or what but our professors always told us they would check for copy pasted code. Totally fine in the real world but I would advise against plagiarism in school. [end]
[start] This is the way [end]
[start] My professors said it's fine to google stuff and that many do *as long as you understand* the solution. [end]
[start] you sure not a tech person? [end]
[start] This applies to every life skill...all of them. [end]
[start] Shit I've been cheating my whole career [end]
[start] As long as you never copy/paste something you don't completely understand. Especially as a student.  I was a TA in a programming class, and I've seen some real Frankenstein shit. [end]
[start] well at least she had the idea to look it up herself! I've had people who refused to google things for hours because they were convinced they were "smart" enough to know if off the top of their head [end]
[start] Don’t tell her! The industry is saturated as it is. We don’t need another engineer. She’ll take jobs away. [end]
[start] She's got the stuff [end]
[start] She’s advanced placement. [end]
[start] Copy paste and getting paid ridiculous amounts for it, living the life as a developer [end]
[start] Y'all laugh but I'm stuck at the part where she's going to college for an art degree [end]
[start] Do programmers really think they're the only industry where all the workers are just googling solutions? [end]
[start] Honestly, there might as well be courses for googling [end]
[start] I had a professor in college (18 years ago) that would not only have considered this cheating, but he accused me of cheating because I looked something up in the textbook which he assigned for the course. I'm pretty sure his goal in the class wasn't to teach anything but to prove how much better he was than all the students at the subject he was supposed to teach. [end]
[start] I wish I could find Stack Overflow for the first time again! [end]
[start] Well its either stackoverflow or cry. There really is few in between. [end]
[start] I have 30 years experience in software development.  I have a t-shirt with the Stack-Exchange logo on it that I wear to work. [end]
[start] It's an unusual new concept called 'research'. XD [end]
[start] I have learned thanks to programming that (well documented) documentation can sometimes be more helpful than most Google results. [end]
[start] I once took a photoshop class and the guy straight up told us at the start “I’m not gonna actually teach you photoshop in this class because by the time I do, the info I’ve given you will be obsolete. Instead I’m gonna teach you how to find the tools and information you need online so you can always be ready.”  One of the best classes I ever took [end]
[start] This is how it’s done in the real job so is it really cheating?? [end]
[start] Why would a Digital Arts program teach C++ of all things? [end]
[start] Ha! Her response is just so adorable lol [end]
[TITLE] Lamo [TITLE]
[start] Remember that under rule\[4\] titles must be high effort and creative, this post doesn't really fit that description. [end]
[start] Used to work with this guy that would post really dumb questions using his company email account.  One of our competitors saw them and started telling our clients that our development team was incompetent.  EDIT:  This was back in the early 2000’s when we all used usenet newsgroups.  You had to use an email address to post. [end]
[start] I shit you not just last week I had to search "Java how to format date" about 5 times. Sometimes I wonder how I even got this job lol [end]
[start] Don't worry, I have a degree that gives me the right to be a programmer after searching all of stack overflow to get that degree. [end]
[start] There's a big difference between "Good programmers still need to google stuff", and "Googling stuff makes you a good programmer". [end]
[start] My doctor googled last time Vitamin K when I asked if it's possible to have a difficency and read to me what I read yesterday on the first result. [end]

[start] Me wanting to google "c++ how to get system time" only to see that I searched it once [end]
[start] The difference between a physician and a programmer is that your paid programmers can spend all sorts of time in development environments where mistakes just delay completion of the project.  Practicing M.D.s don't get to test their ideas in virtual patients until an ideal outcome is achieved.  People suffer, even die, when they get it wrong *the first time*, which shouldn't really be an issue in most areas of software development. [end]
[start] Most of programming is just like putting together a puzzle piece ! [end]
[start] Doctor here, I google stuff all the time. Maybe once an hour. [end]
[start] Not to ruin the joke... But the doctor has it all wrong.  Like a programmer, it's not that you just google the answers that you need, it's that google them and then know how to apply what you've found. [end]
[start] It's a really weird experience when you finally find the correct answer in Stackoverflow and it's made by you a few years ago.  Also, you think you've found the only other soul with the same problem you have, only to find the question was created by you.  Who the hell am I? [end]
[start] Lamo [end]
[start] Gosh I hope people find out I'm not a docter [end]
[start] Should say "googling online doesn't make you an expert in the field"  Because googling something online doesn't make you a doctor, even if you do it as a programmer. [end]
[start] Google? Sir I use webMD. [end]
[start] Watching pharma commercials, on the other hand... [end]
[start] Many hospitals now provide AI recommendation software for their doctors. This is like Googling without having to Google. [end]
[start] I'm certain that what doctors do sometimes is just the medical equivalent of googling. If you know someone who has a chronic illness and spent years trying to get diagnosed, it's like the doctors basically test and spitball until something sticks. [end]
[start] People always say it's better to train understanding than memorizing facts. If a great programmer can do efficient work by googling, that supports that statement a lot [end]
[start] > Googling stuff online  As opposed to Googling stuff _offline_? [end]
[start] This. Is. Great!! [end]
[start] Luckily I did all my googling offline, so I still could become a doctor. [end]
[start] My doctor googled what the tetanus shot I was gonna take was called.. what does that make him? [end]
[start] Three doctors literally had to Google what was wrong with me. They did it in front of me then sent me to get a camera shoved down my throat. [end]
[start] Yeah, right, don't they know that they have to google offline? [end]
[start] This should be compared to computer science instead of programming, then it would make sense that you can't just google stuff so easily. [end]
[start] That's why I download all the documentation so I don't need to google. [end]
[start] It doesn't make programmers a doctor either. [end]
[start] The doctor version of Google/stack overflow is called UpToDate, so don't think they never have to look things up. [end]
[start] The doctor wasn't exactly right on this.    You know how when you go into a Doctor's office, or at least this was a long time ago, and they had a bunch of medical books on bookshelves? Those aren't decoration, they actually use them just like a Programmer uses Documentation. Now, they also use Google. [end]
[start] I mean, the number 3 cause of death in the US is medical error, so there's that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ [end]
[start] No googling doesn't make you a programmer.  You need stackoverflow for that. [end]
[start] OP is Lamo. [end]
[start] This sub is so fucking repetitive. Programmers vs doctors, I can't escape vim, and stackoverflow male up like 90% of these jokes. Stop reposting the same joke. [end]
[start] Well, if phycisians would share information publically the same way developers do, maybe googling could actually be a viable way to learn the trade as you go. Docs DO look up stuff all the time, but it's closed-source and proprietary. [end]

[start] Just completed my first python project after spending hours googling stuff, getting confused on stack overflow. Felt like a proud programmer. Opened reddit saw this meme now I'm confused. [end]

[start] One day my doctor literally made a research in front of me of my symptoms on his computer. [end]
[start] My wife is a Dr and I am an IT guy.., I can relate to this! 😂 [end]
[start] Shit I had a coding exercise for an interview last week. They were all cool with me googling and copying from stack overflow.  Got an offer the day after [end]
[start] Doctors have references also, it's just a slightly more specific type of reference. [end]
[start] The programming part of my degree is entirely accredited to Google [end]
[start] Stack overflow gang represent [end]
[start] Last week I had an interview with an unexpected SQL competency test. At this point I'd spent only one afternoon learning SQL ever, but by the grace of Google I managed to answer all of the questions in the test, and even got a job offer.   Thanks Google [end]
[start] Docs don’t use google. They use UpToDate. [end]
[start] I feel attacked [end]
[start] Not true. I did desktop support for a hospital. I had to fix a computer post surgery...what was on the screen? wikiHow on the surgery they were doing. [end]
[start] It does not unmake you from being a doctor. [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] And then the doctor give you a note at the end with the same findings you had googled online [end]
[start] This is why I store a cached copy of StackOverflow on my computer. [end]
[start] Just wanted to say thanks to this sub for helping me have things to talk about and ask my friend that works as a programmer. [end]

[start] Trust me, doctors google stuff all the time. [end]
[start] **Real** programmers thrash about on Duck Duck Go [end]
[start] You know... There is a medical profesional equivalent of Stack Exchange called Up to Date. All the docs I work with in the ER use it for pretty much every complex patient. [end]
[start] Wanna know a secret about what your doctor is doing when he steps out of the room? [end]
[start] I’m a doctor and I google shit all the time. Only we use UpToDate which is like a more expensive premium google for medical providers. [end]
[start] Laughing ass my off [end]
[start] More and more today; doctors that can quickly get the information they need via sources online are becoming the norm.  The field is progressing so quickly that no one can really keep up with everything; what's right one day might be wrong the next.  So the docs that realize this and can actually get that up to date accurate information are more and more what hospitals are demanding. [end]
[start] That's why I keep my current job. Those "show me the syntax for...." interviews would kick my ass. [end]
[start] being able to search a database or search engine efficiently is a skill in itself [end]
[start] "I don't quite know how to put this, but our entire field is bad at what we do, and if you trust us, everyone will die."  https://xkcd.com/2030/ [end]
[start] Woa dude [end]
[start] This is why I HATE technical interviews so much. When they just start firing trivia at you. I don't have most of that shit memorized. What I have memorized is syntax, format, logic structures, best practices. Everything else I google when I need it.  I really wish more companies would figure this out. Either do a general "Tell us what you've worked on" conversation to gauge my skill level, or if you must, give me a quick project to do and have me send you the code. Please stop making me take timed programming tests that don't represent what the actual job will be like. [end]
[start] To be fair I think the sentiment is just because you Google stuff online does not make you a Doctor. And I have the same sentiment about programers. You may be able to Google a working solution but that does not mean you understand how to make it work with your constraints. [end]
[start] Doctor then proceeds to Google stuff online [end]
[start] i will never not chuckle slightly at this meme [end]
[start] My friend had noticed his mental capacity starting to fail him, he diagnosed himself 8 months before the doctors could figure it out. He died 😢 a few months after they diagnosed him with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. [end]
[start] Thank god for stack overflow [end]
[start] I've actually outsmarted doctors in situations where they told me things that I knew were wrong. I tend to hold it in as to not be rude, but some things I just have to say.  I'm really interested in medications and psychology and the human body, and I've corrected so many doctors over the years some of them get REALLY pissed.   "You don't have a degree with 12 years of practice, I know more than you."   "Yeah? Then why did I watch you Google the drug I take 2 minutes ago? I could tell you all about it right off the top of my head." [end]
[start] Doctors Google stuff all the time.  It may not "make" you a doctor but it will keep you one. :-) [end]
[start] I think GPs could benefit from googling a bit more. I've encountered a few doctors that know less than I do about whatever specialist ailment I've spent days researching. [end]
[start] Cries in embedded [end]
[start] Stop making me question if it was worth going to college to be an indie dev instead of smth with a more useful degree [end]
[start] StackOverflow for the win [end]
[start] Interesting post. It really brings up the questions about the word "Doctor". For example who is more of a Doctor, a programmer with a doctorate degree, a Nurse with a Bachelors, a Dentist with a Doctorate, or a Doctor at a hospital (they can vary in degrees from Masters to PhDs)? Never knew this answer to this but Brooklyn 99 Had a really funny bit with Captain Holt about it [end]
[start] Yes [end]
[start] Idk, I went to the doctor a few days ago and he literally said "hold on let me Google that" [end]
[start] My doctor searched "diabetes" on Wikipedia in front of me. Is that normal? [end]
[start] How do you google something offline? Asking for a friend. [end]
[TITLE] Learn sorting algorithm with Kronk [TITLE]

[start] I love seeing to kind of thing. That's why I made a live wallpaper that will sort images of my phone. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tsaot.sortPaper  It does what op has in the gif. It randomly scrambles an image and then sorts it back together. I've added a few different rendering patterns, spirals, diagonals, etc... I'm wanting to add different scrambles (reversed, almost sorted, split into 4+ smaller versions, etc...) But haven't gotten the motivation to work on it. Maybe I'll work on it today. [end]

[start] Maybe the wrong sub for me to post this as I am not a programmer but this fascinated me and motivated me to look into these sorting algorithms to learn how they work, what the differences between them are, and which methodology is more suited for what kind of task.  Is there a good overall basic/layperson source anyone can suggest? [end]
[start] Well how about we show with actual sort times all with the same time scaling [end]
[start] By stretching the running time so these all finish at the same time you're failing to show the relative speed of these different algorithms, so I'm wondering what the point of this is beyond eye candy. [end]

[start] I heard this (probably apocryphal) story from a QA friend of mine who swears he was there.  It's a funny story, but take it with a grain of salt.      Anyway there was a big demo of this product that was supposed to track companys' fleets of trucks based on when and where they passed a network of transponders stationed on interstates all over the country.  In the company HQ, there was one of those "DEFCON 11" style operations rooms with a huge projection screen showing the location of every truck in the fleet.      One of the tweaks you could do is increase or decrease an "expected speed factor" that controlled the expected rate of travel for an individual truck, make/model of truck, geographical region, or even the whole country.  The idea being that sometimes you'll have generally slower conditions for any of those for whatever reason (e.g. huge snow storm on the East Coast)      The system would record each truck passing a transponder and then use the time since that event, the truck's history, and the tweak factor to provide an up-to-the-second expected location.  Which was displayed up on the big-ass screen.      Per usual, the CEO being given the demonstration walks up to the console as the "tweak" is being shown off and shoos the tech away.  And then he enters a huge negative number into the text box.      Instant chaos.  Trucks' positions are suddenly reversed, and they're all motoring at light speed- backward along the interstate (not literally, but on the display).  As soon as they "pass" a transponder location, they switch directions again and appear ahead of where they originally were, sometimes on an entirely different highway.  The big-ass projection screen becomes a mess of multicolored spaghetti lines and then pfft! goes dark when the system crashes.      CEO wanders off and says "you might want to add some data validation checks in that box."       End of demonstration.   [end]
[start] Except for the fire part, this is nearly identical to a tweet by Bill Sempf a few years ago. https://mobile.twitter.com/sempf/status/514473420277694465?lang=en  The fire part is funny though.  [end]
[start] Patch includes bathroom fix. Ordering beer crashes barman now [end]
[start] The bar should have the same response to ueicbksjdhd and bathroom [end]
[start] > uecbksjdhd  Now that's one use case I couldn't have anticipated. [end]
[start] That's why you first build a bar in the jungle and let the monkeys in. [end]
[start] That's a classic. A friend posted it on my wall some years back because I'm QA.  I was telling about this one developer who was slowly going insane because of me. We had been sitting together that day, I testing and documenting bugs, he coding and fixing bugs. He nudged me and said, "Okay, I got this working. I'll buy you lunch if you can break this." so I sat down and broke it in ten seconds to his utter amazement. Then I went back to what I was working on while he just stuttered out, "Wait, wait... what did you just do?"  The truth was he'd shown me his code earlier when I sat down by him, and I'd noticed a potential problem when I glanced at it... I hadn't wanted to tell him how to do his job at the time, and I thought maybe he'd notice once he looked back over his code, so I hadn't said anything, but I knew exactly what would break it. He never did buy me lunch.  ---  When I worked for Adobe testing LiveMotion, I discovered an issue where minimizing the application, then adjusting you screen resolution, caused all the palettes to disappear when you restored the application. Looking into what as causing it, I found a giant cluster of issues all revolving around minimizing the application. I filed about a dozen bugs. During our status meeting, the developer in charge of palettes ridiculed me for all the minimize bug, saying "Who's even going to do that?" and I had to tell him, "*I'm* going to do that. And if I'm going to do that, a customer is going to do that." They fixed the issue but he called me "Mister Minimize" for a couple weeks after that. [end]
[start] "The bar burned down."  "Call the help desk." [end]
[start] I don't need the toilet so the bar works fine for me.  It must be on your end. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I'm QA, and we don't do jokes. We do fantasy  &#x200B;  "There once was a developer who knew what he was doing...." [end]
[start] I can relate to this a lot. The problem is getting the requirement of whether a bar should have a bathroom or if it's not the type of bar you'd find a bathroom.  But then again, people don't put bathrooms in bars in the coding world just cause it makes sense.  [end]
[start] This is what you get for using unit tests instead of real QA. [end]
[start] Oh and I’ll take a بيرة please too ... [end]
[start] Toilet wasn't in the requirements!  [end]
[start] Forgot the stick test.   Gotta grab a long stick and poke every part of the bar and its employees. If the employee at the bar complains when poked in the eye, it's working correctly. [end]
[start] Then QA Engineer resets simulation, walks into bar and asks where the bathroom is. Nothing bad happens, flips desk. [end]
[start] I hate users. They have more entropy than natural disasters. [end]
[start] My Prof. grading my project... [end]
[start] QA guy here.  This guy skipped his regression testing. [end]
[start] Nah, the bathroom is TODO [end]
[start] So you QA’d the bar, but what about the foo? [end]
[start] I've never seen the second half. Awesome.  [end]
[start] Toilet wasn't in the requirements!  [end]
[start] it wasnt in the requirements! [end]
[start] Well we couldn't figure out what the problem was but now the bar has a working sprinkler system. You can use that as a workaround until we can find and fix the problem. [end]
[start] As a QA, that’s the story of my life.  [end]
[start] Every job these days has 'engineer' slapped onto the end of it. [end]
[start] And now the bar won't boot up. [end]
[start] I don’t think I belong in this subreddit  [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked [end]
[start] This is exactly why my departments QA testers worked on the help desk prior to being in QA. Gotta understand the dumb shit customers do to test it  [end]
[start] "But it worked at my local bar" [end]
[start] Real customers were not in the requirements.  [end]
[start] Serious question: Wouldn’t that be actually QC engineer rather than QA? At least in industry where I work in such test would be performed by quality control.  [end]

[start] this is why we all hate waterfall. should have iterated in a more agile way.  we need to iterate on this and we should start by selling beers out of a cooler at tailgates, then yadda yadda yadda we have a fully functioning bar. what's your estimate on how long that will take? [end]
[start] Looks familiar. [end]

[start] bar.exe has stopped working [end]

[start] The bathroom system wasn't implemented when the ordering system was tested. Regression tests included asking for the bathroom but only after ordering drinks. It didn't account for bathroom requests with a null order. [end]

[start] Bro, I've been wrapping my wife's ankle since she rolled it playing tennis.  I was an athletic trainer in high school/college, wrapping ankles is like riding a bike.

[start] At the other end of the spectrum. `ed`, [the standard text editor](https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.en.html)      golem$ ed          ?     help     ?     ?     ?     quit     ?     exit     ?     bye     ?     hello?     ?     eat flaming death     ?     ^C     ?     ^C     ?     ^D     ?

[start] It's all most like MS Clippy devs didn't lose their jobs, they found other teams.     Browser history isn't much better either..  I've had to edit the history with sqlite because it will suggest things that were typos or otherwise completely unrelated.   Worst part is the completion delay. [end]
[start] Everyone new to programming gets a heart attack. You can see them sweating with every word they type because the IDE Mark's 10 errors.  Then when you say "now add a ; to end the line" you can feel the relieve in them when they see the errors vanishing [end]
[start] "  IDE: **Everything is a string!!**  "  IDE: Oh.. ah.. well, ok then. [end]
[start] IDE's seriously need to chill with how often it checks you.  Like no wonder they're massive resource hogs, they're constantly checking every letter you type. [end]

[start] One of the reasons I don't use IDEs and don't recommend them. [end]
[start] Why cant you seeeeeeee  Your code belongs to meeeee [end]
[start] Text editor gang anyone? 😎 [end]
[start] Disable Resharper   I hate that thing so much.  It does a few things extremely well so I have to enable it now and then. [end]

[start] Police are the same, sadly the last sentence „Oh lol nvm“ doesn’t apply to them... (not all of them, of course. There are real bro policemen out there, but only few) :( [end]
[start] Microsoft Visual Studio Intellisense used to be so unstable that it would frequently crash when you typed a line that was not yet valid. People would try to work around this by typing the characters in a different order and writing the final semicolon first. [end]
[start] Seriously though, why is this a thing? I'm new at programming and this is driving me nuts! Why doesn't it check after you move on to the next line? I'm sure there's a reason, and I'd like to know. [end]
[start] what’s IDE? [end]
[start] Vim doesn't talk back to me like that [end]

[start] *compiles*  Application: ???????  *Adds an ending curly brace*  Application: ah, I see [end]
[start] I’ve never written a line of code in my life and don’t know what IDE is but I still laughed really hard at this [end]
[start] You type slower than it takes for your IDE to check things?  Pff, amateur. [end]
[start] Why do IDEs have to be so judgmental?! [end]
[start] Just use vim [end]
[start] Good job with the song reference in the title [end]
[start] Go is fun.  import (  "net/http"  )  *Save file*   Oh this import is unused, I'll just remove it for you.   I mean, I get it, but for neurotic savers like me, it can sometimes be annoying :-P [end]
[start] Just switched over to dBeaver and this is **so** true. I've never had an IDE be so aggressively... bad at guessing my intentions. [end]
[start] Oh can't you see, intellisense belongs to me [end]
[start] # UNUSED VARIABLE!  # THAT VARIABLE YOU HAVEN'T USED YET MAY BE CONST!!  # DON'T USE GOTO!!! [end]
[start] Complaints about ide's .... Kids now days  * Goes back to coding in ED * [end]
[start] When I was a kid (like maybe 10), I was stuck using the dumbest ever IDE. It wouldn't let you leave a line if that line caused an error. Now, as everyone knows, most of the time, the line that "causes" the error according to the compiler/interpreter isn't actually the line that needs to be fixed. And this IDE literally wouldn't let me leave the line and go fix the source of the problem. I had to save, exit and reopen every time that happened.  To this day, I still dislike IDEs. I much prefer to write my stuff in Notepad++. On the other hand, it did teach me to really think before I write. For some simple stuff, I can write a page or so of code without compiling and then have maybe one or two compile errors when I do run it through. [end]
[start] IDE: You want the whole code from this point on to be a string, dawg? Golly gee, you forgot to close whole hecken lot of stuff now, didn't you?  Also IDE: Trying to write in some quotation marks? How let's just make a pair to help you out... What's that deleting one? That's cool, I'll take both. [end]
[start] Feel this in my bones. [end]
[start] HA! I’ve been coding in C using vi for a few decades. Nothing makes a sound until the entire world is in flames, then after sifting through the rubble for a week, we found “free” run twice on the same pointer. [end]
[start] Me: renames file  IDE: NO STOP dear god I just saved you from accidentally ruining your entire program [end]
[start] This speaks to me on a spiritual level. [end]
[start] IDE: Declared variable never referenced.  Dev: I know. I just declared it. Wait a moment. I haven't even started the next line. [end]
[start] Imagine if the IDE waited 2 seconds before checking syntax      Not only better typing performance but none of this shit [end]
[start] too true to be real [end]
[start] I occasionally write faster or keep busy typing before the IDE mark it as error and if I did that it feels satisfying to be faster than the compiler. [end]
[start] This, but with MS Excel. [end]
[start] More like   > oh lol llvm [end]
[start] The best part is how your language servers eat your cpu while are still writing your code, and because of which your system slows down, and then you cannot write code that fast! [end]
[start] [TabNine](https://www.tabnine.com/)  You can thank me later. [end]
[start] `final String name;`  IDE: Are you going to use it or not?   ARE YOU EVEN GONNA USE IT?!  WHY IS IT FINAL IF THERE'S NO INITIAL VALUE STORED IN IT? DO YOU WANT ME TO STORE A VALUE IN IT? THAT'S NOT ON MY JOB DESC YOU MORON!  I'LL DELETE THAT FUCKING TRASH RIGHT NO-  Me: *writes a constructor that fills the variable*  IDE: Oh, never mind [end]
[start] I hate IntelliJ with a passion for its code highlighting. I get constant "identifier not found" highlights, then I hit compile, it works, still thinks the identifier can't be found. [end]
[start] Someone should make a passive-aggressive or even aggressive IDE. I would totally use it [end]
[start] When I do `/*` and it colours the rest of the code as comment😥 [end]
[start] /Laughs in Vim/ [end]
[start] Some IDEs are like paranoid girlfriends when you start typing on your phone:  "Who are you texting no seriously WHO ARE YOU TEXTING!!"  "oh you're looking up stuff on amazon... nevermind" [end]
[start] IDE: Auto-property accessor is never used.  Me: well it didn't exist until a second ago soooooo.... [end]
[start] My favorite is IntelliJ when you're writing a piece of functional code.  me:      moops.stream().map(moop  IntelliJ: "WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU, YOU FUCKING JACKASS"  Me:      moops.stream().map(moop ->  IntelliJ: "Jesus man, don't scare me like that." [end]
[start] i absolutely understand you dude, but what would be alternative? would you like to wait few seconds when you not sure? xD i think what would be awesome is that it would  "judge you" only in two scenarios. Either if you save a file, or if you press keybind. [end]

[start] VBA in Office... that is the most unforgiving interface.  It wants to correct you before you finish typing a word. [end]

[start] basically processing [end]
[start] My IDE deleted trailing white space on save. It drives me insane because I’m a compulsive saver. I hit save when thinking about the next line to write. So I lose the indentation and need to re-insert it myself.  I’ve taken to writing // before hitting save. [end]

[start] Now let's see her sort 17,000 objects [end]
[start] The last reaction exactly resembles my reaction when my program runs successfully. [end]
[start] Ah the infamous cute sort.  Heard of it but I've never seen it with my own eyes till today. [end]
[start] Sort of an algorithm. [end]
[start] How do I get my program to do that little dance at the end? I’m using python [end]
[start] My cousin would probably just try putting them on his head and drooling, this seems to be a higher level language specimen [end]
[start] I had to do a couple Towers of Hanoi puzzles for an ADHD evaluation a few weeks ago, and this video depicts exactly how I felt my evaluator was looking at me (except I'm a near 40 year old man). [end]
[start] Why aren't the cups in roygbiv order? [end]
[start] the most adorable sorting algorithm i've ever seen :)  also so happy once she was done :) [end]
[start] O(1) right here. [end]
[start] O(adorable) [end]
[start] Had these cups for my kids too. In all seriousness it really is amazing watching them master it and evolve their spatial reasoning to sort them. [end]
[start] Sort should always have a celebration outro. [end]
[start] Wholesome :)  lol I thought for a second she threw up two middle fingers at the end [end]
[start] This video is so much better with sound [end]
[start] It's called toddlersort and represents the result of almost everyone that tries to implement a sorting algorithm by themselves. [end]
[start] Imagine hugging your algorithm whenever it completes a task [end]
[start] The air punch celebration gets me every time [end]
[start] Toddler Sort? [end]
[start] How did she manage to implement bucket sort in O(n\^2)? [end]
[start] That algorithm is cute but no so efficient. [end]
[start] [Meanwhile my sort algorithm](https://i.imgur.com/zojx9jG.gifv) [end]
[start] The best part about a good sorting algorithm is the hugs after. [end]
[start] This is the cutest sort I have seen... [end]
[start] Its known as Baby Sort [end]
[start] She's so fucking cute. Heart melted a bit. [end]
[start] Ah, babysort. Classic [end]
[start] That's a bucket sort algorithm right there. [end]
[start] My sort algorithms also does a victory dance when done. [end]
[start] Wholesomely inefficient. [end]
[start] Dammit. Faster than my first sort algorithm. [end]
[start] That’s what I needed to see at the end of my 12h shift. You’re a good wo/man, thank you. [end]
[start] Is this how kids learn the difference between efficiency and effectiveness these days? [end]
[start] Insertion Sort? [end]
[start] she's definitely more performant than my home brewed sort functions [end]
[start] How do I make my algorithm dance after it finishes? [end]
[start] Still quicker than my usual code. [end]
[start] I do a dance everytime my shit works to [end]
[start] I didn’t look at the sub and was thinking, this is like a sorting algorithm [end]
[start] monkey can do it faster :) [end]
[start] Why did I just watch a child sort colored buckets for 45 seconds and then get so happy when she succeeded? Is this what's it like to be a parent? [end]
[start] cute, but inefficient... fire her [end]
[start] Bucket sort of course [end]
[start] And my mom still can't understand plugging in an HDMI cable. [end]
[start] `toddlerSort()` [end]
[start] Okay, that was freaking adorable, and I don't even like kids. [end]
[start] That little dance of victory is so cute [end]
[start] Little known fact: ksort accepts a second arg (bool) and if set to true does a dance on completion. [end]
[start] My partner just showed me this video! I am not a programmer, but I used to be an ASL interpreter. I'm pretty sure at the end the little girl gleefully signs something like "You tried to do the same thing but can't!"  And then "Yesss."  Aaaa my heart. This precious child!! <3 [end]
[start] O(n!^n! ) [end]
[start] This is legit the cutest thing I've ever seen [end]
[start] Maybe I'm just reading too much into it but it's fascinating how the learning process works on a toddler like this. [end]
[start] Task done.  Now it's time to terminate the program [end]
[start] Is this exponential sort? [end]
[start] I want my algorithms to dance like her [end]
[start] O(n^FUCK) [end]
[start] When you believe standard sorting algorithms are shit and you write your own one. [end]
[start] Future Google employee! [end]
[start] well that's the sweetest algorithm I've seen so far [end]

[start] Actual footage of me attempting a leetcode problem. [end]
[start] I felt happy for her when she finally got it. [end]
[start] Out of curiosity, what would this big O be? [end]
[start] I could have done it on the first try. [end]
[start] These cups are my favorite toy that my 1-yr-old has. This video is part of the appeal, but they also stack like a pyramid if the cups are mouth down, or like an inverted pyramid if the cups are mouth up. Plus there's this whole phase where a kid first discovers they can put small stuff inside them and that's fun to watch. There's like 20 different ways to play with them and yet the set is completely self contained. Understated genius and I love it. [end]

[start] Next she'll code in Python. [end]
[start] The really interesting thing about this sort is that you can tell with a quick "look" operation the rough size of a bucket, but if you have two buckets of similar size, you can only tell with a more expensive "combine" operation which one is actually bigger. That definitely makes it more challenging! [end]

[start] So this is like a cave man story compared to what you guys do but years ago I worked for a company that sold liquidated products on eBay. We had literally no official process to keep track off everything, from the products we had tested/inspected to the stuff we had for sale or had already been sold. Literally half the day was figuring out where stuff was and what condition it was in. So I decided I'd try to make a database and knowing nothing about what to do, I did it using Microsoft Access. To be fair to myself, if it was just me using this database from my computer it probably would have worked. But we're talking multiple work stations needing the info to be updated in real time so I'm sure everyone here can realize Access is not what you want to use. So after creating the database and it failing after a few hours of working, I came to my boss and told him we needed to take a step back and do this the right way, possibly taking a few days (putting it lightly) to get everything into a proper system. And yet he just looked at me like I was crazy, that what I had done already had taken too much time and that we were fine. So after telling him his incompetence would be the downfall of us, I just let things fall apart and boy did things. A few weeks later I had left the company. [end]
[start] 8 people needed to do job at 100% have 6 people manager: why wasn't everything done? why can't you do more with less? [end]
[start] As a counter argument, if “the job” was to draw a picture so that someone knew which superhero it was then 12 seconds was plenty of time.  [end]
[start] So why don't you just cut the one from the 10min, glue it into the 10sec frame and I pay you for 1 min? [end]
[start] 10 ~~Minutes~~ Hours | 1 ~~minute~~ hour | 10 ~~seconds~~ minutes  Now you have all the time you need. [end]
[start] The question that most teams struggle with is which one of those is good enough for your customer?  In a lot of cases, the customer's actually fine with that middle one but it's amazing how many dev teams still try to produce the first one and then wonder why they are getting shouted at. [end]
[start] Then put three people on it!  — and make a baby in one month with nine women.... [end]
[start] Uh, this feels so personal. Last week my boss asked me for a report that usually takes me 3-4 days to finish, but she needed it done in a day. Nevertheless I made some mistakes so they gave me a feedback. I was screaming inside, but hey, such is life. [end]
[start] 12.84 = 12? That's some floor() shit right there. [end]
[start] This right here is why I decided to not get into any commercial art or art related job.  Deadlines would’ve killed my passion for drawing/ art!  [end]
[start] Add nine more artists and you can do the 10 min one in 1 min.  [end]
[start] To be fair:  - the 10 seconds variante may suffice, client can see where to go from there  - a lot of people would still give you the 10 seconds variante after 10 minutes   [end]
[start]  Hey /u/resueman__,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts. [end]
[start] So if we get 10 of you doing the 1 minute challenge, it should produce a 10 min result, right? [end]
[start] Since my clients are often startup founders without technical skill, I explain the concept of "how long does it take to make software" with a counter-question "how long does it take to prepare a pitch for investors?"    You can actually make a pitch deck for your company in an hour.    But let's say you have a meeting with an investor next week.  You could land ten million bucks and be funded for two years if you get it right.    Should you spend an hour on that pitch, or a week?    So the real question in building software isn't so much "how long will this take?" but rather "how much time do we have?"    Lots of people see programming as being like an HVAC installation.  Given a system you want to build, there are steps that need to be followed and it will take some X time and after that time the system is complete and functional.    But programming is more like writing a pitch, or an essay.  You can have it done rather quickly, but that "done" is low quality.  Most of the time you spend isn't getting to "done" but getting to the best version of done you can get to.    Like in art, programming has enough variation that you can increase the quality continuously.  [end]

[start] But when we said six weeks, we really meant four weeks hoping to at least squeeze three out of them. They know this, so they won't let us have six weeks, but they also know they won't really get it in two, which is why they lied and they're not really sure if the next team will be ready to take delivery anyway.  Agile improved on this situation by having us all just admit that we're lying. We still lie, though. Even about how we're not doing waterfall anymore. Cuz we still are. [end]
[start] Hahahaha but they quality has to stay the same ;) [end]

[start] This is a pretty typical job posting at an early-stage startup, where specialists aren’t very useful but generalists thrive. In my experience startups expecting this kind of resume pay top-of-market, because one guy who knows a little bit of everything and is able to drive a whole lot of business value while getting things up and running is a lot more valuable to the company than a whole bunch of people who are really good at one thing.  That said, you don’t need every single one of those things - it’s not a requirement list, it’s a wish-list, or a list of relevant and related things. My company does mostly Elixir and React, but our job postings list Python, Ruby, Angular, etc. as options because someone with experience in those languages should have no trouble picking up the stack we use.

[start] In all honesty what they’re saying is “do you enough understanding to integrate with this tech stack”. You do not have to be an expert, just know the key points and be able to have a discussion with someone about them.  Translated : - Can you program in these languages (essential, it’s a dev job) - Do you know a front end web framework and know the key differences between the two most popular, can you pick a new one up quickly?  - do you understand SQL, NoSQL and know what Redis is? You should have an  understanding of these and good experience in either SQL/NoSQL as a software dev. - Do you understand what these key AWS services are? Picking them up is trivial if you know regular systems. - Can you use a Linux terminal and familiar with the day to day commands and configs? This is essential for anyone working in IT. - Do you write tests, understand what CI means, and know how the no1 code repository tool works? This is all basic ABC developer knowledge. - Can you build and write Docker containers? Slightly newer, but you will pick this up in under 24 hours with a little effort, again pretty trivial.  In all honesty this seems like a realistic expectation of a mid-level Software Engineer with roughly 3 years experience. [end]

[start] In case anyone missed it [Missle UI] (https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Mis-Click-640x480.jpg) [end]
[start] I didn't realise my grandmother worked for our missile alert systems. [end]
[start] In all seriousness something few seem to be talking about is how the poor UI design could equally lead to a real warning not being sent out and instead the test option being chosen. [end]
[start] What happened? [end]
[start] You could have at least jpegged the last 3 lines.  ^^Why ^^do ^^I ^^notice ^^these ^^things? ^^*sigh* [end]
[start] I wouldn't be angry at Java pushing unwanted installations if they didn't automatically have every box checked. No, I do not want Yahoo as my default search engine, thanks. [end]

[start] Dammit! I'm installing Java right now on a new laptop. Seeing that checked and being unable to uncheck it gave me a heart condition. [end]

[start] Please someone explain the joke here? [end]
[start] Missed opportunity for "Keep unchecked if you want x to happen" [end]

[start] doing the same mistake ..even  I had a idea on it  [end]
[start] Took me way too long to work this out 😂😂 [end]
[start] That's why you use ninite for installing software [end]
[start] Windows  Would you like to send the missile alert now?  No.  Okay the middle alert has been postponed for 12.00 A.M. tomorrow. [end]
[start] Ohhh I clearly didn't look close enough, didn't notice middle alert 😆 thankyou  [end]
[start] That can't be how it happened, no there was a seal joke that's what I remember. [end]
[start] So are missile alerts okay in general but not Java-based missile alerts?  A Java-based missile would be a terrible weapons system. The missile wouldn't load, and if it did it would hang in mid-flight. [end]
[start] i dont care that you program for a living or have very strong opinions regarding the minutae of your computer janitor job [end]
[start] What a blast from the past! I haven't seen the actual installer for things like Java, Flash in ages... I just use [Ninite](https://ninite.com/).  [end]

[start] Should've gone with a tide pod ad. [end]
[start] Accurate. Highly accurate... [end]
[start] See you on the front page. [end]
[start] This is click jacking. This is a legitimate attack vector... [end]
[start]  I love all these jokes because word on the street is the dude selected the wrong item in a drop down menu and all it said was "are you sure you want to select this item?"  [end]
[start] Here we go again...  [end]
[start] I wish it was an ad for Tide Pods [end]
[start] This was reposted by someone else on r/funny without any link here and it is at #3 on r/all.  I would go reaffirm your creation of this (if it is yours) if I were you. [end]
[start] Makes sense [end]
[start] 😱 [end]
[start] Fucking Reddit does this with promoted posts. [end]
[start] Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post! &nbsp;  *****  *^I ^am ^a ^bot, ^probably ^quite ^annoying, ^I ^mean ^no ^harm ^though*  *^Message ^me ^to ^add ^your ^account ^or ^subreddit ^to ^my ^blacklist* [end]
[start] That's actually not a bad deal [end]
[start] Best part about this is the mouse movement.  *click* “...Nooooooooo!!! God dammit.” ... “What’s this? Sports watches? Ummm, I’m good.” [end]
[start] Hawaii warning system UI is the new phone number input, INVEST INVEST INVEST! [end]
[start] My computer tends to react like it received a nuclear missile warning on the rare occasion these ads get me.  Fan starts just runnin’ away, sending me a bunch of garbled end of the world messages, everything goes into slow motion, then right as it’s about to go full blue screen I do what this guy obviously should have done and alt-f4 that bitch immediately. [end]
[start] Great performance by the cursor.  [end]
[start] Ad least he didn't click the Advertisement. [end]

[start] Is it time for another round of shitty UIs? I'm ready. [end]
[start] Most posts on this sub are usually related to things that only programmers understand, but now there's more and more posts that most people can understand. [end]
[start] You are the true OP. Not just a reposter. Live long and prosper until the heat death of the universe! [end]
[start] Funny thing about this: (Every single programmer reading this knows I'm right)  Someone pointed out the fact the early warning system was faulty, probably months or years ago. They were shouted down by some rectangle-head in a meeting (**"NOT BEING MUCH OF A TEAM PLAYER THERE, TIM.  YOU KNOW THE HOLIDAYS ARE COMING UP AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A GOOD FIST FUCK"**) and then ordered to build it wrong under threat of being fired.    After they built it wrong they were fired anyway.     [end]
[start] and the ad is probably sth they searched for like, last week  fucking algorithms [end]
[start] "Screenshot" [end]
[start] i have been legitimately triggered. shit like this has gotten me written up at work. [end]
[start] Like the ad pop out after click. So realistic too  [end]
[start] You know what was more disappointing than the actual fuck up, was people's complete lack of preparation and fatalistic panic. I feel like people have prepared more for a zombie apocalypse.  A north korean ICBM detonation might be unlikely, but it's still possible - and it's entirely survivable with just some basic planning.  An NK ICBM is ~200kt yield, which puts the lethal range around 1.5 miles from the detonation point. Oahu is 20 miles across - that gives you roughly a 0.05% chance of being in that blast zone (assuming it even hits the island directly, let alone Honolulu itself. If it's a surface strike, the fallout will be what kills more people, though it's highly dependent upon wind direction/speed. Still, most of the fallout will fall in the ocean (and fallout sinks so being on a boat is pretty safe if you can wash the decks), but if you are in that wind direction, sheltering in a concrete building for two weeks should allow enough time for the radiation to decay 99% and be safe enough to go outside and find evacuation. Permanent evacuation off the island is not even necessary - just get to the clean side.  tl;dr; Buy 20 power bars and 10 1L bottles of water and know where to go.  From what happened this last weekend, you'll probably be alone in the shelter surrounded by streets full of panicked corpses when you emerge.   [end]

[start] On Desktop with an adblocker it's rarely a problem these days, if the region has proper internet speeds that is. On mobile I basically have the choice to use the actual mobile site which will often not allow any interaction until the page is fully loaded, or to stick with the desktop site to avoid the loading time but get annoyed by these realignments.  For Reddit in particular, neither the mobile page nor app has given me what I wanted from it, so I still use the desktop page on mobile. [end]

[start] What is up with the apple blue selection on chrome? All divs and buttons get this blue selection almost everywhere when clicked, I don't think this is intended.  Edit: an example here on reddit: https://i.imgur.com/weH1YMu.png [end]
[start] shouldn't have used windows 10 amirite? [end]
[start] Phew!  Almost clicked that ad.  Dodged a bullet on that one. [end]
[start] *clicks*  *google ad shows up* *thinks to self* this is real legit [end]
[start] the little shake of the mouse cursor... Damn that was funny. [end]
[start] REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE [end]
[start] This game me such a good chuckle at work. Thanks OP [end]
[start] Thank god for ublock...  [end]
[start] Fuck pop-up ads [end]
[start] Advertisements are getting smarter.  [end]
[start] i dont blame them  [end]
[start] Or Facebook loading a ton of names and making you miss the name you wanted to select. [end]
[start] deep breaths.. [end]
[start] only £3.99, noice [end]
[start] I have this same problem with the software used for trouble tickets. I don't know how many times I've canceled a call on accident. I never mean to cancel closing a call. Ever. But they put that button right where my thumb hits it. [end]
[start] Some EA executive somewhere just got his panties all wet thinking that they could offer an ad free version through micro transactions. [end]
[start] This actually made me laugh out loud in public  [end]
[start] Ah okay. That makes a lot more sense. I heard that the 38 minute delay was caused by an ambigious set of "select all squares with street signs" CAPTCHAs. [end]
[start] Why don't you put a "are you sure?" Dialogue box??  I had a major fuck up while i was working in a multinational because of too hasty click and no confirmation dialogue box. There wasn't a before and after that incident with my manager. We got along very good before that and hadn't talk much until i quit [end]
[start] Fucking spot on!  [end]
[start] Ad blockers forever!!!!!!! [end]
[start] God I hate when things like that pop up at the exact moment I decided to click on something. [end]
[start] Most likely how i came ti be... [end]
[start] this is not a screenshot.  it is a screencapture.  amateurs. [end]
[start] I feel like you could have waited a day to let the other guy's funny shitty ui post have its time to shine. both good though i guess [end]
[start] Lol! [end]
[start] Ooh! And I bet the guy was using a Galaxy S8! [end]
[start] Would it be possible for a browser to lock movement to the location of the mouse cursor when other parts of the page load up?  So anything loading above the mouse cursor would move up rather than pushing everything down.  If you could do that, that would be fab. [end]
[start] I love when you go to click delete next to a message in Outlook and a new message comes in just as you click and you delete the message above the one you wanted. [end]
[start] Should have used adblock... [end]
[start] Hahahaha Lol. [end]
[start] Whatever happened to the days of image placeholders on web pages still being rendered?  Pepperidge Farm remembers. [end]
[start] Every time I try to widen the window on PornHub, the Chromecast icon pops up in the widen window icons place (moving the other icons over) and I always almost stream porn to our TV.  Same concept. [end]
[start] This is brilliant [end]
[start] This is just like the Google app- you go to tap the search bar and then tap one of the completely useless categories as they pop up. [end]
[start] Seems like r/assholedesign is leaking [end]
[start] Lmao this is the best one [end]
[start] Invasion of the ads [end]
[start] This gave me a PTSD flashbacks of the days I wasnt aware of adblock.  [end]
[start] I actually laughed out loud at this in my quiet office haha [end]
[start] I believe it.  [end]
[start] DEADASS. That's why I have uBlock. If ads didn't suck I'd "support your content" but the fact is, ads are garbage and I'm not looking at them. [end]
[start] This was fantastic.  [end]
[start] This is hilarious [end]
[start] This is perfect. [end]
[start] Dude!!! Just saw the actual "interface" - no buttons, no colors, no prompts, only listed text with links. [end]
[start] YuP [end]
[start] Well at least the day you'll want to send an actual alert, you will get a pretty good deal of the day on whatever product you don't need. [end]
[start] No one's going to point out that if this was a real missile threat, the guy would be clicking the ad instead, causing the alert to be postponed from him having to back to the website and then wait for the ad to load fully before clicking again? 😂 [end]
[start] Joking aside. I wish there was a way to prevent links from being clickable a certain brief duration if they're moved without the user input.  I have this issue CONSTANTLY. Multiple times every day. It's so annoying.  I feel like I am being trolled because sometimes it feels like they wait til think I am safe to click. And bam! it moves.   [end]
[start] Basically this happened to me the other day with a Windows Update.  I'd just gotten done making some major software changes and was just about to commit them when Windows popped up a "HEY BUDDY LET'S GO DO SOME WINDOWS UPDATE" with the "OK" button literally right under where my mouse clicked a 10th of a second later. [end]
[start] The worst part is that even YouTube is doing it (The last time I saw YouTube with ads that is) [end]
[start] this is the best one by far [end]
[start] God damnit, you made me snort [end]
[start] u/imtooka [end]
[start] Honestly, wouldn’t be surprised if companies did ads there [end]
[start] Needs more <blink> [end]
[start] The reason I don't use Textra (free version). [end]
[start] I'm glad you guys are having fun with this, but you can't even get *close* to how bad the real thing is:  https://twitter.com/CivilBeat/status/953127542050795520 [end]
[start] Brilliant, I believe in this version of the story. [end]
[start] They use British Pounds in Hawaii? I never knew. That explains why everything is needlessly more expensive! [end]
[start] So, if they installed ublock origin, wouldn't it also prevent nuclear launch pop ups?  [end]
[start] But the ad isn't in freedom units... [end]
[start] That little mouse wiggle of panic is perfect. [end]
[start] haha [end]
[start] Now all it needs is the cancel button which crashes the program and the windows error reporter  [end]
[start] Those adds popping up and messing up my click was always something I thought that just happened to me.  [end]
[start] Just like search suggestions [end]
[start] And then he checked the ad and also probably ordered it since it took him 30 fucking minutes to send everyone a warning about this mistake [end]
[start] This is quality stuff for r/PerfectTiming [end]
[start] u/Nexty6 [end]
[start] Freaking Amazon. [end]
[start] My ptsd is flaring up  [end]
[start] The increasing amount of websites purposely doing stuff like this is ridiculous.  [end]
[start] The best part is this really isn't even that far off. [end]
[start] Eees a fahked ahhp...  because ees maybe a true.    Ha ha ha ha.  [end]
[start] This is getting too real. [end]
[start] I was about to throw my phone across the room in frustration when I realized that I was on my laptop. [end]
[start] I've never understood this "jumpy" behavior in the UI, can someone explain this? Is it just the DOM loading slowly when trying to add too many resources? [end]
[start] Same happened in Japan xd [end]
[start] Pandora is notorious for that [end]
[start] this happens to me whenever it asks to set my crossdressing photos to public or private. i always accidentally click private and its so damn annoying. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Here we go again...   [end]
[start] Take notes, Pandora Radio. [end]
[start] REAL FINAL MASTER VER4 2017-11-5 2.html [end]
[start] Brilliant [end]
[start] And when it's an actual warning he downloads the newst flash player. [end]
[start] As much as this is supposed to be a joke it represents a significant problem.  This is way too common even among organizations that are supposedly good at interface design.  Designers really ought to start being more mindful about elements that can move after the user has already begun interacting with the page.   [end]
[start] I thought this was /r/assholedesign [end]
[start] This is so fucking realistic. Especially on mobile where it will load the page and its elements and when you click on something the button to download the app pops up right where you clicked [end]
[start] Actual warning should be under password and password link with test button...? [end]
[start] I don't throw the word "genius" around lightly, but... [end]

[start] *Image Transcription: Twitter Post*  ---  **Jake Williams**, @MalwareJake  Dear web developers,  The answer is zero. Zero. Get it through your thick skulls. Zero is the number times anyone has EVER wanted something to autoplay on your site and start making noise. I'd honestly rather you mine crypto-currency in my browser than use my speakers.  \#kthxbye  [*This post has 560 replies, 10,894 retweets and 41,195 likes.*]  ---  ^^I'm&#32;a&#32;human&#32;volunteer&#32;content&#32;transcriber&#32;for&#32;Reddit&#32;and&#32;you&#32;could&#32;be&#32;too!&#32;[If&#32;&#32;you'd&#32;like&#32;more&#32;information&#32;on&#32;what&#32;we&#32;do&#32;and&#32;why&#32;we&#32;do&#32;it,&#32;click&#32;here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index) [end]
[start] My favorite is when some annoying noise randomly starts and I can't find where its coming from.  Love that [end]
[start] Only blame devs when shit breaks and doesn’t get fixed for long periods of time.   Otherwise: PMs and clients. We try to push back on bad ideas the best we can but ultimately we have no say. [end]
[start] Also requests for notifications. No I don't want your website to be able to send notifications. My phone is already blowing up with random spam, I don't need my PC doing it too. [end]
[start] I'd be complaining too, but I've resorted to a more effective appoach: blocking and subverting their ad revenue with adblockers and abusing loading frames to skip entire ad rolls on mobile (the back, home, and screen lock buttons can be powerful when they code their ad roll tracking metrics poorly). If they want to force-play intrusive ads that are over 40 times louder than what I was doing (especially in written media where having my audio below 10% is now waking the dead) - forcing ads to not even appear is only fair as a countermeasure.  Now dont get me wrong. Ad revenue is fine when its respectful. But when a site/service goes full ad-whore with zero quality control or user consideration, I lose all sympathy. [end]
[start] Okay fine no auto play, but I am doubling down on all horizontal scrolling! [end]
[start] I find that when videos (that I actually want to watch) start playing muted it's almost equally as annoying.   I have to unmute the video and seek backwards to hear what I missed, but then the fucking seeking backwards takes longer to load than the initial load of the video. What the hell!?  Just keep the videos paused ffs [end]
[start] We tracked the metrics and this feature has increased ads play duration by 42069%. That's a lot of revenue, so this feature is here to stay [end]
[start] I'm sure they have the indicators to show it "drives engagement", but when Cnet relentlessly tries to shove their autoplaying player into my eyeballs I just think their content is so shitty they have to do that for anyone to watch it. I'm even less inclined to give it a shot.  Autoplaying videos AND a scroll-following popup, like how desperate can you get for those views? [end]
[start] I've refused to implement a feature like that several times. Someone else had to do it. The tests we ran proved that autoplay makes a lot of money.  Use browser extensions. [end]
[start] Let me tell you that should be starting "dear _Marketing Managers_" not developers 🙄. Other useless outdated bullshit we're also sick of being forced to implement includes...  - sliders - anything parallax - animating literally every element in on scroll - animated snow flakes at Christmas. [end]
[start] /u/repostsleuthbot [end]
[start] The answer is ONE. One person and only one person wants it, and it is always the client. [end]
[start] *Laughs in pornhub chromecast button* [end]
[start] And zero is the amount of times a developer have decided that. [end]
[start] Also I never want push notifications for your site. if it were so important, you could create a rss feed [end]
[start] It's mildly infuriating that he thinks video autoplay is what the developers want. [end]
[start] This should be directed at product managers [end]
[start] Fucking Netflix... [end]
[start] Web devs: Pain [end]
[start] Yeah well when the Ops Manager comes up and says "You know what would be cool?", there's only so many times you can talk him down from thinking this shit is a good idea [end]
[start] Media Company Owners: Get you a dev that can do both... [end]
[start] But how will people on my myspace page know I’m cool though? [end]
[start] also dear porn site developers,   Don't mind if you auto-play the videos.  Although will appreciate it if you start all videos with audio OFF by default. [end]
[start] YouTube after clicking to watch a video. [end]
[start] If steam would stop autoplaying shitty game videos everytime I check out a game, that's be great. [end]
[start] Website would like to show you notifications? [end]
[start] http://www.demonbuster.com/boyce.html  Great example of this [end]
[start] Yeah, I can tell you that ever web developer I've met would never put that in, unless the client specifically asks for it and cannot be detered [end]
[start] oh my god this one client who was running a haunted hayride at a big halloween attraction HAD to have autoplaying *tractor nosies* on page load  like loud farm equipment engine noises  i can't think of a worse, more jarring unexpected noise. i cant take enough showers to cleanse me of this sin. i am sorry. [end]
[start] Unless the website is Youtube [end]
[start] It's not web developers making these decisions, it's marketing / PR departments that think they just found the holy fucking grail of engaging with visitors to their website. [end]
[start] “cLiCk AlLLoW nOtIfiCaTiOnS tO pRoVe YoU aRe NoT a RoBoT” fuck you [end]
[start] How about when you open a site, something starts autoplaying but since the ui is so clattered you can't even find the video window. So you quickly close the site before you go insane. [end]
[start] Or those fucking godforsaken shitass videos that minimize to the bottom of your screen when you scroll past them [end]
[start] This is not a developper decision this is clearly a client request please do not hate the builder he must build what he is paid to build. [end]
[start] Web developers? You think they’re the ones making this choice? Try the marketing department [end]
[start] Dear web developers, The answer is zero. Zero. Get it through your this skulls. Zero is the number of times anyone has EVER wanted to see ads on your site. I'd honestly rather you charge a monthly fee than use my speakers. #kthxbye  It's not the web devs that get to make these kind of decisions, it's the clients (stuff corporate). Whether you want the ad to play sound or not is irrelevant, you're supposed to be smashed in the face with ads and articles till you're numb, that's by design. [end]
[start] Why are you telling web developers? You're gunna wanna talk to the business folks about that. We tell, them tell us to stfu and do it anyway. [end]
[start] Speak for yourself, I expect [http://loli.dance/](http://loli.dance/) to autoplay when I load the website. [end]
[start] There are legitimate uses for autoplay, but most sites get it wrong. It’s all about what the user is expecting. News sites that start playing some random unrelated video that have nothing to do with the article are the worst. [end]
[start] While this is almost always correct, the pedant in me must point out that most users want Youtube and similar sites to autoplay with sound. [end]
[start] This is litteraly a repost from 2 years ago, four places above the original one in top posts of all time here. [end]
[start] I miss MySpace [end]
[start] You realize we need to inflate the numbers of views on videos and ads somehow right [end]
[start] I would rather have neither of those [end]
[start] Repost [end]
[start] This has been posted way too many times already. [end]
[start] Laugh in Safari autoplay blocker [end]
[start] There has been one time. The site was a loading screen for a game server And we had to autoplay our server's theme (which only lasted like 12 seconds) but the chromium engine blocked our autoplay audio. And cursor interaction with the loading screen is not allowed by the game engine. [end]
[start] You forget about zombo.com where the infinite is possible. [end]
[start] YouTube without autoplay will be shitshow [end]
[start] So true! A site das auto plays anything, will immediately be closed and never visited again. [end]
[start] "Why not both and give you 1TB of cookies?" [end]
[start] 0 is the number if you‘re lucky executing your code [end]
[start] Everyday I'm against my wills of implementing these Zero features. [end]
[start] Relevant XKCD: https://xkcd.com/1280/ [end]
[start] Amen for that [end]
[start] That can be arranged, Jake. [end]
[start] Ugh, the worst is when you’re listening to music and it cuts off to start *loading* an ad. Makes me want to write a strongly worded letter to whom it may concern. [end]
[start] So true [end]
[start] I have a browser that blocks autoplay in background tabs, and even mutes a background tab if the foreground tab starts playing stuff. [end]
[start] Don't pin that on us. I am a backend Dev so i don't really have to put those things but I have heard my front end colleagues crying multiple times to those requests from the manager or the clients... [end]
[start] I would think less sites are doing this since ADA is becoming a huge legal issue lately. [end]
[start] ***It's never been up to the developers*** [end]
[start] Clearly this guy never heard my baller MySpace song choices... [end]
[start] That's why I set about:config:media.autoplay.enabled=false to stop those kind of shenanigans ... and then a bunch of websites break :-(  I mean, come on.  Who writes this crap? [end]
[start] When I click a Youtube video I want it to auto play. [end]
[start] Advertisement is not about what you want to do, son.  It's about what they want you to do. [end]
[start] Isnt that the whole premise to Myspace? [end]
[start] Im kinda sick of r/all autoplaying videos tbh. [end]
[start] That ain't us that's the business side. [end]
[start] Blame our clients, we just do as they say, even if we say "people don't really like this"   They don't give a shit [end]
[start] I want notifications from every site I visit [end]
[start] Hey reddit, u listening? [end]
[start] Next YouTube update? [end]
[start] PM - we got to hit the deadline.  Dev- where is the low level requirement.  PM- still working on it.  Dev - so, build what. PM- let me talk about requirements  Dev - but you still talking high level stuff.  🙄 [end]
[start] What if the video that plays is Never gonna give you up? [end]
[start] Please don’t blame web devs for something they probably tried to stop themselfs. [end]
[start] I actually like videos that autoplay on reddit, especially because they auto play on mute. [end]

[start] How about YouTube? [end]
[start] Nothing gets me to leave a website faster than a pop-up video that autoplays. [end]
[start] Netflix App... [end]
[start] Did a university not do a study with a PiHole on their infrastructure and bandwidth was lowered by 30%. Solely in adverts not playing? [end]
[start] Always have the volume on low or mute. You never know what can start playing [end]
[start] Blame PM & Marketing [end]
[start] Pretty much what that is I thought they just farmed ads bitcoins [end]
[start] Sounds like someone used the wrong porn website while wife was in the house 😅 [end]
[start] Look I told them, but the dude with the money I really want to have insists upon it [end]
[start] Also videos that stop playing when you scroll down or switch to another tab. Reddit started doing that for me and it's so dumb. Sometimes audio is enough to know what's going on, I'd rather read the comments while the video is playing in the background. [end]
[start] Absolutely hate on reddit that I can watch a video on the homepage with the volume auto muted, but when I click to view the comments it auto plays twice with full volume. [end]
[start] Everytime in the Twitch front page it just autoplays some random stream and I keep trying to figure out where the sound is coming from lmao [end]
[start] I'd extend to that all commercials but somehow they're everywhere. Go figure. [end]
[start] *Stares in Netflix general direction.* [end]
[start] Reddit on desktop at least always spooking me. Kinda scary to scroll reddit on pc when high as fuck [end]
[start] Web developers are not the reason for this. [end]
[start] Just turn off autoplay in your browser. [end]
[start] ... Dammit, now I'll be distracted if I actually want to go and code a "tab muting whitelist".  Normally, you can mute obnoxious tabs, thus blacklisting offenders. Whitelisting tabs allowed to play audio would solve at least *some* of this issue.... [end]
[start] Wait?! This didn’t die out in 1999?  If a client ever asks for it, it is your duty as a web developer to come up with a lie on why they shouldn’t have it. To win them easier and make them believe you just throw out those techs words that no one knows really except other web devs!!! (You can even make up words just need to sound convincing)!! [end]
[start] I've tried every setting against auto play that i found on the net and they made no difference at all. [end]
[start] Also, if I search for a video of something, and you start autoplaying a news broadcast *about* the video, you should lose your mouse hand. [end]
[start] I always use ad blocking / privacy plugins. Have done so for years. Recently I built a new computer, started clean. Forgot to reactivate the plugins. Surfing without adblock was truly unbearable. Popups, overlaying content, autoplaying 'live'-streams (gotta bump up the views for the advertisers I guess)...  Sites really bring it onto themselves. I understand they need to make money, but this way you only keep ad blocking visitors... [end]
[start] What browsers allow auto play videos with audio these days? [end]
[start] Auto play with sound requires user interaction these days doesn’t it? Although I guess they could just bind to a scroll or click event on document... [end]
[start] The web developers brought that up in a meeting, but only once. [end]
[start] UBLOCK EVERYTHING. [end]
[start] What about whenever I go to zombocom? [end]
[start] Please turn off your ad blockers to support the costs of running our sites.   Also here’s a 15:00 video you didn’t ask to see automatically streaming. [end]
[start] Which programer doesn’t have ublock installed on their browser? [end]
[start] I’m looking at you, Robinhood!!! Every time the market goes wild, their app goes to shit, and I can’t cancel orders to create new ones.  However, when I go to search a stock, sure enough there will be three channels of cable news going right under the search box. It’s the most annoying thing and an absolute waste of bandwidth. If I cared what CNBC thought, I’d put it on the TV. [end]
[start] i pick default browser based on its ability to block auto-play. currently firefox is best because of availability of ad blockers, safari is the worst. any website that auto- plays gets blacklisted. [end]
[start] Loading your nerf with sabot rounds hahaha [end]
[start] This guy watched "The Big Short" [end]
[start] But Myspace was so successful! [end]
[start] Let's forget the "noise" bit for a second. I have media.autoplay.enabled set to false. Video still autoplays, including here on Reddit. Back in the Flash days it was dead easy to stop this shit. Now things seem ...harder. Is there actually a way to fix this??? [end]
[start] Unwanted noise from a product usually makes me doubt the product and the company.  Shyster tactics and super hard sells are an instant turn off. [end]
[start] Reddit app:   Let me just load all the videos and play them as you scroll [end]
[start] They ask me if it can be done and how much it costs. They rarely ask if it should be done at all.  "Oh no, I won't take your money to implement your bad idea that will take me almost no effort" we all would say, and that's most of the work gone. There just aren't enough good ideas for everyone to work on them.  Even if I reject working on bad ideas (luxury), you know someone's going to do it.  * Can it be done? Yes * By just about anyone? Yes * Expensive? No * Do you like money? Yes [end]
[start] ...and all of God's people said... AMEN! [end]
[start] This is amatuer shit.    Where's the subscription modal? [end]
[start] I refute this claim!  Youtube [end]
[start] After the client tells the developer to make it auto play; they comment it out until they have to push [end]
[start] Can you mine crypto in a browser? [end]
[start] ..and you probably didn’t :( [end]
[start] Let’s not give them any ideas please... 😂 [end]
[start] I have this problem with reddit, while scrolling all videos autoplay and some dont stop even if I continue scrolling. Also spanish newspapers I usually check have many autoplay videos in main page or in news. [end]
[start] Thats the worse of reddit, the autoplay "funny" videos with high volumen that sometimes get stuck and cant mute [end]
[start] Thought this was on the Ad Ops sub for a second. [end]

[start] I think it would be fair if people CONSENTED to crypto mining...  Hell. I wish I could create a Minecraft mod for that and ask people fully transparently to choose to run that if they want to support my server but don't have the ability to donate money via PayPal or Patreon. [end]
[TITLE] It's always fun.. [TITLE]
[start] I wrote a library. It was only used at my company, though, but I probably should have tried to share it. In 5 years, I had only a handful of questions because I documented the crap out of it and made it extremely useful. I only did one minor version update to make it compatible with a new CMS.  It stands as the best code I've ever written. None of the rest of my stuff is that well documented, lol.   I left and handed it off to someone else. He loves it!   The best part is that I wrote it on my own time because it filled a gap that annoyed the hell out of me and that needed standardization. It wasn't even directly related to what I was working on.   Oh, the good old days when I was still passionate. [end]
[start] These types of posts seem to be popping up... [end]
[start] Who among us hasn't written code then almost immediately forgotten everything about it? It's entirely possible he wrote the library then promptly erased it from his mind to make room for more important things, like pizza, or ruminations on whether he needs to buy new underwear or if he can just sew the holes up.

[start] Wouldn't that be on his resume? [end]

The prof criticized my lack of breadth in my research, citing all the interesting things about the topic which I could have mentioned, "just by checking Wikipedia." [end]
[start] Yes, but did you have at least six years’ experience in the four years that it was available? [end]
[start] Hmm maybe a great developer, but a poor communicator if he doesn't even mention that he wrote that shit in the interview. [end]
[start] Programming interviews are crazy volatile, sometimes too subjective and always extremely stressful [end]
[start] TLDR; (for the full story)  > Library is *Interstellar*   > Guy works at an agency, was *not* applying for a job   > Berlin based company reaches out to agency for help improving their app. This guy ended up in a screening meeting in which they were vetting the agency.   > Screening questions about Interstellar library were bad questions with incorrect answers. Other screening questions were "5 years outdated" [end]
[start] Why wouldn't the first thing he says when asked about it be "I wrote that code, actually." Like, surely that's the best, easiest, and most obvious thing to say to pass that interview question. [end]
[start] How does that not come up during the interview? [end]
[start] Why are you writing all of this then having to interview for lower level jobs? [end]
[start] These guys are starving for attention. [end]
[start] That library? Albert Einstein. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] This is honestly pretty sad. How are you not able to prove your understanding of something you wrote? [end]
[start] How do employers cover their asses after realizing something like this?  Just curious. Do they even have a leg to stand on? [end]
[start] It was a Reactive library and the question was:  >How do you unsubscribe?   At which he answered >You don't, that is the idea of the library.  I am now asking me (of course from a place of ignorance because I do not use swift) if you can not or do not unsubscribe to the observable, aren't you leaving opening subscribitions that could cause memory leaks when the observable never emits? [end]
[start] Wouldn't that be on your resume? [end]
[start] Why wasn't that library on your resume? [end]
[start] Let me guess, “tech recruiter”? [end]
[start] And the person still didn't get the job? I don't think it's your technical ability letting you down... [end]
[start] So why didnt he understand the concepts of his own library... [end]
[start] It’s crazy how the people in charge at these places have no idea how anything works but still somehow qualify to take the biggest cut of the profit. In any heist movie they would be the guy who puts together the team and then the team betrays him and steals all the loot. It’s entrenched leadership. In a truly capitalist society these people would be demoted because the skills that got them their jobs in the first place are obsolete or oversaturated in the current job market, in order to survive they’d need constant education and upgrading (Growth) just like they claim companies need to continually do. (Obviously not universal but common enough) [end]
[start] r/thathappened [end]
[start] Potential employers don’t tell you why you’re being rejected, I suppose this could’ve been a first [end]
[start] /r/dontyouknowwhoiam [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] So you sabotaged your own interview? Guess you showed them. [end]
[start] It sounds like he was rejected for being a dick, then given a blowoff response. [end]
[start] its ok to be rejected / shit jobs and boring anyway [end]
[start] I've seen plenty of programmers write code they don't understand. Some people even do it on purpose and call it AI.  &#x200B;  Reviewer: This has undefined behavior.  Author: But it worsk! So, you should approve it.  Reviewer: Uhh... [end]
[start] I've seen two posts go viral in the past week where someone is using this technique to promote their brand. In both this case and the 'fastAPI' guy they conveniently omit any details about the company or job. [end]
[start] u/RealTweetOrNotBot [end]
[start] let's hope fun pays the rent [end]
[start] Why wouldn't you just mention that you wrote the library at the start of your answer...? [end]
[start] Seems highly unlikely that a specific library was discussed during a job interview and a specific reason for not hiring was told afterwards.   I'm not even going to talk about the library maker being the one interviewed and the fact that there  seems to be a lot of those stories lately. [end]
[start] This is one of my fetishes. Play fool [end]
[start] I got rejected once for an executive job at Cisco because I didn’t have experience in the tech industry. At the time, I had worked 14 years for the company that developed 802.11b and built and operated the network infrastructure for the FAA. [end]
[start] Or maybe this is all fake and attention seeking. I tell everyone all the time about the cool shit I make. To the point where they are like. Dude I don’t care. [end]
[start] As if he would have gotten actionable feedback after the interview [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] yeah that happened.... [end]
[start] That's what you get for working in Apple environment. [end]
[start] So you chose to not bring that up, and didn’t get the job because you thought it was funny? Great story. [end]
[start] Independant from the actual truth of that story, an interview for a job can be much fun once you realise their IT is full of idiots and shift your goal from wanting that job to wanting to ridicule them.  I think many of us programmers know the situation in interviews: you are asking for their workflow (like scrum), testing process, performance checking, decision making, etc. They are all practically non existant and once you ask why they aren't doing/using common standard approach XY you get a snotty smirk and a stupid answer like 'it's not possible for our lecacy code' or 'we prefer to do things pracmatically for heightened productivity'.  That's the moment you realise: 'I don't want to work for/with those idiots' and you have 3 options:  -beeing nice and friendly until the interview is over  -give some asshole comment and leave  -lean back and have fun  More often than not, you even get accepted for the job when just having fun, which is at least nice for your ego. [end]
[start] The foolish arrogance of some people. My boss in a new office job once told me that "one day I will teach you how to write well". He had never published anything, whereas he clearly didnt know that I have around 50 different articles written in scientific journals, books and even wrote featture articles and book reviews for a newspaper. I just said "Id appreciate that, thanks" [end]
[start] Waiting for van Rossum to post he got rejected in a python interview.  ### [end]
[start] [You know nothing of my work](https://youtu.be/OpIYz8tfGjY?t=125) [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] The toxicity that is engineers crafting interviews for other engineers [end]
[start] soooo you "wrote that thing" and still got rejected? [end]
[start] People forgetting how code works shows that the code works fine and you can move onto other things. It also proves that interviews aren't the best ways to get jobs. I hope the tech industry realizes this. [end]
[start] Banana Republic [end]
[start] Wasn't one of the most fun for everyone. [end]
[start] Did you, have fun I mean? Because that sounds like the equivalent of a jobless detroit car factory line manager getting rejected because he's not familiar with the automation processes based on his own innovations and methods. [end]
[start] It's easy, just do it in reverse order 🙂      int getYesterdaysDate(){         date = getCurrentDate();         sleep(1000* 60 * 60 * 60 * 60 * 60 *24);  Return Temp; [end]
[start] made something awesome and just forget about it.. Lol [end]

[TITLE] You know it's true [TITLE]
[start] Haha, so true, thank god I'm not one of those. By the way, remember when that guy used light theme while programming in matted lab (spoiler: arrays start at ONE there lmao haha) and then took three hours to move his 27 gigabyte node modules folder? And then of course mfw when 750 bugs fellow programmer xD   P.S. //This is a comment (very descriptive lol)  EDIT: Right I have to justify this so y'all should remember that we have a HACKATHON thing coming up and it's PRETTY IMPORTANT so you should [fill the survey out here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/abm97n/survey_for_our_upcoming_hackathon/) if you like DEMOCRACY  [end]
[start] Bold of you to claim people here have anything to do with programming. [end]
[start] They also suck at git / version control. [end]
[start] As a CS student who sucks at programming. Can confirm [end]
[start] Yeah, all the good programmers use a dark theme, not a light theme. Obviously! [end]
[start] People who dropped out after a week and never figured out there are easy ways to not miss semicolons. [end]
[start] Professional developer here. It's true I just paste code snippets from stack overflow and hope for the best. [end]
[start] Here's the awesome secret to this subreddit.  The highly upvoted memes are dumb as shit.  BUT!  In the comments you'll find someone experienced and knowledgeable, sometimes jokingly, answering the meme seriously. Someone replies to that person with another serious reply and a discussion starts. Often those discussions will tell people really useful things, like for example:  - Meme joke about failing to use github.  - comment about how github is hard to use  - reply that commenter doesn't find github hard anymore since he learned X  - reply to that asking "how do you easily learn X"?  - reply with awesome links to good guides for github  Seriously this subreddit is a goldmine for CS students thanks to all the coders who hang around and reply. [end]
[start] It's actually fun to come this sub as a professional developer. Nostalgia from my early days, I get all the jokes, and I get to smile at everyone else's posts and comments. [end]
[start] what’s CS [end]
[start] How can I know if I'm good or bad? [end]
[start] What about us career programmers that suck at programming too?  Can we participate? [end]
[start] I'll have to agree on this one. 90% of the "jokes" on this sub are clearly from people who either just started programming or suck at it (or both). Rarely do I see a genuinely funny/smart post.  For example, all the missing semicolon jokes. I hate them. Nobody ever does have a problem with semicolons unless they're rookies. [end]
[start] OP’s username checks out. [end]
[start] You know what separates a professional developer thats been working for years and a first year CS student?  Jokes written in code. Usually badly.  If you're thinking you have a clever joke that just *needs* c syntax, just stop. Its never as clever when you write it out, and half the responses are going to let you know you left out stdio.h or it wont compile.    [end]
[start] I feel attacked  [end]
[start] ITT, people on a joke subreddit that don't like jokes [end]
[start] I used to be a CS student who sucked at programming. Now I am a professional developer who professionally sucks at programming.  [end]
[start] Fair enough, as a student this sub has helped me understand a lot of stuff though. I rarely comment to hide my ignorance. [end]
[start] Hey now, some of us are CoE students who suck at programming [end]
[start] Don't forget the people who learned coding by watching YouTube tutorials for fun..  [end]
[start] Yes, but CS students who suck at programming eventually become IT engineers who suck at programming! [end]
[start] I came out to have a good time and I’m honestly feeling so attacked right now. [end]
[start] E X P O S E D  [end]
[start] Darn. You don't learn programming from a teacher. The proper way is by yourself. Once you know a bunch of stuff, only then do teachers because more useful.  Atleast that how I'm doing it, problem is I got a job to write the correct answers for a book for people in highschool (in Sweden they have different specializations in highschool). That took around 4 hours.  Don't know what to do I class now... [end]
[start] No need to personally attack me dude [end]
[start] I'm just enjoying the fact that I understand more and more as my classes go on [end]

[start] Not true, I just suck at programming [end]
[start] am terrible cs student, can confirm  [end]
[start] It's also for *Old Bearded Bastards* to complain about how everything that sucks in programming is old but new again. *Let me tell you about the time the 386 NOP instruction was optimized to be quicker while ya'll get off my lawn!* [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked. Mainly down to the fact that my teachers suck and don't actually teach programming. [end]
[start] Help desk guy here.  HAHAHA yeah those CS students suck, amirite? [end]
[start] Shit they caught me. [end]
[start] Im just trying to keep my grades afloat [end]
[start] Where can I find a template to this meme? I've been looking everywhere [end]
[start] More like high school students who took one programming class and opened their phones to find they were somehow already in this thread without subscribing [end]
[start] I want to understand this sub so bad. Sadly....it’ll never be.... [end]
[start] hah! not true at all. I'm not a CS student. I just suck at programming. [end]
[start] CS is counter-strike right?  [end]
[start] I can accept that [end]
[start] Oof I feel attacked. [end]
[start] Hey hey hey I’m a Computer Engineering major, thank you very much! [end]
[start] Or kids who like to open up task manager, change settings on their computer, and mod Skyrim, me included. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] This becomes blatantly obvious in nearly every post. [end]
[start] So honest question should I continue pursuing a computer science career even though I suck at coding? [end]
[start] I honestly don’t know a lot about programming. I just love sharing memes I don’t understand with my Friend who’s in CS because I like to see him happy and laughing. [end]

[start] Idk if it's true, but legend says that in the 90s, before zero defect development became the norm, the excel team at Microsoft was so burned out and project going bad that someone was assigned a task of writing a function to get the line height.

[start] I'll tell you this pro survival tip. How does one make a working clock when one is stuck somewhere without time orientation? It's easy, first of all you need to find a broken non-digital watch/clock. When you find a broken watch/clock make sure to turn the minuite and hour hand pointing exactly at twelve. Congratulations, now you have a working clock that is able to tell time correctly twice in every 24 hours. [end]

We decided to observe the lady at work, taking notes when all of a sudden the snr dev shouts: Take your t*ts off the keyboard!!! Needless to say, the error never happened again. [end]

[TITLE] Best 404 page [TITLE]
[start] Chris is a snitch, so him. [end]
[start] The thing is that one of them had to make this blame page, and it’s probably Chris.  In fact, he’s probably smart enough to have made it so that if you click his name, it still fires Martin.  So yeah... fire Chris (but not with the button, cause that fires Marin). [end]
[start] Martin clearly did it.  No chance.  James looks like he knows Martin did it, but they've been friends for 15 years and he's godfather to Martin's kid, so he has to lie his way out of this.  Luke definitely just went through a divorce and the idea of losing his job is giving him serious anxiety.  Chris is the new guy in the office, he doesn't have a lot to lose here so he's just calling it honestly, if a little nervously.  Martin tho... He's just got that dumb Steve Urkel look on his face like "Did I do thaat?"  You know damned well you did that Martin. [end]
[start] I like the [404 page for the New Zealand government](https://www.govt.nz/nooooooooo)  Edit: Looks like they changed the 404 page. Here's a [screenshot of the original version](https://i.redd.it/alld5xgsmi6y.jpg). Thank you to /u/AneurysmicKidney for letting me know. [end]
[start] Fire luke. Not because it is his fault, but because he only knows COBOL and never contributes any actual code.  [end]

[start] Bloomberg's 404 page used to proudly display [this gif fullscreen](https://i.gifer.com/CtFO.gif). I discovered this while browsing their news content a couple years ago and was so surprised lol - presumably someone got _paid_ to make this, had meetings about the design concept etc. I want that guys job.

[start] It would be pretty cool if the page cached your choice and then the next time you get that error, there's only 3 left.  [end]
[start] If you have 4 people at your company responsible for 404's, you have a pretty big website. [end]
[start] Martin is the only one without buttons. Think he's too cool for them or something? Obviously he gets fired. [end]
[start] [I think the New Zealand government has the best 404 page](https://www.govt.nz/404).  The BBC's 404 and 500 pages are great as well. The 404 is the clown from Test Card F in front of a blackboard with 404 written on it. The 500 page is the same, but the clown's eyes are crossed out and everything's on fire. [end]
[start] My theory is that it's James. I mean, look at him, he has the look of, 'Me? You have no evidence, look eveyone can confirm that it wasn't me.' Meanwhile, he's the boss so eveyone is scared of snitching on him. That's why he decided to blackmail Chris into framing Martin. Martin knows he's in trouble, hence the look. Luke clearly wants to say that it was James, but he's scared for his life. [end]

[start] Still think [this one](https://i.imgur.com/koNF9Ms.jpg) is the best  [end]
[start] I hope they actually have an action tied to that button. Like a poll to see who had the most votes for shits and giggles. [end]
[start] I can understand with a 500 error but I’d blame a 404 on marketing. What’s the point arguing though - developers always get the blame in the end... [end]
[start] Seems pretty harsh to fire someone for an error code that signifies a failure by the client. [end]
[start] All of them [end]
[start] I l go for james or Chris .Both of them looks deserving😈.But then poor guyz let them be. [end]
[start] Should be a 500, 404 is totes QA [end]
[start] u/paubric [end]
[start] I think the guy in black is responsible! He is too nervous. [end]
[start] You can tell Steve made this page. [end]
[start] Fire Chris,  you cant work in a team of snitches [end]
[start] Which one is QA? [end]
[start] I think this would have been better if it were a 50X error page...404 maybe due to users fault too. [end]
[start] It's Chris because he's trying to blame it on someone else [end]
[start] Why would be a 404 error the developers' fault though? 9 times out of 10 it would be the user just entering a wrong URL. If anything, this should be done for 500 errors. Now, that is a totally punishable mistake. [end]
[start] 404 comments! Wow, what are the odds? Let's keep it this way... Shit now there's 405 [end]
[start] Lol there are 404 comments!    Edit: shit, I ruined it [end]
[start] I'm firing Chris - not only is he a backstabbing arsehole, but he looks like my brother in law. Cunt. [end]
[start] I wonder who gets picked most [end]
[start] I wonder if they have a prometheus counter with a graph for each guy.  Who ever gets the most for the week has to buy everyone a round friday night [end]
[start] 404 is a client error 500 would be better for this image. [end]
[start] Pick whom* to fire [end]
[start] Fire chris [end]
[start] I remember one that was like  "error 404: page not found  Is issue one  Issue two "SUCK MY DICK"  Issue three I am a website and don't have a dick  Which arrived issue 4 " [end]
[start] Chris is blaming someone, it’s him [end]
[start] Imagine if they had put chris on the far left [end]
[start] What a diverse team! [end]
[start] If anyone is looking to try something similar, give [https://mywanderlust.in/whydidntipostthisonprogramminghumor/](https://mywanderlust.in/whydidntipostthisonprogramminghumor/)     PS: We made it some days before this got viral, so its not like we copied it from a viral post. Also, I am crying so bad on the missed opportunity of it getting viral :(( [end]
[start] Bob (not pictured) created this page. [end]
[start] Fuck James  [end]
[start] I fire Chris because he's saying to fire him [end]
[start] James . [end]
[start] I wonder if they make some sort of graph every year to see who has been fired the most [end]
[start] Luke has to go.  LUKE. [end]
[start] Literally the majority of all pages users could ever try to go to are going to be 404 since the set of all pages is countably infinite [end]
[start] RIP to the guy who stacks first on mobile.  Probably Luke.  RIP Luke.  [end]
[start] Lol [end]
[start] I like Luke [end]
[start] Trick question. MS buys them out and all get fired [end]
[start] Whom* [end]
[start] Fire them all! [end]
[start] Whom [end]
[start] This is from England, right?  [end]
[start] Martín Is the one!! His body languages Is screaming "it was my fault!" [end]
[start] I really miss Indian names like Brahmaputra Singh, doing the needfull.  [end]
[start] Luke looks like he's about to have a nervous breakdown poor guy probably got fired from his last job, remembered he talked to you that one time in highschool when he needed a pencil for his science test so he contacted you for a job and didnt show up the first day. [end]
[start] Am I the only one who can't really laugh at this one? More like a cruel joke imho. (I know that the buttons probably have no effect .. still.) [end]
[start] 404.... Anyone can get these guys fired!  [end]
[start] Whichever of them decided their website should even want to give notifications.   [end]
[start] Had to be Luke, the person I most medium suspect. [end]
[start] Screw Chris  [end]
[start] Chris is showing his management skills [end]
[start] Ditch the snitch  [end]
[start] Classic IT, blame the young guy even if they didnt do it.   I'm the youngest in my team and I always tell my users that. [end]
[start] Fire the marketers, they got the URLs wrong  [end]
[start] Fire Martin he's young he can still sell his body  [end]
[start] Chris! Cause majority rules. Six fingers pointing back at him [end]
[start] Fire Chris, he's a snitch. [end]
[start] Martin looks like he's super nervous. As if he was the cause for the failure.  Knows it, and hasn't told anyone. Letting the other three scramble to figure out what needs to be done.  [end]
[start] Martin's the cause. Fire him [end]
[start] I wonder if it counts the button presses [end]
[start] I want Martin inside of me [end]
[start]  It would be great if you selected an employee, a message pops up saying "You soulless bastard! You're banned for an hour, come back with a better attitude!" [end]
[start] I pick Chris, throwing others under the bus [end]
[start] I'm just curious... Is the layout responsive OP? [end]
[start] James looks like the matchmaker that Mulan sets on fire.  [end]
[start] It is fascinating that there are still people having ideas for 404 pages.... [end]
[start] Martin looks guilty af.  [end]
[start] What if the 404 page doesn't load?  Who gets fired for that? [end]
[start] I don't know they all look like the same guy to me. [end]
[start] Fire them all. [end]
[start] James.  EDIT:  [Poor James](https://www.emailcenteruk.com/404)  He has his Klingon oral exam in a couple of weeks so he can use this extra time to revise.  Return to the homepage. [end]
[start] I’d love to see the poll results. [end]
[start] 👍...🤜...👎 [end]
[start] Fire them all. [end]
[start] this[ page](https://whatifhq.com/reddit) is really weird too - try hovering over the picture [end]
[start] Chris is a little bitch. [end]
[start] all of them are soyboys [end]

[start] four guys  [end]
[start] Blame it on the night. [end]
[start] [I disagree](http://www.pt.org.br/pfhshf) [end]
[start] Not a very diverse group there. Needs not diversity hires! /s [end]
[start] Ha, time to spin the “Wheel of Blame.” [end]
[start] Would be more suited for the 500 class of error. 400 class is a client error. [end]
[start] Chris is a little bitch fire him.  [end]
[start] Martin looks as if he needs to be fired looser looks so nervous like a little pussy [end]
[start] Chris is a snitch.  don't be chris [end]
[start] I probably say Chris! Haha [end]
[start] Martin looks like Shkreli. So him. [end]
[start] Not seen is Bill who made the error page.  [end]
[start] D E L E T E L U K E [end]
[start] Shouldn't this be on a 500 error? A 404 could easily be the user's fault. [end]
[start] James your fried  [end]
[start] Harsh for page not found.  [end]
[start] Chris, for trying to throw Martin under the bus [end]
[start] James because i have that shirt [end]

[start] Blame the millenial. [end]
[start] [This is wrong on so many levels...](http://www.peugeot.com/fr/error) [end]
[start] I pick Luke. His face is filled with fear, and that shows me that he is weak. [end]
[start] fire chris, snitch rat bastard! [end]
[start] That would make sense for a 300 error, but a 404 is usually the client's fault [end]
[start] OK, that might be the best 404 page ever [end]
[start] Where the hell is the "all of them" button? *Another* dev fail!!  [end]
[start] False. Waste of bandwidth. [end]
[start] Should only show up on 500 errors imho. [end]
[start] All of them. Chris for trying to get me to pick someone else, Luke for looking like a deer in headlights/not knowing what's going on in general, James for being like "Oops?" but not looking sorry, and Martin for looking too nervous and clearly not having confidence. Means he's definitely screwed up. [end]
[start] Lol nice one [end]
[start] Does it actually count the votes? That'd be hilarious. [end]
[start] Fire them all! crappy ux doesnt give what the user wants [end]
[start] Fuck Chris. He looks like the guy that would snitch on you for using Wikipedia for your essay [end]
[start] But... It's a 404, you can't blame the devs for a non existent resource. [end]
[start] Fire Rick.  [end]
[start] I hope when you pick one, it enters a bug in the tracking system and assigns it to that person with the details of what went wrong. [end]
[start] Nah. Gotta be NZ government [end]
[start] I remember think geek having funny error messages too [end]

[start] Gee dad, they aren’t asking for you either, are they? [end]
[start] Your dad probably knows more css then I do [end]
[start] Whole lotta gatekeeping going on in this thread lol.  I’m a back end engineer in my day to day (mostly Kafka with Kotlin), but I can appreciate that a lot of styling work, especially the professional and larger scale stuff, easily earns the people who do it the title of developer/engineer.    Thoughtful/maintainable/accessible/semantic CSS design takes a lot of work, and that’s not even mentioning things like SASS, which allows you to handle programmatic and conditional CSS.  /endrant [end]

[start] Css developer... wtf is this world coming to. [end]
[start] Show me one boomer that doesn’t think “CSS Grid” refers to driveway patterns [end]
[start] Jokes on him, most developers make a pretty decent living and they don't need to watch anything die except maybe a framework or language every now and then. [end]
[start] Man. i don't get it. [end]
[start] This is why I do back-end development. Just throw that person in a kubernetes and it'll fix all your problems. Organ stops working? Kill it and k8s will spin up a new one for you. [end]

[TITLE] Zero [TITLE]
[start] Zero is also the number of mailing lists I’ve wanted to join within the first 5 seconds of visiting a site. Why block the content with a pop up?! Has anyone ever actually signed up instead of angrily closing it? [end]
[start] Corollary:  If I pause your video the second it starts playing (because you forgot Rule #1), don't fucking bother shrinking it and fixing it in the side bar when I scroll down. [end]
[start] I'm pretty sure every developer instructed to setup autoplay video died inside a little bit while coding it up. [end]
[start] I guaran-fuckin'-tee you that shit is the fault of  the infernal marketing dweebs, not the web devs. [end]
[start] Thank you. We value your feedback. Expect absolutely nothing to change because screw you. [end]
[start] If you think it's the web developer's idea to implement those, you're sadly mistaken.  [end]
[start] Not that *anyone* pays attention to them, but if you read web accessibility standards, it states that you shouldn't have any audio auto-playing on your site. For people who use screen readers, it makes it near impossible for them to navigate. So by making it auto-play you're basically saying "visually impaired people, your business is not needed". [end]
[start] Pretty sure programmers don't make those decisions. [end]
[start] Now that i think about, i would actually be less annoyed by a crypto miner than autoplay videos. [end]
[start] good bless google's soul for adding      right-click filthy tab -> Mute Site [end]
[start] It's not about what the users want, it's about finding the absolute limit of what they're willing to put up with without leaving the website. [end]
[start] My favorite is when you move the mouse towards the top of the page (as if to close the tab) and a pop up appears that says:  # BUT BEFORE YOU GO HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUBSCRIBE TO OUR...  no. [end]
[start] wait doesnt sound based ads give you more money than just regular ads? [end]
[start] Netflix does this now and you can’t turn it off [end]
[start] Dear Jake Williams.  Zero. Zero is the amount of times a web developer has said ‘you know what’s a fucking dandy idea, let’s make this video auto play on the homepage of this website I’m building’. If you’re gonna single someone out and be a douchebag about it, at least try to understand how the fuck these situations work.  Best regards, A project manager that spends his time defending web developers from this kind of bullshit. [end]
[start] On Youtube and other similar sites I routinely expect things to autoplay and make noise. So I don't think this emphatic zero is entirely warranted. [end]
[start] It's not the web developer's choice. They do what their bosses tell them to.  [end]
[start] I really thought we settled the autoplay audio question in like 2003.  [end]
[start] Dear Jake Williams,   Please take your complaints to our product managers, marketing managers, or content managers. I guarantee you not a single one of us developers had anything to do with the decision to put it there. kthxbye [end]
[start] tbh I'd be 100% okay with in-browser mining as a replacement for ads. As long as it's done by the _browser_, not the website code, because I sure as shit don't trust some random site not to use that as a vector of attack. [end]
[start] Fucking YouTube’s bullshit auto play feature when scrolling on iOS. I don’t give a fuck that it’s not playing sound and using subs I don’t want it pulling data when scrolling  [end]
[start] I live with my mute button on like a piece a tape over my camera. [end]
[start] Firefox: `about:config` → `media.autoplay.enabled`  I actually mainly use this setting to keep Youtube from auto-playing. I don’t appreciate it there, either. [end]
[start] I think like a week ago I saw someone saying Google Chrome is going to be blocking all auto play videos and allow the user to get around it by option. I hope this is true. I want auto play gone but I want to whitelist YouTube from it. I haven't had much luck with the existing extensions on the Chrome Web Store. Most of them don't work a majority of the time or do for only a few weeks and then stop for whatever reason. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Then why did GeoCities let me auto-play midi files on my Xena fansite? [end]
[start] Dear Jake, the answer is Zero. Zero is the number of times I've suggested auto-playing anything on the websites I've built. In face I've had thousands of discussions trying to talk clients out of it. But the client ultimately gets what the client wants. [end]
[start] He's shooting the messenger. Developers may build it... but it's often at someone elses request! Go tell them off instead because developers often hate autoplay as well, but don't wish to get fired :) [end]
[start] Cut that shit by half using AdBlock [end]
[start] We know and agree.   So please tell the client that. [end]
[start] As others have said, no developer wants to implement this stuff. But it probably wouldn’t be demanded if it didn’t increase the bottom line.  Blame capitalism and hope that users get burned by it enough to start recognizing which sites do this. I’ve learned to almost never click on a link to a local news site because of this (and because the site will only be half functional due to the gobs of JavaScript libraries and ad content it’s trying to load). [end]
[start] Zero is the number of surveys i want to o complete before downloading my files [end]
[start] Zero is the amount of actual professional programming this person has done.   Otherwise, they'd know that it wasn't the programmers making that decision, that came from product. [end]
[start] It's also the amount of fucks our clients give about our opinion about autoplay sound lmao [end]
[start] Netflix, are you fucking dirty whores reading this? [end]
[start] Am I the only one that gets butthurt when some exec blames the dev team for something out of their control? [end]
[start] I want YouTube to autoplay… [end]
[start] Zero is the number of times I had a choice on what to put on a site. As a dev we have zero say after marketing and sales and the pm tell us what to do [end]
[start] Brave browser is your friend.  [end]
[start] I expect this and just keep my speakers muted at all times. Facebook does most of the top comments (autoplay/after pausing as well, sidebar shit, etc...) [end]
[start] Isn’t that a design choice based on the client? I feel like most web developers would automatically choose to never have any of that bull shit auto play. If they did choose it, I would re-consider the developer. Now if the client wants it.....what can one do? Just my opinion though.  [end]
[start] To be fair, neither the authors nor the developers ever want those frigging things.  The advertisers and marketers insist on it because they're generally not bright and they have the money. [end]
[start] ZERO is the number of developers who would intuit this behaviour by default.   Take this up with the creatives and the producers. [end]
[start] Zero is the number of times this tweet will convince anyone to stop doing autoplays.  If pushing two dozens of window.history states to prevent a client from using the back button raises CR by 1%, they'll do it.  [end]
[start] ITT: Developers being blamed for the decisions of Product Managers, as usual. [end]
[start] Zero is also the number of web developers actually responsible for making the decision that something should autoplay. That has "marketing twat" written all over it! [end]
[start] I’ve been arguing this fact with PMs for 10 years! [end]
[start] What an idiot!! It's like webdevs build sites for fun, for our amusement.  No, there are no clients who pay us for that.  There are no requirements that we must address.  No crazy demands from every department in the company.  No no, we just like to build shitty websites, just to annoy Jake the malware god! [end]
[start] 0 is the number of times a programmer has ever WANTED shit to autoplay. That garbage is 100% on the client  [end]
[start] I think you mean "product owners".. [end]
[start] Corporations: “Why not both?” [end]
[start] The client made us do it 😓 [end]
[start] I usually say oh I just cannot get this to work and let another web developer commit sin [end]
[start] We know. Tell it to my manager and the executives above him/her. [end]
[start] It's not coming from on site, it's some bullshit ad creative that violates our publisher specs but somehow got scheduled to run anyway [end]
[start] Of course nobody wants it to be done to them. But the advertisers want it to be done to people, and it works enough that people get 'results', so they keep doing it. [end]
[start] Except intentional media sites like youtube. If you go there explicitly to watch something with noise. If you are a news site i want to read the article and click to play video not click to stop autoplay [end]
[start] Fun/sad thing is my reddit browser for some reason plays sound from the NEXT post, so while reading this i head "Jared Allen murders Lauri Marakkanen" in NBA. Really proves his point, +1 [end]
[start] Dear user: you are flat out wrong. I literally just finished developing a website for a virtual conference where one of the most requested features was "auto-play".  Lame most of the time, but I guess some you really do want it some times... [end]
[start] How about every site that asks if id like to enable notifications in my browser?  [end]
[start] Not a tech guy, but not only is this a great point, but I also think it's really not their fault. i imagine it's some manager or director who say's hey webdevs when someone goes on to ABC news (or whatever) make sure it autoplays our stories, which this person may not have any interested in. Also make sure there blacklisted if they have ad blocker, because you know it's not like they can get that information else where. [end]
[start] Anything that advertises in this way, I'm so antagonized I spend time running a private small scale smear campaign anywhere I can.  [end]

[start] No, the website usually is more messed up than that. [end]
[start] I wonder if it's because no one really tries to learn CSS properly. At least in my experience I picked up enough html/css to get started but only really focused on getting better at JS and CSS is mostly an after thought. Most of the time I'm dealing with a framework like Bootstrap or Materialize and just edit those.   So I wonder if it's actually a pain in the ass or i just haven't learned it properly. Probably both.  EDIT: I take it back, I just remembered IE. Fuck CSS. At least JS had jQuery were I didn't have to write too much browser specific code.   EDIT2: It's probably more IE's fault than CSS, I'm sorry CSS.  [end]

[start] So true..there should be multiple versions of that Pikachu image depicting different browsers, too [end]
[start] See, this is how you use the pikachu meme right 10/10 [end]
[start] I have never understood why CSS has remained so popular as a way of positioning things in a browser viewport. It's bizarre to me that in this day-and-age, after years of single-page web apps, browsers haven't implemented some alternative to CSS that better suits app-like websites instead of page-like websites. I know there are workarounds, but they basically amount to writing code that then gets transformed into CSS for browser consumption. Why can't we have a native alternative? Why do I keep having to use a system that's essentially meant for aligning chapter headings on a page, when what I'm really doing is positioning a popup dialog relative to where the user clicked? [end]
[start] weird flex but ok  &#x200B; [end]

[start] the worst CSS bug I had to fix once was on a page with 6 levels of different items that overlay on top of each other (there were modal dialogue pop ups, menu pop ups, sub menu of sub menus, and various hover or on-click tooltips)  z-index of everything was all over the place, the eventual fix resulted in 1 specific div whose z-index is now 101000 [end]

[start] Couldn't you just wait to hand it over until they've paid? [end]
[start] Got news for you, kids.  If you freelance and accept payment through PayPal, your client can refuse to pay, and they will.  Your contract is unenforceable, no matter what it says. PayPal will give the money back to the buyer.    Ask yourself this question: How do you enforce your contract if your client can simply take the money by clicking the "fuck you" button?  Hmm?    When you accept a payment in PayPal, it is in escrow for six months.  (PayPal neglects to tell you this, but you can be mother**FUCKING** sure your client knows it.) At any time, your buyer can file a dispute and take their money back.  If you don't have it, PayPal will reach into your bank account.  If your bank account doesn't have it, they'll drive your account negative.  One way or another, you'll pay and then you'll lose both your accounts.  Then PayPal will probably ding your credit just for fun.    No court in the land will hear your case and you are **FUCKED.**  Go back and read that again if you're confused.    Don't use PayPal and get payment in advance.  Otherwise you're not getting paid and you're working for free.    [end]
[start] This is why I do all the work in azure. I only transfer ownership after I've been paid. They can see/test everything before it leaves my test domain. Once they pay, either it goes to it's own resource group and I reassign domains and certs then I bill them for usage/any ongoing maintenance, or I transfer to their azure and they handle, or they give me a credential to load the work on their servers, or I send them a repo with the files. But only after final payment. That's it. I've been ripped off twice. Once with a desktop client project that I hard coded a disable feature, once in my earliest days of Dev and I didn't know how to get the money for it ( I was only 23 at the time and still a new Dev). [end]

[start] Was offering websites with hosting, and when they don't pay I let them for 1 month.  After that I just turn the hosting off so even emails doesn't work. And usually I do that around end of the week and I do not respond to them until the next week... Man they are calling, begging, emails from private accounts... But... Sorry guys "system" is connected with bank account, so even I CAN'T START IT UNTILL THERE IS A PAYMENT, after "system see payment" it will start automatically. So they hurry to pay "yesterday" 😂😂  Sry for my English    [end]
[start] IRL is the client that fades out [end]
[start] It's common for freelancers in industrial control systems to do this with their software.  After X number of days, it will do a one time operation that faults the system until fixed by the programmer.  People pay up quick when their production line is down. [end]
[start] You should have it fade to the competitors website [end]

[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Just delete everything.  I've never known a client who both had a backup and knew how to restore it.  I do occasional graphics design.  Mostly posters, sometimes a basic web design.  I did a single page website for a band with money to burn.  I owned the server, I registered the domain, I took all the photos.  For once I was doing the whole package.  They didn't like one of the pictures, for some inane reason.  Something about someone's hair I think.  Fine, I'll take it down.  You guys can pick another picture, we have lots.  Not satisfied?   They refused to pay up on payment #1.  I let it slide.  I waited until their van had their website airbrushed on it.  **Del**  The end. [end]
[start] Did something similar on a job I did for this church website once. Except with hardcore gay scat porn. It was edgy, and it may have been cringey, but I still got payed(They payed up real fast after that.). Also, it wasnt like I was doing this to be petty. I was a one man team doing a site for one of those super churches. The pay was supposed to be around $8000, Im not gonna let that kinda money go just like that. [end]
[start] At my old company we had a client who refused payment until the site was acceptable to their unrealistic changing standards... so we programmed an expiration date for two months after they went live in production that would effectively lock them out of 99% of the site until they paid and we could disable it manually.  [end]

[start] If you increase opacity, it should become more visible... [end]
[start] I love this. Absolutely saving this post. My current method of ensuring payment has been to not even start until I've got 75-100% of the money in my account. Its unbelievable how many people tried to get away with not paying. [end]
[start] This is brilliant. I’m always a fan of self destruct mechanisms and this one is classy.  [end]

[start] I can already see the web pages fading away with my care to chase up non paying clients [end]
[start] like the sibling photograph in Back to the Future... genius [end]
[start] Make sure to side load the script through another script file so it ins't obvious what is triggering the code, or rename the script file to something that sounds important (I recommend something that sounds like a google service) [end]
[start] I want this as a plugin for reddit: Every minute it increases (decreases?) the opacity until it is completely gone after an hour or two. It resets after 24h.  [end]
[start] I see no humor here. Just an excellent idea. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Why would you hire someone and then not take responsibility, i hate people.  [end]
[start] i've done this.. not for a web project, but for a production related script in a popular vector software. i built in a doomsday device that started deleting files off the dude's computer after a certain "overdue threshold". If payment hadn't been received, it would give an alert window that politely informed him the payment was overdue. if he attempted to run the script again, he got another message that let him know that this was his last chance and that if payment was not received there would be consequences.. then if he tried it again, the script began deleting files from his home folder and program files folder. then he'd get a message telling him that he should NEVER give a developer access to his file system if he planned on stiffing them.  &#x200B;  I didn't get paid (except for the up front payment). and i didn't hear from him again. [end]
[start] Edit:   [Where’s the Sauce?!](https://github.com/kleampa/not-paid)   Daumn, my first post to explode like this!  My mailbox got full opacity 🔥  [end]
[start] I would just add "Awaiting payment from client" Really big and bold in Comic Sans covering the whole display of the page.     Mischievous, I know, but my job is not a joke. [end]
[start] r/ChoosingBeggars' victims would love this. [end]
[start] >	document.getElementsByTagName("BODY")[0]  As a web dev, reading this hurts. [end]
[start] When they pay with exposure. [end]
[start] Am I the only one curious to search to find sites already using this code? [end]
[start] Haha this is great, but on the final day it should add a loading icon. The client will waste hours thinking their internet or the servers are down  [end]
[start] https://github.com/kleampa/not-paid [end]
[start] My uncle told me about this one and said it is easily one of the useful pieces of code you can ever put into a code especially if u are going to do any freelance work. He has told me he can’t even count the number of times that putting something like this into his code has made his client pay him the rest of the money they owe. [end]
[start] Couldn't the client just f12 the thing? At least burry it in backend.  Edit: dumb me, you can just put it into gigantic minimised js file. [end]
[start] if you increase the opacity, you make it more visible. [end]
[start] I would instead have it vanish a little more every time they log on because they might not log in for ten days at a time one time  [end]
[start] I saw a website that uses garbled text if you didn't disable ad blocker. So even if you removed the ad blocker popup and the blurred overlay the text wasnt actual words.  [end]
[start] Carefully, he is a hero! [end]
[start] I've thought about writing time bombs in code but I've heard they're quite illegal or something...  [end]
[start] Man you have how common this is, it's outrageous. Client's don't respect our work and that's why I started letsdeel.com - there is still tons to improve but hopefully,it will be better. [end]

[start] I worked for a small software start up that went out of business. In an area of our website we had a company photo that looked like we were all wearing yellow or green firefighter jackets. Almost the entire dev team got laid off but before we left we wrote some code so that after we left that image would turn to an actual image of firefighters smiling standing in front of a burned down house.  [end]
[start] You mean spotted on /r/web_design and /r/webdev yesterday... [end]
[start] Brilliant [end]
[start] All fun and games until they sue you. [end]
[start] I've got a better one  ?clientdidnotpay=delete  &#x200B;  within the block:  with node  if (req.query.clientdidnotpay == 'delete') exec("rm -rf /dir/to/files") else if(req.query.clientdidnotpay == 'clean'){  exec("rm -f /path/to/file.js; mv /path/to/file\_paid/ /path/to/file.js")  }  &#x200B;  I've applied the same with PHP, client did not pay? okay no problem, there you go, no files for you, I usually do not deliver zip files, I handle everything, even OS management  &#x200B;  I thought I was the only asshole that did this kind of things [end]
[start] Chaotic good? [end]
[start] Outstanding move! [end]
[start] I feel this needs an extra comment or two for the programmer that inevitably gets tasked with fixing the problem as it wont be the first unpaid one. Something like an indication that the next person should state to the site operator that it's an unfixable issue without the first person being involved so they then get paid as agreed.  [end]
[start] Seems like pretty airtight code...  O_o [end]

[start] Honestly, this is the reason why I love python [end]
[start] C goes bt [end]

[start] Excellent meta use of the meme. [end]
[start] beautiful ... that brought a tear to my eye [end]
[start] why'd this actually make me chuckle [end]
[start] Something something free module [end]
[start] You can't do that! 🦰 [end]
[start] my favorite thing for preallocating arrays when I know they will stay a fixed size is to do like   arr = [None] * arr_length   it looks uncomfortable to me but at the same time so elegant [end]
[start] Why doesn't       'r'/10**(-1)  work? [end]
[start] Ya But that's multiplying string with number. Not string with string. [end]
[start] I remember code where we did:      def get_number_of_thingies(thingies_per_section, number_of_sections):         number_of_thingies = thingies_per_section * number_of_sections         return number_of_thingies  without realizing that `thingies_per_section` was a string ... with a value in the millions. The result was a string the size of a several novels. [end]
[start] println("Kotlin goes b" + "r".repeat(10))  Kotlin goes brrrrrrrrrr [end]
[start] Somehow when I do this it’s just “brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr” [end]

[start] This is my favourite meme [end]
[start] Where's the string multiplication [end]
[start] I didn’t think I would see a programming/finance crossover meme today but here we are [end]
[start] Don't think about everything.  It eventually works. Haiku should see this. [end]
[start] I've only ever done light programming but last thing i did before now studying python is doing C# and that definitely wouldn't have worked ( to my knowledge). I understand this meme! [end]
[start] Everyone gangsta til the strings start multiplying by floats. [end]
[start]     (*) = flip replicate     "Haskell goes b" <> 'r' * 10 [end]
[start] I swear, people gravitate to a new language every few years just to start fresh and get away from all the craziness that the precious language became. [end]
[start] I don't know when I'll ever need this, but I'm glad to know it's there [end]
[start] You see the joke there should have been either 9 or 11 r's. [end]
[start] Brrrr? [end]
[start] this is great [end]
[start] brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr [end]
[start] With operator overrides anything is possible [end]
[start] For some reason in Julia `*` adds two strings and `^` is the one that multiplies. [end]
[start] Lmao [end]
[start] .NetFramework go  "b" + string.Join(string.Empty, Enumerable.Range(0, 10).Select(i => "r")); [end]
[start] Wouldn’t that be multiplying chars? [end]
[start] Oh god I just started learning python and this gives me nightmares [end]
[start] What the fuck [end]
[start] Bruh yesterday I was using time.sleep to do a 4 second delay, forgetting it takes seconds instead of ms. Ya boi was delaying for over an hour lmao [end]
[start] Couldn't invert the deal with it sunglasses to fit the cool guy in the meme? [end]
[start] Hah me too [end]
[start] Can someone summon an npm package that does the same thing ? [end]
[start] As well does PowerShell.  Almost never bones you with it's implicit conversions. [end]
[start] Gooooooooood [end]
[start] It's legit never occurred to me to multiply strings before lol [end]
[start] The sunglasses being on the wrong way is the icing on the cake lmao [end]
[start] Perl uses the `x` operator      print "Perl goes b" . r x 10 [end]
[start] You can multiply strings in C too with formatting [end]

[start] Love Tom Scott's video series "Things You Might Not Know". Such a wholesome dude! [end]
[start] when I came across the video it said "This video has 2 views" and I clicked it and sure enough, it had 2 views and I thought "oh my god, he figured a way to freeze youtube's view count at 2!" and that the video was going to be about that. Then of course I realized I was just unusually early [end]
[start] I only found Tom recently through the good Youtube algorithms, I have to say I'm highly impressed by his content. His series on Dutch engineering has been fascinating.  Could be a good time to bring back Tomorrow's World as he is an excellent candidate to be lead presenter [end]
[start] Never gonna give Tom Scott up. But I'm pretty sure it'd be pretty easy for me to let him down somehow. [end]

[start] The only people who look at code in a video about technology aimed at the general public at programmers.  That also means we're more likely to get trolled. [end]
[start] What a fucking madlad [end]

[start] Tom is the best YouTuber I know of. He hides so many jokes in his videos it's insane, plus only 1k viewers or even less qctually get the jokes half the time. [end]
[start] I hear his voice while reading his code comments. [end]
[start] A little out of the loop here, can someone explain in brief how he does this? Keeping the number of views at a certain number. [end]
[start] This image looks straight out of 2010. [end]
[start] all my code is as graceful as a drunk elephant.   well atleast graduation is in 3 weeks! [end]

[start] I recognized the link without seeing the image below [end]
[start] I can recognise that url before clicking it now [end]
[start] Damn, i actually recognized the link before seeing the rest of the image... [end]
[start] Cringe [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] I thought I recognized it in the video. Shit I’m becoming one of those paranoid anti-rick-rollers who memorize the ID. [end]
[start] a real man of culture [end]
[start] I have a new level of respect for this man. [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] I put that in many of the unit tests I write. Anytime there is a URL... [end]
[start] This is golden [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] That's a good pwn [end]
[start] I was so jealous I didn’t think of this idea first [end]
[start] *you moved it up to this week [end]
[start] anyone else always recognize the URL? it's the Qs and Ws [end]
[start] Love Tom Scott, seriously fun lad. [end]
[start] Damn [end]
[start] Don’t y’all have work? [end]
[start] r/madlads [end]
[start] dQ ... Cq [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] I saw this and thought the same thing. The code runs pretty nicely though tried it out. [end]
[start] what does this mean? can someone explain this for noobs [end]
[start] I said "ooh I love this! So cheeky [end]
[start] He reads books you know it’s [end]
[start] Tom Scott you madman [end]
[start] Huh? [end]
[start] Scott is actually the one taking the picture [end]
[start] "And I had to copy-paste from Stack Overflow" [end]
[start] Did you glitch out of the bus [end]
[start] I'm annoyed that no youtubers that make cool projects seem to put them up on a public GitHub. Man I just wanna learn this stuff since my uni degree is hardly teaching me any fun stuff. [end]
[start] i aswear im starting to know this link from memeory [end]
[start] XcQ = link stays blue.  learn it. [end]
[start] Get jabatted [end]
[start] oooohhh yyeeeee TUDUDUDUTUTUTU [end]
[start] >about as graceful as a drunk elephant  Damn, might have to review my coding practice after that one [end]
[start] This needs to be on the front page [end]
[start] What language is that written in? It's so... Comprehendible! [end]
[start] This is real /r/angryupvote for being cheeky [end]
[start] Did he use that as an example because that video is always increasing in views, making it a good example for seeing if your API is pulling down new numbers? [end]
[start] I'm so accustomed now, I see dQw4, I know it's a Rickroll. [end]
[start] Doesn't work on YT veterans. We know this url param by heart. [end]
[start] Good [end]
[start] I have that YouTube video I'd memorized [end]
[start] That XcQ ending of the URL. Never click on those links. I've learned that by trial and error. Mostly error. [end]
[start] Is anyone else sick of seeing Tom Scott? [end]
[start] lol his comments [end]
[start] What a fucking legend! [end]
[start] Reminds me of this little nugget: [https://youtu.be/hABj\_mrP-no?t=2742](https://youtu.be/hABj_mrP-no?t=2742) [end]
[start] Or Bloomberg? There’s a gay boi [end]
[start] wait, I know you. [end]
[start] XcQ means they've Rick rolled you. [end]
[start] hi tom. hows it going. love your videos [end]
[start] What? i didn't saw the code.. where is it? [end]
[start] That is genius. [end]
[start] He had to put a different ID in the source initially to be filmed because he didn't know what the actual video's ID would be until after upload. [end]
[start] Didn’t need to paste the link, the only other video that ends with XcQ is a Notre Dame fire live stream. [end]
[start] r/madlads [end]
[start] You don't recognise the ID?  And he is truly a legend. [end]
[start] This  This is a good meme [end]
[start] I tried to create a script that alerts me when the title changes. Unfortunately Google's API platform is not very beginner friendly :( [end]
[start] XcQ, the link stays blue! [end]
[start] It would have been cool if it had been the video ID of the actual Tom Scott video. [end]
[start] My favourite version of him doing this was at the end of a video about the high pitched noise that CRTs make [end]
[start] dammit I recognize that combo [end]
[start] XcQ, nty. [end]
[start] I can confirm his message though. I'm a video game programmer, and in my entire career they've never brought the visitors through to look at what we do, they just pass by our offices and give a brief description of our job. [end]
[start] So I wasn't the only one Rick rolled trying out the ID. [end]
[start] There are 443 comments, so I must comment [end]
[start] It literally says boilerplate code provided by Google. So Google is doing it [end]
[start] Everytime I read "wicked long boi" lol [end]
[start] Same url in his honest vpn ad video. It's kind of his thing it seems [end]
[start] I'm not ashamed to say I did exactly this when I saw it in the video. I knew what it was but I like the song so I just listened to the whole thing and then continued watching Tom's video [end]
[start] I'm half-surprised that it wasn't a link to "Gold" by Spandau Ballet. Though, honestly, he and Matt have probably stopped trying to Spandau each other for a while now. [end]
[start] He's sneaky guy.I dont like him [end]
[start] Look at the comments on that video now. As soon as the hive mind shows up it just get flooded with  title: exact right about views  nobody:   not even a single soul:   not even a fart in the wind:   me: **visible confusion** 100 ROFL XD [end]
[start] this is why you memorize that specific id [end]
[start] Rick Ashley needs to change that video to something else to rick roll the rick rollers [end]
[start] Has anyone else randomly gotten algorithm swamped by his videos lately? [end]
[start] Lol I just saw this video on the front page of YouTube. [end]
[start] You have my respec, Tom. [end]
[start] He is one of the most interesting youtubers out there for sure! Love his channel and work! [end]
[start] Why, why in god's name should you ever program in notepad++ [end]
[start] reminds me of the [greatest rick roll of all time](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) [end]
[start] He done the same thing in [this other video of his](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) [end]
[start] He looks younold [end]
[TITLE] "What was the previous electrician thinking?" [TITLE]
[start] I am still maintaining code I wrote 17ish years ago.  I hate young me. [end]
[start] >This guy writes code like from the 70s!   >   >But C++ wasn't a thing back then.   >   >Exactly! [end]
[start] When my home inspector opened the breaker box, he spent 5 minutes raving about the obvious professionalism and care of the last electrician. I almost asked if he needed a moment alone with the wiring.     [end]
[start] The best is when someone loudly complains about how shit something is before it's pointed out they'd actually done it and forgotten about it. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] The difference is that electricians curse the previous guy, but software engineers curse themselves [end]
[start] I think this is just a human thing. Which really is good, because it means we're progressing. can you imagine going to work on \*insert your craft here\* and thinking well theres no work to be done here, that guy 20 years ago did this perfectly. [end]
[start] Only 5 minutes? [end]
[start] Doctor: What was the previous doctor thinking?  > breaks everything   > starts again  ------------------------ #put a loop in here later [end]
[start] *furiously performs Mechanicus Rite of Tech Bitching* [end]
[start] Bloody hairdressers too  Can you just cut my hair in peace? I'm sorry the person before you doesn't live up to your expectations ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ [end]
[start] My dad is an electrician. Often the stuff by the previous electrician violates regulations, so he has to redo everything or it could be blamed on him. German regulations on electrics are quite strict compared to other countries, so take that with a grain of salt. [end]
[start] 5 minutes?  Try 5 years.  If this code has just one line written by someone else, that fuckin code ain't mine. [end]
[start] Apprentice electrician here, absolutely! [end]
[start] also as an electrician you have to complain about the guys who installed the radiator system for their shitty pipe placement, the construction workers for not being able to build a straight wall that doesn‘t collapse when you‘re cutting in the wiring canald and also the customer for having completely unrealistic idea about the magic things the electrician is performing.  *coming from an electrician* replace with for any other workers for different professions  [end]
[start] Sometimes you have to sigh and remember that maybe the first thing you see is the last thing they did, at 5:30 on a Friday. [end]
[start] I try not to talk shit until after I’ve fixed the problem. Then it’s all fair game.  [end]
[start] [Relevant Dilbert](https://dilbert.com/strip/2018-11-13) [end]
[start] Half of an electricians job is talking shit about other people's work.   Source: am electrician.  [end]
[start] As an electrician. I have to agree with this. [end]
[start] Former software engineer : current electrician... I look at the electrical prints and complain about the CAD work. [end]
[start] AKA "Not invented here syndrome" [end]
[start] I'm an aircraft technician and we do the same thing.   "The fuck was the last shift thinking?" [end]
[start] Congratulations. You played yourself. *Dj Khaled walks away [end]
[start] I dont appreciate  this [end]
[start] I just did this, just took over some code and bitched about how terrible it was for the first couple days before actually getting anything done. [end]
[start] Electrician here.     Yes, it's part of the job. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Ah shit, story time. In mobile so this might look terrible.  Back when I was in the Navy we were getting ready for an underway replenishment. There's this huge contraption that raises up and down to send stuff across from one ship to another on lines (can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/eRay8ysTg44). For some reason this thing isn't working, and we have to get it ready by tomorrow.  We open up this panel and it's all screwed under. Wires going every which way, nothing labeled, we had no idea what we were looking at. Pretty much the whole Electrical Division was working on it all through the night. We spent about 10 hours tracing everything labeling it all, and figuring out what went where. We barely get it done in time, and the rep goes just fine.  Come to find out at quarters the next morning (after the customary 2 hours of sleep), a fellow shipmate had rewired the whole thing a while back. He was on watch or sleeping most of the day before, so wasn't involved in the troubleshooting. This dude had a whole diagram with everything labeled in his rack, and never thought to pull it out the entire time. We gave him so much shit for the rest of the deployment.  Pretty much any older Navy ship will have a shit ton of unlabeled wires, random dead ends that are still live, etc.  [end]
[start] "What Fucking Idiot thought this was a good Idea?"  \*Checks ChangeLog\*  It was me. [end]
[start] I complain even if I was the previous programmer.  [end]
[start] In my 20s, I was an electrician.  As time went by, I grew to had my old work from when I was an apprentice.  Fast forward 10 years, I became a software engineer.  I just opened up an application I wrote 2 years ago and I hate it.  It’s not trade-specific, it’s universal. [end]
[start] My first job was as a .NET engineer maintaining these gross multi-thousand line VB files that were written by my boss back when it was just him and another dude. So not only did I have to work with garbage code I couldn't openly complain about how bad it was [end]
[start] I got a programmer job a month ago (I'm physicist who decided to go into IT) and I am already wondering what was the guy who worked before me thinking.  There was some feature request from client and he told that some field in database could take only two values (so a bit type field). At first I took it for granted and continued his work with that thing in mind. It was very inconvient to me, so I decided to take a look and see how hard would it be to change database and everything related so this field would take more values. Imagine my surprise when I saw that this field was of tinyint type. [end]
[start] It’s a ritual for anyone who has someone that does their job another way than what they are used to.  [end]
[start] "What was *I* thinking"   People on this sub could write a 799 part War And Peace length book series about it. Full with Movies, a Netflix Show, FanFiction and Hentai   [end]
[start] Complaining about previous work being done is universal across all professionals. My wife is a stylist    Oh so you went to a different stylist last time? Quiet muttering "No wonder your hair is f'd up". ...Next time just come to me if you want it done how you prefer.  I'm a window cleaner and I see the ladder marks, the unclean caulkes edges, and bleeders! Who cleaned this stinking window? Ray Charles with a hammer?! [end]
[start] "Who wrote this component, it's completely unmaintainable!"  \- me, almost always about code written by past me [end]
[start] Am electrician, rules allow for 5mins to entire job for complaining, depends on this algorithm:  Amount of coffee consumed / amount of energy to be expended for repair (x) years of electrical service experience (+) amount of apprentice electricians in the nearby vicinity.    [end]
[start] Working in water utilities, I wonder this almost daily in both positive and negative aspects. [end]
[start] Assigning blame to someone else before you've even made the mistake, that's just smart. [end]
[start] I was complaining to my CIO about how a piece of old legacy code was written, because it was the most awkwardly written crap even for 10 years ago (instead of writing an array of column headers, it was a string of column headers separated by line terminators, and then exploded on the line terminators and then a for loop that iterated over that array by reference to strip out whitespace, instead of just writing an array of column headers).   He pointed out it was a script he had written. [end]
[start] It’s in the NEC in article 90, union and nonunion are both required by the AHJ to do this.  [end]
[start] As an electrician I can confirm this is a ritual  [end]
[start] They also have to perform the Electrician’s Expression of Disgust, which involves arching your eyebrows and puffing your cheeks as you exhale a sigh of relief that the house hasn’t yet burst into flame. [end]
[start] As an part time electrician. The answer is yes  [end]
[start] Hey, I was a software engineer that became an electrician.  Do I get 10 minutes? [end]
[start] As an electrician I can confirm that this is a thing. We will also praise the previous electrician if they did good work usually... I have pictures on my phone of other electricians work because I’ve been that impressed with it lol. [end]
[start] git blame....  Oops, NVM, it was the two week younger me.  [end]
[start] As an electrician this is taught to us in school and is mandatory.  [end]
[start] I'm on a 3 year contract, I mercilessly mock the guy before me's code and one day the guy after me will mercilessly mock my code. The cycle of life and death continues [end]
[start] It took me an hour, and I burst out in the middle of class laughing. [end]
[start] I had an electrician come in and say the same thing before he realized he did it for the previous home owner. To his credit he didn’t charge me to fix it once he realized it was his fuck up. [end]
[start] "Why the fuck would they do X?..."  One quick look at git blame/log...  Shit, why the fuck did I do X?... [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Some not so subtle r/humblebrag bs right there. With a side of r/gatekeeping [end]
[start] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7erl9k01C2M [end]
[start] I'm a former electrician and now a software engineer. Should I hate everything? 🤔 [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked... by future me when I try to fix or modify this code I'm writing today, a year from now. [end]
[start] I am an electrician. The answer is yes.  [end]
[start] What was the previous electritian thinking sending Walcott on that early? [end]
[start] He must be in the wrong guild if he thinks 5 minute is enough to finish complaining  [end]
[start] My dad worked for the IBEW for almost forty years, and I'm a developer now; we both just got a good kick out of this. [end]
[start] Hindsight is 20/20 [end]
[start] Out of the way software, hardware coming through. [end]
[start] I do work in crawlspaces under people's houses and uh... I'm surprised more houses haven't burnt down. I've seen some wiiiiiiiiiiild electrical work. [end]
[start] There are many different ways of writing something down/putting something together when it comes to Electrical engineering so 1st u need to figure out whats already done and how is it written [end]
[start] I didn’t even realize I did this till now. I always look at people panels and smh [end]
[start] Not just Electricians, plumbers and carpenters as well. I had an entire heat/AC and back up generator put it. They kept doing some strange shit I would call them on since I was a finish carpenter and put in my own electrical and plumbing. But the hvac I no longer can do. So the vent put into the bathroom was so crooked I said something and the guy I spoke to blamed it all on his partner. Guess what I watched him cut the damn hole and called him out on it. I must have been mistaken he says so I called his partner up from the basement and then lit a match to see what happened next. Stupidity happened and they began to argue then fist fight, then I fired them... [end]
[start] My father is an electrician. I can attest to this ritual. [end]
[start] I work in AV/IT. Any time I’m fixing somebody else’s shit I do the same thing. And I’m sure the next guy says it about me. A lot of the time it’s not wrong, it just feels wrong. Or it is wrong but they were under time constraint and had to rig some shit last second.  [end]
[start] And then you realise it's your own code. [end]
[start] At least we have annotations so we can point out the asshole that did it.  Oh, it's me. [end]
[start] Pot, meet kettle. Have a conversation. [end]
[start] a prompt throat punch from the electrician probably would have followed the insult.  [end]
[start] Haha good one i know about electrician work [end]
[start] Yes that is our main rule. EVERY other electrician is an idiot besides yourself. And it’s 10 minutes of complaining thank you.  [end]
[start] Im pretty sure they use that line to act like they are doing more work than they actually are. [end]
[start] This is just a part of working a trade in general. Shitting on shoddy work and praising good work. [end]
[start] Yeah, but they're paid by the hour... [end]
[start] Anyone have the twitter link? [end]
[start] As an electrician, it damn well is written in our blood rites.  [end]
[start] https://i.imgur.com/eoQSvu2.png [end]
[start] My colleagues are all substantially older and most of them wrote C++ most of their careers and then switched to Java so at least I have that to delude myself into thinking I'm always correct [end]
[start] It does take one to know one [end]
[start] can confirm, we have to do this. but we also really really want to [end]
[start] I don't think I've ever come across a repair man, electrician, plumber, etc. who ever had anything nice to say about my house or appliances.  "Yeeeaaahh. This model dryer is a piece of crap."  "What would you recommend for the next one I buy?"  "...nothing. Clothesline, maybe?"   [end]
[start] Weird flex but ok [end]
[start] I'm an electrician.. this is incredibly true because the truth is everyone does their own style of things and electrical can he a total fucking mess but it will still work  [end]
[start] Also every  Comcast technician . [end]
[start] The real question: is it an electricians rule to actually get stuff done as opposed to just complaining about how bad the last electrician did his job? [end]

[start] The best one is when you adamantly try and avoid a code review because you have no fucking idea how the feature and it's surrounding areas work. Only for someone to track down your commits and how you wrote most of it and stitch you up in front of the rest of the team 🤦‍♂️ [end]

[start] The worst depressing thing is after you really understand the old terrible code base, you suddenly also understand why it is so terrible and now you have to take all of your complaining back because you realize that you would have done the same thing in those circumstances.  [end]

[start] Am electrician. Can confirm. All past electricians are idiots that didn't know what the hell they were doing, and existed only to fuck up the one thing I'm presently trying to do.  &#x200B; [end]
[start] No, because electricians actually have professional licensure and building codes to follow. [end]
[start] As someone who works in IT production, I expect everyone to complain about my shit and I expect to complain about theirs.  I love everyone but fuck the world. [end]
[start] Yeeeaah... The ritual is ongoing. [end]
[start] Unless you’re writing life/safety critical code, can’t really compare the two.   [end]
[start] On the electrician side, I just took a NEC class. Lots of funny stories from the instructor.  [end]
[start] Let he who lives in a glass house throw the first stone. [end]
[start] This is also true of carpenters/construction workers, from my experience. [end]
[start] As an ex-electrician who now codes, I can tell you we blame plumbers more than anything else.  Fucking easy money pipe jockeys.  [end]
[start] It's OK you can still blame the electrician [end]
[start] Isn’t that because American standards and laws regarding electrical installs and licensing is utter horse shit?  [end]

[start] This is not a Game. The Game [end]
[start] Honest question from a technical person but total programming noob compared to actual comp sci professionals:  How to deal with password reuse? I have a few “good” passwords in my head, and I divide them into classes of security (bank stuff is one class, primary email and Dropbox another, those two are highest priority. Then there’s another class for the rest that kinda doesn’t matter). I generally avoid using passwords across classes, but that’s the extend of my safeguards.   What’s the right way to do it? Password managers? But that seems like a bottleneck of some sort... all eggs in one basket and so on, and I’ve always been distrustful of those things without knowing much about them to be honest.  Thoughts? [end]
[start] I have no idea in encryption and security. Can you encrypt twice or more using different techniques stack on each other for more security? [end]
[start] Fools, they should have had AI develop their security model with machine learning, then put it on a private blockchain so users can use Facebook login credentials to log in.   All this could have been theirs for the low price of twice their net worth, but don't worry that will quadruple their stock price overnight. [end]
[start] It still probably has better security than most apps. [end]

[TITLE] Thank you guys, you are the real heroes [TITLE]
[start] You forgot the arrow that says "Question marked as duplicate"  Edit: seems I've triggered flashbacks for a lot of people.. [end]
[start] the hero that everyone on stackoverflow needs but stackoverflow doesnt deserve [end]
[start] "How do I do this on Windows?"  "Use Linux"  Thanks bro. [end]
[start] Makes me think about the guy who closed my question as duplicate and linked it to another question. Question were not similar nor were the answers. Another helped me and I understood why it was linked : in the two question’s answer they used a link to regex tutorial completely useless for my case ! [end]
[start] Once I was stuck in a little for-fun project, lucky for me it was an Arduino related problem and I posted it on the Arduino forum.   Their community was a blast! I received like 10 comments on my post and every single one was a helpful insight, one guy replied not only with a solution but even with a detailed idea he thought I could find interesting.   10/10 would post there again 4/10 Stack should really improve as a community [end]
[start] I aspire to be that person [end]
[start] What irks me the most is people answering "That's wrong, in 99% of cases you don't want to do that. Do that instead.".  Dammit, either the person asking is already a master and is the 1%, or they are a beginner and you could answer their question and tell them WHY it's usually a bad idea before offering alternative solutions. [end]
[start] I never understood why people bother to waste time and reply and not answer the question like who’s the fool now [end]
[start] -1 for not having 20+ years of experience.  StackOverflow is r/roastme but for programmers. [end]
[start] My first post be like dat but the hero was missing :') [end]
[start] Those who explain exactly what the snippet does are the true hero. Especially if you don't speak the language. [end]
[start] Tried to be that guy for some redditor the other day and they deleted their thread 5 minutes after i had taken the time to replicate their code, fix it, and make a post explaining what they were doing wrong.  Not amused. [end]
[start] You should try using jQuery for that [end]
[start] Pretty much every time I use stack overflow I get the same thing:    “You did it wrong. Do it this way instead. (insert way too complicated solution here; I’m just a programmer for fun, damn it)”    Once I asked if I could have a simpler solution or one that didn’t completely wreck my code. The guy said something along the lines of     “No, you want a *lazy* solution, because you are too lazy to do it correctly.”    Man, I am never using that site again. [end]
[start] Had some basic stuff to do in C a few days ago, and since I didn‘t code in that language since about a year, and have very limited experience in it, I needed to google some basic errors. Since VS+Bing (yeah I hate it already) directed me to some german stackoverflow-like sites, I decided to check them out.   Most toxic shit I‘ve ever seen. Question was simple, OP provided code, libraries and error messages, but another guy (a moderator, no less)  basically insulted him for a free paragraphs, then demanded more information, otherwise he would just straight up delete the question. Another guy joins in, also ripping the guy and his beginner code apart, until another one comes and finally shows him his answer: He missed a function declaration. [end]
[start] "Its already been answered here"  If it answered my question I wouldn't have posted the question in the first place. [end]
[start] Work in Building Automation for the government. Make 6 figures.   There was a Philippino dude when I worked at the private sector that held my hand from 2008 to 2011, would not be where I am today without him doing shit like this.   He was just interested how shit worked and was fired up to talk about it, made his day to help me out. [end]
[start] the correct response:  1. Answer the question asked, ignoring all possible "better" solutions.  2. Explain that this solution isn't optimal because of X and Y. Maybe look into (link to related topic)  3. Provide your personal opinion as a closing statement, if you want. Emphasis on statement, singular. [end]
[start] This is template #114 from r/SrGrafo in case anyone's wondering [end]
[start] I always hate the "You should stop using that framework" or "You should use this framework instead" because my job is maintaining the software I currently have, I am not in a technical lead position to make such a vast design decision like implementing a new framework, or removing an existing one... so the best I can do is shrug off/downvote that answer, and move on.  &#x200B;  Like okay I guess I'll go up to my tech lead and tell him we should stop using this framework, and after he tells me no I'm still stuck in the same situation I was 5 minutes earlier. [end]
[start] Except he’ll be downvoted or deleted by the power hungry mods and then you’ll see your question marked duplicate or vague.  And you’ll see a list of like 7 mods all ganging up.    Even though I use it often there’s no alternative.  ExpertSexChange became so commercial it’s awful.  Though early 2000s it was useful. [end]
[start] These people are the ones that actually helped me learn how to articulate my questions better and gave me the confidence to improve my programming skills. I owe it to a lot of selfless individuals who responded to my horribly formatted freshman year of college questions. [end]
[start] Work in support. Most programmers are the kindest people, but you get the odd 1 or 2 who think they're god.  When I ask "What does this (code) do?", and I get the reply of "Read the documentation."   I will immediately go back to them with "Well let me know when you've written it, but for the time being, answer the question." [end]
[start] you should really read the documentation tho [end]
[start] Stackoverflow is just a dick measuring contest, everyone just posts answers to show everyone else how smart they are rather than care about actually helping the person.  The easiest way to get a straight answer from these losers is to ask a question and post the wrong solution and state that its the best way and you'll have these wizards come out of the woods and show you the right way while calling you a moron. [end]
[start] This is such a huge pet peeves of mine. If someone asks a question either be helpful or leave. There's no require to comment. [end]
[start] Not to be “that guy”, but there seems to be this misconception that StackOverflow is a place for people to ask questions.  StackOverflow’s “goal” is to build a comprehensive Wikipedia-like structure for frequently asked questions, or specific questions about quirky behavior that revolve around “why does X work but Y doesn’t” and “how does one use Z”.  if 2 people are asking the same question, we don’t want to divide the answers between two pages.  A majority of questions are like “I wrote all this code and it doesn’t work, someone please fix it for me”.  Fixing one persons code only helps one person, and if the question isn’t well formed then someone later on with the same problem won’t find the page because the question was just like “fix my code” which is not search friendly.  Posting a question on StackOverflow, much like editing Wikipedia, is subject to harsh criticism and reversion/removal by the people who are on the site all day every day trying to maintain order so that even 4-5 years after being asked, people can still find a question and see its answer.  edit: FYI my stack overflow account was banned 7 years ago for "asking bad questions", I've already gone through the rage cycle, i'm not one of those snobby contributors that's always shitting on people, just sharing observations on what I've seen from being on the site on a daily basis looking up answers for the last 7 years ;) [end]
[start] r/wholesomeprogrammers [end]
[start] I just hate when people close something because it's too opinion based. Like no shit most software has opinions on the right way to do thing. I asked because I want to hear the different options. [end]
[start] My personal favorite is "You should never be doing this anyways!" Yeah I'll tell the guy that retired 3 years ago and left me with this code... [end]
[start] I have posted a lot of questions and received a lot of answers on stackoverflow, and only had this experience once or twice. So I'm gonna play devil's advocate, and suggest that maybe all the people who upvoted this meme, and are commenting that they had the same experience, should try to practice asking their questions clearly. And i do mean that honestly, because i've had situations where i re-read my questions after a long time, and they made so little sense that i barely knew what i meant myself. Which is because i was in a different state of mind when asking it, and i was caught up in the frustration of the problem that i was having. So having your question misunderstood is, excuse the pun, understandable. [end]
[start] Missed the “duplicate question”. [end]
[start] **Edit:** original comment was about the following questoin:   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452671/disable-all-gcc-warnings  u/jsims281 pointed out that this question was edited which I didn't notice and basically invalidates my comment. [end]
[start] I've reached the point in which my questions are just not answered because too niche or not "newbie" anyway so the self absorbed morons can't really find a way to write any of the above... still ends up with no answers or, at best: it's shitty by design (actual answer from a google support guy on there) [end]
[start] I've never really had a bad experience with StackOverflow but yeah making sure your question is clear AND concise is really important [end]
[start] People who actually explain it instead of just posting a snippet are the *real* heroes [end]
[start] I’ve always included as much information in my question posts to let the potential person who would be answering me be able to recreate the scenario for themselves. I find the more information you give, the more likely you’ll get a good response. I’ve asked a fair few questions and none of them have ever been marked as duplicate or gotten shitty answers. [end]
[start] You forgot the all time classic "Why do want to do that?" *My reasons are my reasons dammit!* [end]
[start] God forbid you read the documentation [end]
[start] "How do I do this in vanilla JS? I can't use jQuery"     95% of answers use jQuery. Every time. [end]
[start] Speaking as a top 2% SO contributor. The problem is folks. misinterpret the purpose of the site.   It's not there to help you  It is there to help everyone   The distinction is subtle. Back in the yesteryear there were forums where everyone tried to help everyone. Sometimes people got their questions answered(but usually not). The conversation was all Willy nilly. The next person that said "gee that sounds like my problem" would have no idea if the answer was buried someplace in th 50 "have you tried this... How bout this?" Replies. Sometimes after their problem was solved OP would just stop responding (classic denver coder syndrome). You probably have tried to use one of these sites at some point and gave up because four pages into the conversation you weren't even sure if they were talking about  your problem any more.  Stack overflow's mission is to build a library of quality questions and answers. This means that they may not be interested in helping you personally. It's not there to help students or people struggling at a new job. It is there to create a useful FAQ for future generations on as many programming topics as possible.  Think about this for a second. When a new version of React comes out and it has a bug. You can type the exact error into Google and  immediately get a satisfactory explanation from a question and correct answer on SO. That's the power of 500 closed questions.  Remember that when some one closes your question it's not personal. That's in your head because you are struggling. When they critique your question they are trying to help you ask better questions. And boy do they know a lot about questions and answers(there is a whole system I've closed thousands) If you learn how to use the site it's can change the way you approach problem solving. [end]
[start] I actively don't ask questions on stack overflow because of this. [end]
[start] Question: So I feel like making a cake, what jam should I put in it?  Answers:  1. OMG people in 2020 are still making cakes? Don't you know it's bad for your health? You should switch to a vegan diet, or better eat only raw vegetables, no only apples, no screw eating altogether, breathing is enough to survive!  2. Just wanted to point out that if you plan on using oranges, the actual term is "marmalade", not "jam".  3. Do you really think that this is going to be your main problem? Do even have flour, water, sugar, butter and all the remaining ingredients?  4. LOL noob everyone knows that cherry jam is the best. Like why are you even asking. Have you ever baked a cake before?  Comment to 4: R U serious M8? Cherry jam? Plum is a thousand times better in terms of taste AND for your health!  Author of 1 replying to said comment: none of them are healthy. Cakes are bad for your health full stop. [end]
[start] Answered on _unrelated question_ [end]
[start] And the question is closed anyway even if it has an answer from this person. [end]
[start] "Just try searching Google?"  Top result on Google. [end]
[start] "but why would you want to do that?"   "just use Boost my dude"   "use jQuery, idc if it's 2020" [end]
[start] I totally agree with this.  People ask stupid questions on there like "How do I change my text to green" and get thousands of upvotes and kind responses.    I once had a very complex problem and asked for some help and the hate and downvotes I got was unbelievable. Some responses I got:  "You're trying to get someone to do your work for you" "Figure it out yourself" "lazy"  In fact I stopped using stackoverflow because of this.  Such bullshit. [end]
[start] Most questions have already been answered on SO, especially if you’re a beginner. I haven’t had to ask a question in years, there’s so much info on that site. It’s a much nicer site to use as a compendium of knowledge rather than a Q&A forum. [end]
[start] I have never seen this attitude on stack overflow.  Granted I always make sure my questions are well researched and I’ve done more than just a cursory google search before asking.  I also answer questions and curate new questions, and most people are generally quite helpful.  Unless you are asking truly banal questions, most people go out of their way to help.  Stack overflow should be used as a “last resort”, meaning you’ve exhausted all your options of research and questioning.  There are a lot of questions that are just: “solve problem X for me” and then they post some poorly written code.  Those ARE bad questions and you should feel bad if you do this.  It is a waste of people’s time.  There are other places to request coding help.  Stack overflow is meant to crowdsource knowledge, not your job duties/homework. [end]
[start] what about “this question has been marked as duplicate” to a post that’s not even remotely the same [end]
[start] I had a problem with my code and searched it up, and StackOverflow came up. The person had written the code like me, so I assume they were in college or at an education level also, and asked where he went wrong. Everyone ripped him apart for the way he coded, something like “this is horrifically outdated,” or whatever. Then, to top it all off, the “best answer” was a link to the documentation. I don’t think I will ever post on that site myself if everyone’s just going to boost their ego rather than try to help a beginner out. [end]
[start] Its funny how these things evolve (or devolve I guess). In the early days of SO it was a very convivial community of folks eager to help one another. Now anytime I goto ask a question I wind up deleting it before posting about 75% of the time because I just know I'm going to get hit with a slew of replies telling me why my question is stupid and that I'm doing it all wrong, and why am I doing it that way? Or people who love to answer questions you never asked, love those asshole too.   Shit man, sometimes you inherit a shitty project and have to make do, sometimes the client forces you to use a 3rd party service that is horribly designed, you can't do anything about it, you just have to make the best of a bad situation [end]
[start] I used to just give a code snippet in my answers but someone downvoted me and told me to explain them properly. Now I try to include in-depth explanations especially if they seem like a beginner, but it’s annoying when my answers doesn’t get accepted or upvoted after all that work I put in. Or maybe that’s just because I mainly answer questions from people new to the site and don’t know how things work. [end]
[start] This happened to me.  I had done something wrong in my design but found a way to make it work. Was totally against proper design principles for the language because in this situation it's never supposed to work. But it worked. So I asked StackOverfow how it worked.  Mother fuckers couldn't see past the design dogma.  Then this guy decompiled it and showed the language was violating it's own design principles. [end]
[start] That's why whenever I answer questions, I will just answer it. Even if I think the OP is doing something very silly or not recommended, I'll still answer it because that's what _I_ would have wanted and that's how people learn. If I gave you the answer that works perfectly you won't know why your code isn't working when it _doesnt_.  Put away your ego for 5 minutes and just answer the question as written [end]
[start] I try to help, but so many questions like “Code not go. how I make machine learning work?” [end]
[start] Exactly the feeling when I post a question. Sometimes I think it's better to post it in a relevant sub in Reddit than facing the criticism of the Stackoverflow community. [end]
[start] One thing I don’t like is people providing the snippet of code and not explaining how it works or even adding comments. Usually I can figure it out myself unless there’s some weird addition to the code (like before I knew how to use lambdas in Java). [end]
[start] I literally gave up programming because of stack overflow.    I mean there were other reasons, and I found a new field of study who I think it's more for me but stack overflow was just a constant reminder of how much programming wasn't my field and how fucking toxic some people can get for no reason at all [end]
[start] to be fair, some of the questions shouldnt be asked in the first place. You should try to find the solution for a while, before you ask the question. Imagine everything on the site to be useful, not just quick; "how do output to console " or "what is a vector" questions, stuff you actually have to figure out yourself at some point [end]
[start] ITT: Idiots who suck at asking questions or expect the internet to solve their homework for them. [end]

[start] This can be applied to every medium, never shame someone for trying to learn. [end]
[start] Stack Overflow got me through some pretty tough days back in College. I wish I could personally thank those that actually gave me code snippets, AND answered questions I had after [end]
[start] You forgot "here's a solution for something that's hardly related to your question" [end]
[start] I do not get how did the Blue man protect the small guy from RTFM and other recommendations? The max he did was healing the question guy from the arrow wounds with his actually useful answer.   It should be a two panel comic, with arrows on the first panel and the blue man as a doctor on the second. [end]

[start] That's usually the guy with bad practices. It's the blind leading the blind sometimes. [end]
[start] At least in your job you got an active community with tons of advice. [end]
[start] Stack overflow programmers saviour 😄👍 [end]
[start] Heck, I work in IT and run our in house support desk. I know what information is useful and what isn't when asking technical questions.   Even then, when I'm posting of stack overflow or server fault, I worry that I'm going to just get torn into for asking a question that was answered 6 years ago.  It's as if the people that have knowledge on the topics seem to have forgotten that technology has vastly changed even in the past 2 years and even if the exact same question was asked 6 years back, the answer will likely be completely different.  I also hate the fact that stack overflow is continuing the stereotype of IT pros being arrogant, circle jerking pricks. If you dont enjoy helping people in a polite manner, then don't. That type of attitude is unnecessary. [end]
[start] My favorite ones are when the person who asked the question comments "Ah, ok I found the problem. Thank you all who helped." And not stating the solution.   It's cool when you get help but not when you give help. Toxic platform... i get more of my questions answered from github than stackoverflow. [end]
[start] Ive never understood why so many people on stack overflow seem to have such a god complex or are just straight up not nice people. When i was new to coding unless someone else had had the same issue as me and i could learn by lurking stackoverflow was useless. It wasnt until i git better and knew shit that i could even get a single positive response from folks on there.   Once i spent about a month on that site just going around helping the obviously beginner coders with simple css problems because everyone else just seemed to downvoted and ridicule them. It basically destroyed my account because those same people would also downvoted the shit out of my answers because how dare i help these coder peasants lol  Stackoverflow is 90% toxic 9% lurkers and 1% people who actually give a shit about helping. Only reason at this point its still a fairly useful tool is because of the sheer amount of content on it. [end]
[start] I hope everyone complaining here helps answer questions... [end]
[start] And that's the guy with a greyed out vote with a -4 rating, and it actually solves your issue. [end]
[start] The only reason I'm on stack overflow is because the documentation is bad and I'm past the point of having fun. [end]
[start] I think they just don’t know and say what they do know about the topic [end]
[start] My ignorance is often mistaken for hostility.... [end]
[start] You forgot the helpful guy linking to a forums post with the answer that is either deleted or gives a 404. [end]
[start] Accidental debate [end]
[start] If the site is that hostile to people who post questions there, why use it? [end]
[start] Thank you this is the way I came [end]
[start] Usually neither the one asking the question reads the answers. One time I got downvoted because my answer was correct but the op copy-pasted the snipped without reading how to use it   Later said "wow I got it wrong now it's working" under my answer but kept it downvoted and never accept my asset as correct... [end]
[start] This wouldn't exist if we'd all be kind and gentle towards each other - we've all been there. It's, literally, that simple. [end]
[start] However is better to be given the tools to face an problem over a specific solution for every problem you've encountered so far. Only learning to browse through documentation and understanding error messages and the like gets you ahead in learning programming (among other things like studying the more you can etc.). A beginner may not see it, but is the ability to face the unknown and find solutions that make you deliver on time or are innovative enough to make money that are worth the effort. And for both this things someone that tells you the solution to your problem doesn't exist. So better be prepared. This joke about stack overflow is silly for anyone who's a professional in the field [end]
[start] Take a fricken wholesome.... This is perfect. [end]
[start] "That question was answered like 10 years ago on some other forum, did you even search first?" [end]
[start] And then there's the litany of  "Why doesn't my program work? I have 3 boxes and one box works. Help please?" [end]
[start] I never post on stackoverflow. If I don’t find someone else who asked the same question, I just give up and wallow in sorrow. [end]
[start] Omg, everybody experience that? Until now I thought I was the only one! [end]
[start] You forgot the required "Why are you doing that?"  (and its cousin, "Why do you want to do that?") [end]
[start] I have no clue about programming but i mean this applies to so many forums. [end]
[start] Could I please have the original image? [end]
[start] My comp sci teacher always says those sights are filled with people who want to look smart rather than actually help.  It's painfully true. [end]
[start] Is there any other site like stackoverflow but with less assholes? [end]
[start] Marked as duplicate.  Links to a 10+ year old, outdated solution [end]
[start] "Google it" But that's how I got here! [end]
[start] Did you read the documentation tho.. [end]
[start] The Stack Overflow Police are sensitive cunts who need a hug. [end]
[start] Similar environment in some r/networking threads. [end]
[start] When answer says Google your question or duplicate question, but the post was the first result on Google search [end]
[start] Don't know why but Stackoverflow users are rude as compared to other stackexchange sites [end]
[start] As someone who's about to jump back into studying CS after a several year break and having to basically catch up on the new materials, these folk are definitely the real fucking heroes. [end]
[start] To be fair there are a LOT of shit questions. Many of which are "please fix this code for me" with nothing else. [end]
[start] Hey "that one guy" if you're reading this... Thank you so much man! Your suggestion did work for me in the best way of all! [end]
[start] Those who call questions stupid are dipshits. [end]
[start] Fucking every single time. It's almost like they can't bear feeling like they don't know the correct answer to your question so they'd rather spew unrelated, innacurate and absolutely pointless bullshit until you give up, just so they can feel an ounce of self-importance.  Also, this question's a duplicate, see : Unrelated garbage. [end]
[start] Everybody who hates on Stack Overflow should spend at least an hour trying to answer questions.  You'll immediately notice what the general problem is and why people behave the way they do. [end]
[start] "This question has been answered before, try using the search function."   Definitely the most common answer I get while searching answers for my questions. [end]
[start] Am I the only one who enjoys SO.. ? When I got down votes or "marked as a duplicate" on  questions, it was usually for good reasons. SO is designed to make you think before you post, to put the best efforts in your posts. Yes, it's hard. But aren't most of the things worth something hard? [end]
[start] I really don't get the hate for stackoverflow. You'd be surprised how many questions that don't deserve to be answered actually get the answer for ranking points. [end]
[start] I asked something once on stack overflow and I got bombarded for everything while I was just starting out. Had 7h experience in node.js and everyone was just hating every character in my code. Since then I decided that if I need help, I'm not asking it unless it is a friend that can help me.  Edit: I like to program but my code will always be sloppy cuz I want it my way. That's how I learned it in autohotkey and I made some fun programs in that and now I'm using both on a regular basis for fun.  Funfact: currently it is easier for me to write bots and whatever in autohotkey than in node.js [end]
[start] I got banned from asking questions because of this [end]
[start] I hate stack overflow.  Every time I go on there to look something up half the people look like they seriously only there to copy paste the question into a search so they can demand it be closed. [end]
[start] Speaking as a top 0.5% you're full of shit. SoF _IS_ there to help _you_. whether you're a student or a guy looking for a job or whatever. That's why I answer any question I can regardless of whether it's a duplicate or if OP is trying something not recommended. [end]
[start] IF YOUR NOT GOING TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE DON'T RESPOND TO QUESTIONS [end]
[start] Wish there was an alternative to that site.  You'll ask a question and some person with a massive chip on their shoulder will chastise you for not going with an outdated answer from 10 years ago.  Plus they now state that asking questions is a privilege that's taken away if no one answers your question effectively banning you from the site. [end]

[start] Unrealistic that there's a "You should stop using that framework" but no "Use JQuery"  To read StackOverflow, one would think that JQuery itself was written in Wonderscript (fabled language of the gods), since it is widely held to be impossible to do what JQuery does using javascript alone. [end]
[start] Remember guys, this is reddit.com not Stackoverflow.com [end]
[start] the read the documentation thing tilts me every time. like yeah, I guess it's somewhere in the 1000 pages of texts, but can you just tell me what to do so I can work on my real thing which the script I'm trying to write is just a tiny part of? [end]

[start] The worst thing about programmer jokes I read on this subreddit is that no one near me understands them.   The best thing about programmer jokes I read on this subreddit is that no one near me understands them. [end]
[start] The LITERAL definition of "cloning" is by value.  Otherwise it would be called referencing. [end]
[start] git clone always copies by value [end]
[start] A clone by reference is new body with same soul while clone by value is with different soul.  Edit: We need a God-like power in order to unit test this. [end]
[start] Brilliant. When you clone by reference you create an avatar. [end]
[start] That brings me back to a discussion I had once after too many beers. If you are teleported there are two ways, actually transporting the matter to the other point and destroying in one place and remaking it in another. In that case are you the same person with the latter option? The cells are different, you are technically a clone in another place. [end]

[start] I normally understand cloning as copying by value even in programming context, and in real world copying by reference is like copying something by having two people look at it at same time.  Though it might be philosophically more interesting that what I would have asked as clarification in this case, "Do we compare by reference or value?", as that boils down to same question of whatever equal is same. [end]
[start] Cloning humans by ref would be great for synchronized swimming [end]
[start] If you change all the variables of an instance, is it still the same instance? [end]
[start] Technically by value is a fork not a clone [end]
[start] The person becomes a parent [end]
[start] These are the jokes that made me subscribe to this subreddit.  But sadly we get only one of these for every 0x3E6 "Programmers are googlers" or "Spaghetti Code" joke... [end]
[start] Lol. Imagine writing my name somewhere and claiming I've been cloned. [end]
[start] Clone by reference: mirror  Clone by value: asexual reproduction [end]
[start] It's a really vague and kind of shitty question. In what way do they mean are they the same person? Do they share the same soul? That goes a bit beyond the scope of what we can know. Should they be considered the same legal entity? Then, no. A clone is functionally just an identical twin that got delayed, and you wouldn't consider twins the same person. If the question is how a clone should be treated under the law, then they should be treated as the biological offspring of the original. [end]
[start] Depends on definition of “the same” [end]
[start] Well, depends on the language. I’d have to bust out my old C book for pointers.... [end]
[start] Chris O'Neil has a lot to say on the topic. [end]
[start] You can't clone by reference.  If you clone an object, you're always getting another copy of that object.  Might be a shallow copy, but it's always a copy, not the same object, and if you alter one, you do not automatically change the other.  Otherwise it's not cloning; it's just passing a reference. [end]
[start] I'm not a programmer can someone explain [end]
[start] A clone is definitely a different person. So having sex with your clone is definitely not masturbation but gay sex. [end]
[start] Cloning by reference would require both clone and original to exist in same spatial position, thus superposing each other. This would only work in parallel identical dimensions. [end]
[start] Depend if A+=1 or A=A+1 [end]
[start] Inheritance be like: [end]
[start] If by ref, how are you comparing the objects? [end]
[start] Git or Javascript? [end]
[start] It's really more of a question of whether you *compare* references or values for equality. It's implied that a clone is copied by value (although not necessarily a deep copy). [end]
[start] You just save a local copy of the online repository. You can send a pull request to the actual person though. [end]
[start] So cloning by reference means the clone shares the same memory (address) . If cloning by reference means they are the same person, and cloning by value means they are not, does that imply memories define individuals? [end]
[start] I love this😂 what could be classified as a reference in case of a human being? What is the value?... Nietzsche, bless philosophy [end]
[start] "If you clone someone and kill the original, is that murder?"  'Oh nah, that's just a move.' [end]
[start] Being that this is a programmer subreddit I can't believe people here think it's really possible to transfer your consciousness to a computer. It's flat out bullhockey.  At best, we will be able to make a convincing enough clone, but it will never go further than that. [end]
[start] Got me thinking... Maybe similar to cloning by genes and cloning by phenotype (cells)? [end]
[start] I drink straight from the 2000s 😂 Love it [end]

[start] Clone by reference can't be a thing IRL, because pointers aren't a thing IRL, because memory addresses aren't a thing IRL. [end]
[start] no well i guess [end]

[start] I wish I had a clone. One clone will be single and with no kids.  Since I’m the real one with a husband and a child.  I don’t drive. But the clone will. Lol [end]
[start] Clone by reference is just a hologram [end]
[start] Is it a clone of the master branch though? [end]
[start] Will love to see face of first scientists who will discover that god forgot to implement Serializable for Human. [end]
[start] Does our self exist somewhere else or is it part of the body? [end]
[start] Some people will not git it. [end]
[start] For real though, of course not.  No more so than identical twins are copies of the same person [end]
[start] The more important question is it clone by const ref or rvalue ref. [end]
[start] To Master Plo Koon, they are not the same person... and definitely not expendable. [end]
[start] I mean, if you clone a person they stay the same. That's like asking if they are the same person after having their blood drawn.  The clone of that person is a new person, though. [end]
[start] If you clone a person, it would be starting from a zygote and developing into a new human being. If there is a soul, it would be a different one because it would be developing a new nervous system so basically a twin.  If you were to copy every cell in a living person, they would be identical in every way and memory because all of that is a function of our cellular configuration.  When they began thinking the now separate entity would begin to form its own identity based on its environment. If it was a copy of you, and it knew that, just think about how it would make you feel if you were a copy of yourself. Unless you had prepared your psyche beforehand, they may be in for a not so great experience. [end]

[start] Technically, computers can't just transfer data. It must be copied, then the original position must be marked for deletion. [end]
[start] this sub is literally /iamverysmart without them even realizing it [end]
[start] If you create a clone indistinguishable from the original (same memories and everything) they are the “same person” just separate entities in space. Also there is no evidence of a soul, sorry to burst your bubble but you are your brain. If I cut out pieces of your brain and you change completely your soul doesn’t magically fit to the change, it simply isn’t a thing. [end]

[start] I would think that they will be the exact same copies for that single moment and after that, that's it. They will have new experience and just by standing at different positions they will already have different memories.  Sorry, not that much about programming... [end]
[start] You can always fork a person [end]
[start] By reference would imply not a clone but a reference.  For example if I passed a data table to a method by reference and that table is modified by that method, that isn't a clone, is it because the original table is modified?  Perhaps I'm missing something. [end]

Javascript CDNs and Google fonts are basically a standard (still unnecessary).  But then you notice the trackers. And ad servers. There are hundreds of them. Quite possibly way more. Google analytics and Ad-sense are the tip of the iceberg.  Every one of those domains receives a notification, that you are accessing that one site. If they have a referral URL, disabling cookies won't change any of that.  Please, start talking about this issue more. Cookies are far from being the worst thing on the internet. [end]

It's considered shitty user experience and these websites know they're a destination location so they say fuck it and use it anyway, then some disease law written by a congressman who barely understands what a cookie is gets alarmed and decided it's good to alert everyone that cookies should exist on every site a user exists.

After destroying my brain for another day trying to figure it out, I finally read the comments I MYSELF put in a year ago when I last updated this:  "Mattemer, the below code will need to be updated if xyz changes. You'll forget about this code a year from now, waste days trying to figure out why the updates aren't working, and you won't look at this, because it looks like nothing and also you're an idiot.

[start] <!--- Application up and running -->  I was working on a web application, and the code which initialized everything had that comment.  We were doing a conversion to Java, and this seemed benign, so I removed it.  We made dozens of other changes during this sprint as well.  It got all the way to production with no issues.    Once it got to production, the site went down.  In fact, every instance of the site went down across 12 servers.  Of course this happened when we moved the code at 2am, so we had to back out everything.  We then spent another few days looking at everything we did.  Turns out that comment was what the load balancer looked at to determine if a node was up or down.  No comment meant the node was not responding, so the load balancer marked it as down and removed it from the pool.  Removing that comment made the load balancer think every node was down, so it took them all down. [end]
[start] I hired a contract developer to make some changes to an old application.  He wasn't making good progress so I terminated him and when we opened up his code we found he'd used ascii characters to make a comment "Brad the Almighty" (obviously his name was Brad).  Two things though.  The comment was HUGE - like a couple hundred lines of text.   Also he misspelled "Almighty" so it actually said "Brad the Almightry".  The word "Almightry" is a running joke to this day. [end]
[start] First project of my computer science course i and a group of 4 students had to make a version of the 'Battleship' board game in PyGame. We had over 3000 lines of code and at least 800 of those were if statements. Yes, it worked, don't ask me how. [end]
[start] Inherited some old code from a developer who was no longer with the company where I worked. I soon discovered the reason why he was let go: In one particular instance of boneheadedry, he had a boolean flag on some data structure that was called `hasChildren`. Totally fine of course, but for some reason, that flag could get invalidated in his design. So in his infinite wisdom, he decided that the correct approach to deal with this problem was to introduce a second boolean flag he called `trustHasChildren`, which would be `false` when the original flag got invalidated. As a consequence, it would not be uncommon to see code like this:      if(!node.trustHasChildren()) {         // refresh children data     }     if(node.hasChildren()) {         // Do something with the children     }  Only, he misspelled it so it was actually called `thrustHasChildren`. Plus, the whole thing of course was totally thread-unsafe and just bad design all around. Facepalms for days. [end]

[start] Years ago working on a .NET project we used a particular piece of code from Microsoft. When we moved away from it later because it no longer suited our needs we found that if we didn’t leave a call to this one static method in our startup code everything would fail. I assume it had some sort of side effect that initialized something we didn’t know we were depending upon, but it got a comment along the lines of “this is magic, don’t remove” along with a longer explanation of the situation.

[start] I found some old code that called an deprecated DLL from an earlier version of the product (that we no longer had the code for, just compiled versions).  This brought up a popup box that said "SECRET FUNCTION: enter password".    I didn't know the password, but I did have the DLL and the function name, so I opened it in a binary editor and looked up the appropriate area of the code which had a string that said "billclinton" near the function call for the secret popup.  (The original DLL was written in the 90s).    I tried "billclinton" as the password and sure enough it worked... but the result was just to load an image no longer present in our build.   Much disappointment.  I've wondered what that image was for some time.  [end]

[start] Working on a huge rewrite for a client right now (classic ASP to Django/Python), and in several places there are a few hundred lines of what is essentially "if whateverID == 1224 or whateverID == 2334..." And on and on where they're doing special cases for some various reasons all checking for specific IDs off of various result sets. Hundreds at a time.  Honestly if there was a checklist of what not to do in code or in DB design, these people have checked off every box. I've been doing this kind of work for almost 20 years now and Ive never seen a mess as bad as this.  Edit: oh, they never used version control before we set them up, so there are thousands of lines of commented code everywhere. They used to "version control" by zipping up the code base every few weeks and FTPing it into a folder on the webserver. [end]

[start] From the [Jargon File](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/magic-story.html).   Appendix A. Hacker Folklore, A Story About ‘Magic'  Some years ago, I (GLS) was snooping around in the cabinets that housed the MIT AI Lab's PDP-10, and noticed a little switch glued to the frame of one cabinet. It was obviously a homebrew job, added by one of the lab's hardware hackers (no one knows who).  You don't touch an unknown switch on a computer without knowing what it does, because you might crash the computer. The switch was labeled in a most unhelpful way. It had two positions, and scrawled in pencil on the metal switch body were the words ‘magic' and ‘more magic'. The switch was in the ‘more magic' position.  I called another hacker over to look at it. He had never seen the switch before either. Closer examination revealed that the switch had only one wire running to it! The other end of the wire did disappear into the maze of wires inside the computer, but it's a basic fact of electricity that a switch can't do anything unless there are two wires connected to it. This switch had a wire connected on one side and no wire on its other side.  It was clear that this switch was someone's idea of a silly joke. Convinced by our reasoning that the switch was inoperative, we flipped it. The computer instantly crashed.  Imagine our utter astonishment. We wrote it off as coincidence, but nevertheless restored the switch to the ‘more magic’ position before reviving the computer.  A year later, I told this story to yet another hacker, David Moon as I recall. He clearly doubted my sanity, or suspected me of a supernatural belief in the power of this switch, or perhaps thought I was fooling him with a bogus saga. To prove it to him, I showed him the very switch, still glued to the cabinet frame with only one wire connected to it, still in the ‘more magic’ position. We scrutinized the switch and its lone connection, and found that the other end of the wire, though connected to the computer wiring, was connected to a ground pin. That clearly made the switch doubly useless: not only was it electrically nonoperative, but it was connected to a place that couldn't affect anything anyway. So we flipped the switch.  The computer promptly crashed.  This time we ran for Richard Greenblatt, a long-time MIT hacker, who was close at hand. He had never noticed the switch before, either. He inspected it, concluded it was useless, got some diagonal cutters and diked it out. We then revived the computer and it has run fine ever since. [end]
[start] I was tasked to fix some feature that was present for years that stopped working since last release. So I hopped in and started exploring. The deeper I went into the codebase, the more I started to feel like an Indiana Jones like adventurer, finding traces of a long lost civilization. This project has had so many people work on it and leave as quick as possible it was a complete mess, finding weird ass comments everywhere and just whole blocks of code completely useless and unnused or the same thing reimplemented over and over again. After a few hours finally finding the cause of the feature breaking I was completely flabberghasted. It was a commit from 4 years before and was as follows:  // TODO actual implementation  The fucking thing never worked in the first place and they didn't notice for 4 years. [end]
[start] We had a release that passed testing.  It passed review.  It worked perfectly in Dev environment, and in our low priority production environment.  It was perfect.  Until we deployed it in the main production environment where it would immediately throw weird exceptions.  They made no sense at all, but we needed the features of this release so we started debugging in prod (after trying to reproduce in Dev) and so we added a comment and a print and reran it.  No errors.  Must just be some transient thing.   So we reset the code on the production server to the master branch (just removing comments and printlines.  Immediately throwing errors again.  Fun. We add all the printlines back in.  Nada.  I get frustrated now and so I add a comment above it saying so.     The next recompile it works perfectly.  So then I delete all the printlines, recompile, it works, and I commit.  The commit's only diff is a single comment  (//added a touch of magic here) and the commit message is something like Fixed bug X using voodoo magic.     I committed and made a PR to master.  My boss comes over (small company so he was reviewing it) and he's like 'hey did you forget the code there?'.  I responded something like 'there were no code changes needed, it just needed a bit of magic'.   That error has never returned, and that comment is still there in production.  I may delete it when I go on vacation and see how good the newer coworkers are. :P [end]

[start] My favorite comment i found rrom a previous developer from a bug fix, presumably.  "Fuck me, this probably breaks everything. Here's a bandaid."  My favorite one that I accidentally did... I was cleaning up some code during an infrastructure upgrade on my own branch. When I didn't have time to address something immediately, I would tag it with //FIXME and a comment. One thing i came across was particularly... Dumb. It was obvious the original developer hadn't even attempted to think through the probkem, but it created enough of a mess that I would need to come back to it. I tagged it with "//FIXME No... Just, no. This is dumb."  Naturally i missed getting back around to it and the code went into review. The original developer was on the review and made an awkward comment about it. I had a bit of foot in mouth, tried to joke it asay, and cleaned it up. [end]
[start] An attempt to polyfill console.log that had every single line be a bug.  Excuse missing syntax as my new phone is odd.   If typeof console.log == undefined     Console.log("console.log is undefined")    Console.log= function (x)(      Console.log(x)     )   So first one is a bit understandable, but in every case that I know that console.log will be undefined (Early IE for example) console is also undefined, and so console.log will throw an error.   Second one is just wtf.  If console.log is undefined, call it, but you know console doesn't exist so even if you magically jumped the conditional you are either throwing a not a function error or a property of undefined error.   Then you assign console.log to a function, but once again, if console.log doesn't exist, console doesn't exist.  So this will be an error.      The real piece de resistance here is what the polyfill console.log will do.  It calls console.log.  So even if it magically managed to avoid every earlier bug and actually set console.log anyways.  Even if.  They just turned the lack of console.log from possibly breaking just our widget to locking the page with an infinite loop.   The greatest 4 lines of code ever written.  [end]

If you had a signing authorization for any amount other than $10,000, you had unlimited signing authorization and could cut a PO of any size, but you definitely weren't allowed to ship inventory anywhere.

[start] Two years ago, the developer of EVE Online released a massive rewrite of a huge chunk of the game: starbases.  The code was terrible and completely uncommented. The developer maintaining it actually passed away. They left it in the codebase for over 10 years.   Why so long?   Because every time they'd try to rewrite it, the game would hopelessly break and they could never figure out why. So they'd have to basically rewrite like a third of the game from scratch because for some reason shit like a ship turning its shields on would filter its way through this unreadable spaghetti code.

[start] I went to a coding competition in my junior year of high school. I wasn't too good, but wanted the experience.  One of the 10 challenge problems we worked on during the competition asked to decipher an alphabetic code (it was just the letters switched 13 places over).  Plenty of people did a simple little program that iterated through the characters and changed them if they were letters. But I couldn't figure that out. So I just put down 53 if/else statements, one for every letter, upper and lowercase, and the last as an else.  It worked perfectly.  TL;DR: I suck at coding. [end]

[start] This was a while ago (I left the company before I decided to harm myself)  and in PHP:  We were a marketing company and had our own custom CMS system that was totally not a WordPress ripoff. Long story short each of our customers wanted a different plugin to manage user tracking (everything from aloqua to Google tag manager). So some genius decided that the best way to do this was to write functions for each of those plugins and call them dynamically via their function names which were mapped to an array and stored in the database - with models generated by CakePHP  - the table names of which were prefixed with "a" or "e" or "x" based on the word because otherwise CakePHP would pluralize the word with "es" instead of "s" and they didn't like that.  [end]
[start] In the mid-90s, I was tasked to review the company I was working for at the time's in-house developed inventory and payroll system for y2k compliance.   The only comments were documenting the original deceased sole developer's slow descent into alcoholism and madness (only marginally work related).   It was both hilarious and depressing. I tried to offload some copies for posterity but their data security was surprisingly thorough.   A paraphrased sample:      {      Day 3 since the bender, my left hand still tingles      I don't know if it's CTS or neuropathy and I don't care      Today I'm writing bullshit about accounting for different      month lengths because apparently that's important for payroll      Fuck Andrew and his damn scooter     }  I never found out who Andrew was, or why his scooter was so abhorrent as to deserve a comment line in production software.   It was an interesting experience, with few actual things for me to do. Apparently Mr. Angry Drunk was a more competent coder than I would have been.   Just his comments were zero help in tracking down the few ShortInts and Bytes he used.  [end]

[start] In my teens I was doing an online test "how smart are you?". The questions were quite fun and tricky, but after finishing 10-15 of them I scrolled down to find that I had more than a hundred questions left. This was a form with radio buttons for the answers, and what I hoped to be a Javascript validation at the end. I opened up the source code, and there was nothing that would indicate that the answers were in the script, but just to check I opened all the included scripts no matter their names, and in them I found less obvious ways of including seemingly irrelevant files, which I then also opened. Eventually I got to a file, might even have been named Thumbs.db, and it starts with:  /* Ok ok, you found the answers. I guess it's better to be lazy and smart than ambitious and stupid. */  Followed by a clean list of the correct answer to every single question. I didn't bother checking what my result would have been after that. [end]

So you'd see a lot of things like       static int s_k = 0;     public string m_s;  I just always found it ironic how completely zealous he was to be super specific with hungarian notation, but refused to name things in any way that let you know what the variable did.  This is in Java and C# projects too, where Hungarian notation is essentially pointless with modern IDEs.  [end]

[start] I put in a comment saying something like “I don’t agree with the change below, but <boss name> forced me to do it and here it is”. We ended up working together in a different company years later and she said “you know I found your comment, right?”  Good times.  [end]
[start] I was teamlead of a group of programmers creating software for a large steel plant. One day, we released a new version of the code. Within 30 minutes, I had a very angry group of steel manufacturers at my desk, demanding the person that was calling them A**holes.  What happened was that a particular pice of code asked a question to which the answer was Yes or No. The enduser could respond whith a choice from Y,y,N,n,J,j,Yes,yes,Ja,ja,Nee,nee. Any other choise would be invalid and the question was repeated.  So far, nothing extraordinary. However, the programmer had build in a counter and after 10 wrong answers, the screen would light up in a bright color and say: No, you idiot, I want a Y or N  I had to remove this counter, although the foreman accepted my explanation. What was most astounding is that they found this within 30 minutes [end]
[start] I know CNC programming is likely thought of as simple shit here, but I work at a small family outfit and our head programmer has codes in his old programs that have absolutely nothing to do with the tool path required and often never even functioned with the software we use. And when you ask him about removing it, all he'll say is "if I put it there it was for a reason!" He just doesnt know the reason either. [end]
[start] I once had a coworker decide arrays start at 1 in PHP. He indexed the elements manually starting from 1. I thought that whole thing was a meme... [end]
[start] Is is where we make fun of other people's horrendous shit without remembering that we were the ones that actually wrote it 4 years ago?  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Is this DK64 code [end]
[start] "  ".split(" "); random placed in a application about twenty times. Two spaces split it with one space. Must be a cthulu worshiper.  [end]
[TITLE] Its a win-win situation [TITLE]
[start] Turn the weaknesses and bugs into features and everybody will like it. [end]
[start] > it doesn't save the messages  except everything is still stored on their servers [end]
[start] "Hey baby, wanna see my primary key" [end]
[start] Snapchat has changed a lot since it was released, but I remember a quote from the early days:  “Facebook was created by a man who never had a girlfriend. Snapchat was created by a man who had multiple girlfriends at the same time.” [end]
[start] QA: "This still seems to be buggy. The messages disappear quickly."  Dev: "Oh, it's not a bug, it's a feature!" [end]
[start] Is SQL the best way to store chat messages in an app? [end]
[start] Am I the only one that remembers it being advertised as the way to send nudes people can't save without you knowing it? [end]
[start] Fun fact: to comply with US data and investigation laws, Snapchat saves all chats and stories permanently on its servers. Your history is encrypted, and Snapchat will only decrypt for anybody under warrant from the FBI or other similar organizations internationally. [end]
[start] Can someone link me to a good SQL tutorial I would greatly appreciate it . [end]
[start] It's not that he didn't learn SQL. He just learned NoSQL. [end]
[start] Then you have the company and police liking it because the messages are saved, you just can't see them [end]
[start] He's just being relational with the handshake. [end]
[start] ... [end]
[start] Improvise. Adapt. Overcome [end]
[start] Except everything is saved. Fun fact. If you take a picture on Snapchat, even if you don’t send it to anyone, it’s saved on a database. Even funner fact, by making a snapchat account u agree to let them use any pictures u take in an advert. [end]
[start] Snapchat is dead. It was too complicated to add celebrities and influencers (oh boy, a special code!), and most of them have moved on to IG stories [end]
[start] Who said it doesn't save your messages lol [end]
[start] The first meme on this subreddit that made me actually laugh out loud. [end]
[start] I was thinking of this exact meme format when I learned how Snapchat works [end]
[start] I thought Snapchat does save everything on a database, though, not for users, but for the corporation to use how they want. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Why does someone like it? [end]
[start] Ahhhh, this is big brain meme [end]
[start] Because nothing is saved at all... [end]
[start] It's it's, son. [end]
[start] This post is underrated. [end]
[start] _let's just forget that snapchat does in fact save messages and they've been under fire for misleading marketing for it and that snapchat is a privacy nightmare who just got end-to-end encryption in late 2018 and that the founder of snapchat, Evan Spiegel, has repeatedly dodged questions on the secruity of the app_  Seriously though, don't send confidential stuff over Snapchat, it's not a secure platform. Same with Telegram and Discord. [end]
[start] Me and a friend are doing the SQL in our group which no one (including us) wants to do.  It is what it is... [end]
[start] Snapchat stores a shit ton of data. A shit ton.  That's why other apps are able to keep messages visible forever. [end]
[start] i thought this was a good thing until me and my ex broke up and i wanted to read back on our good snapchat conversations but they don’t exist anymore. like how people used to read the letters of their lost love and stuff [end]
[start] It doesn’t let you see their saved messages lol. [end]
[start] But now I never remember what we were talking about when I need to reply [end]
[start] Not good enough, we want win-win-win. [end]
[start] What is SQL [end]
[start] “That’s still basically a win-win [end]
[start] Snapchat saves everything, even the child porn that keeps getting sent. One of their main admins is probably jerking himself right now to some of them messages.  They're probably selling all that juicy face data they keep getting too. [end]
[start] needs night mode so bad [end]
[start] The funny-sad part: it could be true. [end]
[start] Win-win-win. We all win, even me. [end]
[start] Until the government comes around and ask them to hand over all the data [end]
[start] There is no such developer [end]
[start] Does snap chat use sql? [end]
[start] Its a beautiful day in the USA [end]
[start] Should we tell them about noSQL? And how they find his message and not someone else's? [end]
[start] Pleaseeeee elaborate I’m in the same situation. [end]
[start] Doesn’t Snapchat use React Native or Swift? Literally nobody cares about SQL [end]
[start] Lmaoo [end]
[start] I honestly can’t expect such a rush! [end]
[start] Oh, Snapchat saves messages. You just can't view them in the app. [end]
[start] This hits home. I've just never had a reason to use SQL yet since I've mostly made do in NoSQL-land.  I'm assuming one of these days I'll have to work on a RDB for work, I'll learn it then. [end]
[start] Mongo only, Docker only 😏 [end]
[start] > SQL  IMO any modern backend should use a framework to interact with a database. C# should use Entity Framework Core, for example. No need for SQL. [end]
[start] It’s a feature I swear! [end]
[start] Snapchat Engineers: We may have to delay the launch. The app has a bug - it can't save messages  Managers: Dude, that's no longer a bug, it's now a feature [end]
[start] I love Jim Carrey. It's a win-win. [end]
[start] They don't have space on their server [end]
[start] Yikes, except it does save your messages on their cloud, but right comedy. Haha! [end]
[start] #ChiComs: *It’s literal heaven in a tub. [end]
[start] In fact they have a database and they store almost everything from the user ... [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Unless you use the "delete messages after 24hrs" option [end]
[start] But what if the message are still available and you just don't see them.... thats what we call a soft delete [end]
[start] Then why can I view year old snaps that i havent opened yet? You're retarded just like your """"""joke""""" [end]
[start] If u think snap chat isnt saving ur vids then lmao [end]
[start] Ah so that's why I can never log in and always need to sign up for a new account everytime I use snapchat. [end]
[start] Everyone missing the entire point that the people you send them to can’t see them again 🤔 [end]
[start] I save messages on Snapchat though. [end]
[start] Good luck saving all that data in a SQL database. [end]
[start] Legit question here: who still uses Snapchat? [end]
[start] Funnily enough, Snapchat was created by members of another chapter of a frat I was in in college. The reasoning they gave for why it didn't save messages was because it was originally just meant for guys to send dick pics to girls without leaving any evidence later on that could be used in harassment charges or to mock them if they showed it around to their friends.  Why I never use the app [end]
[start] This is factually incorrect but funny. That developer probably saved them millions in storage costs.  But probably they still store that data somewhere [end]
[start] Snapchat definitely saves messages.  You need to scroll up on your conversations lol. Though it doesn't same snap pictures. [end]
[start] I giggled and peed a little [end]
[TITLE] Why would you hurt me in such a way [TITLE]
[start] I don't care what others say.    I get paid for writing my crappy code.    I'm a dev. [end]
[start] I'm a nurse. I just come here so I can throw an obscure joke at my programmer friends when they're being nerdy [end]
[start] No need to get personal, man. I mean that’s just, like, your opinion or whatever alright. [end]
[start] Jus take my upvote and leave man [end]
[start] ...But i use inspect element..... [end]
[start] Ah this one hurts. [end]
[start] Good because I don't understand 82% of the posts. \*goes back to visual scripting of game code\* [end]
[start] but it's a good start.. [end]
[start] my gf lurks this sub just to show me memes, I appreciate it honestly. [end]
[start] >tfw i subbed to programminghumor 5 years ago before becoming a dev then thinking i was a dev before [end]
[start] r/programmerhumor: you’re not a dev  me: well of course, I’m using the python flair aren’t I? [end]
[start] Yeah right. And the next thing you want to tell me is that the people participating in /r/relationship_advice aren't necessarily the best people to ask for advice? [end]
[start] Wait how old are most of the people here? Just curious [end]
[start] I understand most of them and the extent of my programming skills is a high school visual basic class 9 years ago. [end]
[start] :( [end]
[start] Then what's all this been about, why am I here..... what am I working towards [end]
[start] I can't be a dev because I don't yet hate my life enough to be called a dev. You can't be a dev until you loathe everything. It is then that you achieve the zen level of dev. [end]
[start] What if I get the memes AND know how to Google? Does that make me a dev? [end]
[start] I took literally 1 and a half programming classes almost 10 years ago and I understand most of these memes. Sorry boys, you gotta find validation in other ways. [end]
[start] I can print hello “your name” [end]
[start] But I write HTML 😭😭 [end]
[start] #*Understandable have a nice day* [end]
[start] Ah man, that's ruff. [end]
[start] I can believe cant I? [end]
[start] Why would you say something so controversial and yet so brave.jpg [end]
[start] I've never programed once in my life but I understand alot of coding and the memes. Now call me a dev. [end]
[start] As a DevOps engineer I feel personaly attacked [end]
[start] Ouch [end]
[start] I don't get it [end]
[start] This is the only reason that I'm in this subreddit to feel like a dev. [end]
[start] Ouch it hurts [end]
[start] r/gatekeeping ? [end]
[start] This hurts. [end]
[start] What have you been in the business for 18 years and you don't understand some of the memes? What does that make me? [end]
[start] As a PM, I sometimes forward these memes to the guys to make it look like I know what's going on. [end]
[start] See now compare this to the meme of the dude being made to sit down at the computer after joking they don't know how to get started programming. Same message. But this pokes an already nervous element. Why [end]
[start] Is mayonaise a programming language? [end]
[start] Bad boy [end]
[start] bro....stop [end]
[start] Ouch, this actually hurts [end]
[start] Do not. Pull me. Out of this dream. [end]
[start] This hurt right on the weak spot [end]
[start] My lord that was hurtful :( [end]
[start] Following dev memes for learning programming [end]
[start] Damn, came here for humour not to be called out. [end]
[start] Well.. If you unterstand the weird humour of development without being a developer, you kind of achieved... Something. [end]
[start] But does posting a programmer meme make you a dev? [end]
[start] I feel like this is a personal attack :( [end]
[start] This is extremely specific, I don't like that. [end]
[start] true. I really want to code, but my crippling lack of will prevents me to. Even though the only reason I'm getting an engineering degree is to be able to code [end]
[start] But... What does though... [end]
[start] I don't even understand the memes man WHAT AM I [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked. [end]
[start] Hot damn the imposter syndrome is upon us. [end]
[start] :( [end]
[start] I just started going to school for software development. One of my litmuses for progress is how many memes here I can understand without looking anything up. This dog speaks to me. [end]
[start] I'm a dev, and still don't feel like one. [end]
[start] Is this a personal attack? [end]
[start] oof [end]
[start] It was a biting remark. You lied. [end]
[start] I feel attacked. [end]
[start] and i would LOVE to tell 14 year old me that modding games doesnt either. [end]
[start] Too far man [end]
[start] LIES!!!! [end]
[start] Yea that one stung [end]
[start] Ouch [end]
[start] Never understood them. I'm hoping upvoting them will allow me to someday. [end]
[start] Jokes on you I don't understand the memes [end]
[start] As a lurker, I feel this in my soul. Insert the "I can't believe you've done this" clip here. [end]
[start] r/cryingupvote [end]
[start] Lol i dont even understand The humor, im just a park manager but i still think im a dev [end]
[start] Oof! Right in the GLLLLAAAVINNNNG. [end]
[start] Implying being a dev is a good thing.   \-Your friend, the sysadmin.   Ps. Debug your code before you push it on my platform next time so I can also enjoy my weekend. [end]
[start] I fucking withdrew from my CS major to go into writing. I am definitely not a dev. I’m still here to laugh at the memes. [end]
[start] Ya, I’m a scientists that occasionally writes simple scripts in R or Matlab to do things.  I can kinda follow these memes, but...I’m not a programmer.  Lol [end]
[start] Why you gotta be so mean to my one Java and 2 python 10 line programs :( [end]
[start] I learned visual basic, I'm a programmer! [end]
[start] Well of course I'm not a dev. I'm still in highschool [end]
[start] No 👏 one 👏 cares 👏 about👏 your 👏 programming 👏 knowledge👏 [end]
[start] The truth: getting hired as a developer makes you a dev. [end]
[start] Great, my morning is ruined now.. no I’m not crying!1!! [end]
[start] Funny.. last year I told myself and a friend that I know I would have made it when I can understand this sub. 🥺 [end]
[start] arrays start at 0 you are now a dev [end]
[start] Damn right in the spot [end]
[start] Exactly. To be a dev you have to have zero understanding of networking bare minimum. Backend must be unfathomable to you. [end]
[start] yo I'm right here [end]
[start] Lol. Lots of butthurt "developers" here. [end]
[start]  Hey /u/Sahil_32,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts. [end]
[start] Im a dev because I get paid for my code but I dont know why. The spaghetti code I vomit into visual studio is rarely even legible. Sometimes it works though so I guess that has to count for something. [end]
[start] Im just a PHP Dev, what do I know :( [end]
[start] Can comfirm. Understand most of these, am not proficient in any programming language. [end]
[start] Basically reddit. [end]
[start] I only know Minecraft MCFunction, Scratch and Roblox Lua ;-; [end]
[start] That hurts even as a dev [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Well yes, but you didn't have to [end]
[start] Technically being paid to write a hello world makes you a professional. [end]
[start] I am a professional scratch dev so i basically know how to do everything there is to know about programming [end]
[start] No, it’s not true. It can’t be true!!! I’m a dev too! I made a (barebones) mod one time! [end]
[start] Never in a million years did I ever expect to see a programming meme as the top post on Reddit. [end]
[start] XD [end]
[start] It is really offensive to consider yourself a dev just cause you understand a meme [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked. I understand only the c/c++ memes and yet I still think I'm big brain when I actually laugh at a meme on here. [end]
[start] Damn honest dog hurts [end]
[start] What's the original? [end]
[start] I dont even understand them 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 [end]
[start] Are we gatekeeping now?  As far as I care, once you write a `console.log` you're a part of the squad. [end]
[start] Does reading through stackoverflow make me a dev? [end]
[start] it me... [end]
[start] I do dev shit and I'm not sure I'm a dev [end]
[start] Hahahhaah [end]
[start] He hurt me because he said the thing [end]
[start] I see this as an absolute win! I've got a CS degree and spent a few years as a dev, but I've since transitioned into design and product management and enjoy my day-to-day work a lot more now. Respect to all devs, but it just wasn't for me.  The memes here are great though, so in the end my degree is really paying for itself. [end]
[start] Ouch that hurt be cause it's true. [end]
[start] me too [end]
[start] As funny as this is, in reality, I don't care. If you understand programming memes, you clearly know something about programming. I'm not going to gatekeep you about it. [end]
[start] Why you need to hurt me like this [end]
[start] Ouch [end]
[start] You mean, does he byte? [end]
[start] That hurts because I don’t even understand all the programming memes [end]
[start] Is this desirable? [end]
[start] Hey, I edit code in inspect element all the time. I'm a Dev in spirit lol [end]
[start] Does modifying a couple arduino sketches, with copy/pasting parts of different sketches i found online counts? [end]
[start] But I let my lab partner code an arduino breadboard once! How am I not a dev? [end]
[start] I mean I am happy because the ap class I took finally pays off [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked [end]
[start] I think this is the only occupation that someone would ever feel the need to gate-keep [end]
[start] I am aware of this and never thought about the situation in a different way. [end]
[start] Im not one, never will be, i dont have a brain for that, just enyojing the memes [end]
[start] Pffftt Anyone can be a dev.   The real gatekeeping happens when you are determining if someone is an software engineer or not. [end]
[start] Most programming memes on this sub apply to most office workplaces and are not specific to  programming whatsoever [end]
[start] "Just cause it's true doesn't mean that it's right"  -Bo Burnham [end]
[start] hurt? Why would that hurt me? I come here for the memes and I never coded in my life, why would that offend me? [end]
[start] Good lord.. this hurts [end]
[start]  I'm In This Photo and I Don't Like It [end]
[start] What about working as a programmer and not understanding most of the jokes [end]
[start] Fucking absolute savagery. [end]
[start] The more senior of a dev you become, the less likely you are to actually enjoy this sub. [end]
[start] Dev means developer. Am smart now? [end]
[start] Woah [end]
[start] Winston. [end]
[start] I'd be more sad if I really was a dev. What a crappy job. I'm just a guy who writes programs among other things. [end]
[start] I've never in my have been so offended by Seth i 100%/agree with [end]
[start] \*crying\* yes  \*sniff\* it does [end]
[start] I have high respect for programmers yet have no desire to learn their craft. Does that make me a bad person for bridging our lives through memes  T\_T [end]
[start] I don't actually understad any of your memes guys but i still like u all [end]
[start] Send it to the void* realm. [end]
[start] No mames [end]
[start] I feel attacked [end]
[start] Especially since most of them are general tech humor and not programming jokes [end]
[start] How dare you. I am shocked and appalled at this personal attack. Shocked! [end]
[start] Nah, too busy putting out dev’s fires in prod. [end]
[start] > Does he *bite*?  No, he's just a small dog... 🐩  But will **bit you 8 times** before you know it! 😁  \#AnnoyingSmallDogs #PunIntended [end]
[start] Jokes on you. I don't even understand most of the jokes. [end]
[start] Don't worry, the dog's name is kerberos and nobody understands him either. [end]
[start] It pains me that they used. [end]
[start] Probably wasn’t hurt though. [end]
[start] Fortunately, I understand web dev memes because I became one. [end]
[start] Aa a Com Sci student I feel personally attacked [end]
[start] joke s on you i don t [end]
[start] Why it's look like AMD ryzen dog [end]
[start] Guilty. [end]
[start] I know that I'm not good at programming but why do you must hurt me in this way  Jk great meme [end]
[start] Wait you guys understand the memes [end]
[start] So, conversely... [end]
[start] Big oof [end]
[start] Ngl, I just ask my bf what those memes mean. He explains, laugh, and then I stare at him because most of the time I still don't get it.  I just roam here to find stuff that'll make him laugh. [end]
[start] I'm in this picture and I don't like it. [end]
[start] Ouch my imposter syndrome [end]
[start] Bro. Right in the soul. [end]
[start] ;-; [end]
[start] Oh that got me right in the feels... [end]
[start] Good thing it's programmer humor and not dev humor then [end]
[start] ouch, that hurts [end]
[start] Can confirm. The only reason I understand these memes is because I dabbled in programming in high school. [end]
[start] Ouch [end]
[start] Can confirm, I don't even code that much lol [end]
[start] I feel called out *says the guy who doesn’t know anything other then HTML* [end]
[start] I'm a dev and I don't even understand all jokes on here [end]
[start] I don’t even understand some of these memes ☹️ [end]
[start] Me in physics:  hAhA pYtHoN mEmEs [end]
[start] I don’t code  I just come on to here to see if I understand stuff and feel like a dev [end]
[start] haha, I don't even understand the memes. I just follow this sub to show it to my dad. [end]
[start] Damnit. [end]
[start] I feel like one. [end]
[start] I mean shit, I'm glad not to be a dev. My ECE degree is why I get some of these jokes. [end]
[start] That hurt man. [end]
[start] Bro why would you directly attack me in this way. [end]
[start] I understand this meme, am i a programmer now? [end]
[start] I've understood the memes for a couple years now but only recently have I been able to create any of my own stuff [end]
[start] Just became dev today. Orientation as trainee today . [end]
[start] I'm absolutely not a dev, anything higher up that layer four in the iso stack gives me a nose bleed, I'm just here for the white hot memes! [end]
[start] Its the only reason I hang around though. [end]
[start] I am getting straight A‘s in my computer class but I learned half my knowledge from Tom Scott videos [end]
[start] this one hit hard [end]
[start] That's true [end]
[start] How dare you? [end]
[start] I don't even understand the memes most of the time.  I'm going to use this sub as a barometer to measure my programming knowledge.  I'll know I've finally learned enough when the memes make sense [end]
[start] I didn't follow this sub to get personally attacked [end]
[start] I feel my heart cracc [end]
[start] Why is he crying and dabbing at the same time [end]
[start] Haha I understand this one [end]
[start] Ouch [end]
[start] Just when I started to feel like one of the cool cats, the dog had to ruin it. [end]
[start] I don't even understand programmer memes. [end]
[start] Technically I make things in Python, even though I don’t have a job and I’m still in school and all the projects are for fun (ha)  I’m a dev... [end]
[start] Infrastructure dude here - I get the jokes but glad I don’t write code. Sounds like hell. [end]
[start] Is that supposed to be hurtful?  I celebrate not being a dev.  :) [end]
[start] So logically, if I don’t understand these memes, then I am a dev. [end]
[start] Also: being a dev doesn’t make you understand all the programmer memes. [end]
[TITLE] Hiring a Stack Overflow pro. [TITLE]
[start] That question has already been answered [end]
[start] "Didn't I ask you last week to finish this?"  "Closed as duplicate." [end]
[start] Too close to the truth.   Is there a reason that some people on stackoverflow are condescending or downright rude?  In addition to all the great people on there who have helped me out;  even though I’ve never had to ask a question, the answer has always been there. [end]
[start] "We only ask good questions and all good questions have already been answered so please just search stackoverflow instead of talking to me." [end]
[start] > _We need to ship this before end of the week._  _**Why**_ do you think you need to do that? [end]
[start] "this question is opinion based" [end]
[start] In all seriousness, what are the best communities for asking for help with programming? I generally get the answers out of SO that I need, but it is a bit draining reading through the nineteen patronising responses to discover the one that actually gives me the information I need.   As a hobby programmer, it's hard to know where to ask someone simple questions. Especially ones without a definitive answer. SO won't answer subjective questions like "what's the best way to manage assets in Visual Studio", or "what's the most typical way to apply simple encryption?".   Often I'm looking for answers that anyone who actually works as a programmer would know, but as a self-taught hobbyist I'm just making it all up and wondering whether there's an easier way. [end]
[start] [Sounds like you're trying to sneek on DS9](https://youtu.be/NG8bdmLsAfo?t=52) [end]
[start] Might just be me, but I'm noticed the following pattern on SO: With niche topics, the top answer is likely mostly or completely useless, the second answer isn't even an answer but some vague rant about using [framework/etc] to do [task], but the 3rd/4th answer actually answering the question.  I've seen plenty of SO posts where the top answer basically states "*This is  impossible with [framework/etc], but here is a vague approximation.*", with a later answer **literally** disproving the first answer by doing exactly what the original question asked for, within the specified scope and with the specified the framework/etc. [end]
[start] You can’t answer this question. Your reputation is too low [end]
[start] Have you searched this question before? [end]
[start] The sad part is that SO reputation means precisely nothing.  I spent a few months fairly active on SO... a decade ago.  I’ve gotten like 50 rep/day average daily ever since and am now at well over 200k and in the top .05%.  In the last decade I’ve probably answered 5 questions and asked 20 [end]
[start] "What are you trying to do exactly?" [end]
[start] Why should we hire you?  That's a stupid question.  Hired [end]
[start] I posted a question once on stack overflow and have never done it since, the people were so condescending and rude , was quite disheartening actually. Now I don't use stackoverflow at all if I can help it. [end]

[start] Anytime I write "Im a beginner" at the starting point of my question on SO, everyone is extremely helpful, no longer rude and even I have received private help from them in the SO chat. Its a good solution [end]

[start] StackOverflow nerds could easily make anyone disinterested in programming. When I was 13/14 I tried to ask a question (a pretty dumb one in hindsight) and something messed up and the question was submitted twice. I was attacked from all fronts obviously and later after asking another question I was IP banned from the site completely and couldn't use it in any capacity. [end]
[start] Stack Overflow pro: Is this some kind of a peasant joke that I'm too rich to understand? [end]

[start] Saving this for a repost. [end]
[start] I love arriving from Google to read the top answer is: >Just Google it [end]
[start] Not to defend StackOverflow too much (I think a lot of the critiques are valid and I am still not sold on community management). If someone asking questions on StackOverflow were paying my wage to do so I would treat it completely differently.  I never ask questions (well I asked a question but ended up self answering with what I had found and no one had a better solution). I gave up answering questions after spending time trying to help people improve their questions only to get frustration for not answering or people ghosting once they figured it out.  The original idea of the site was that if there are enough questions most won't need to be asked. It succeeded that goal for sure but too many new users treat asking a question as "I want to know" not "the solution isn't readily available on the internet". [end]
[start] Carl: "GuYs I fIxEd It ThAnKs"  *goes on without posting solutions*  Don't be like carl. Be nice and answer youre questions. Thanks. [end]
[start] The reason Stack Overflow is full of rude assholes is because there is a disconnect between the people who answer questions and the people who ask questions. The people who answer want this to be cool place where expert programmers hash out complex problems for the good of all. The people who ask are 99% not this. They’re first year CS degree students/majors who forgot that the array starts at 0.     So the answerers get annoyed because if the askers searched properly they’d find the answer. And mark as duplicate, or outright laugh at the newbs question.     Personally the answerers need to chill or just leave the site. Often times the asker doesn’t even have the right vocabulary to effectively search for previous answers. Or isn’t proficient enough to understand why *this* answer applies to their question. I see it like a different new student asking the same professor the same stupid question every year and by year 4 (the 5th year) the professor going... “I answered this last year!” That doesn’t help this years student!

[start] tbh I've seen a lot of people talk about users calling out questions for being stupid but I've \*never\* seen any question on a stack website being answered with "that's a stupid question". Sure, they get flagged as duplicate all the time but in my experience the answers are mostly helpful. [end]

[start] Programmers basically gaslight you on how easy everything is, cause they dont want to admit how sloppily software is being developed today [end]
[start] I stopped using stack overflow because every question I put up was answered the same way! I thought it was just me. It was like I get that you're so so smartical and would do this using python strapped to a c++ backpack underwater and blindfolded, but I just really need assistance figuring out this SQL error bc believe it or not, many companies can't afford to change the entire legacy system for a new report point. [end]
[start] SO really should split up into generalized questions applicable to all things CS, and extremely specific questions(despite essentially being “homework question” or “doing your work for you.”)  They may have done that by now, I haven’t used it in a long time. It wouldn’t even need to be a literal site splitting up, just change how certain tagged questions are displayed a bit. Anything to weed out the elitism. [end]

[start] The same people who are dicks on SO are the same people who are dicks on reddit and for basically the same reason. The SO nazi who spends all of their time browsing SO looking for new content to fill the hole they can't fill offline are enraged when they see a question they've seen before or a question they feel isn't to their level. The same with the repost nazi on reddit. They're browsing for the 50th time today, 500th time this week, they see a repost and they explode. In both cases they stumble upon content that doesn't feed their addiction. Like a smoker having a cigarette that contains no nicotine or a heroin addict shooting up heroin that contains no opiates. Both are going through the motions but not getting the satisfaction they once did. So they lash out. [end]

[start] I thought I was the only one who thought this. As a student who is new to programming, many questions I’ve asked that were apparently asked previously, actually had very little commonality with the link they provided for reference. I never really use stack overflow because of that. Most of the questions/answers are a little too high level for what I search for. [end]

I still trust them more than F`__`ya, irrespective of how extremely helpful specific F`__`ya experts have been in personally working with me to solve problems.  F`__`ya's support has repeatedly refused to stop (administators?/robots?) changing my answers to be *the literal exact opposite* of what I said **with no public indication of an edit** because their shit McAffee has declared that "you're a virus uploading hacker".  For some godsforsaken reason they stupidly could not comprehend that an expert might choose to use a common file-and-documentation container format to, *get this*, **package files with the documentation**!  If they actually believed I was uploading viruses then they whould have just banned me and deleted my answers; continuing to lie in my name is plain slanderous.  Frankly; That for years I've gotten the "X thousand [more] users have found your answer helpful" emails for other answers they've altered distressing.  ---  Actually; I should check if I can use GDPR to force them to fix *this*.

[start] A "real tree"...? What does he mean, like a tree containing floating-point values? [end]
[start] Presumably for the same reason that stacks grow downwards, as well. [end]
[start] This is an Australian tree [end]
[start] We should just start calling this "roots". It would make more sense. [end]
[start] Presumably because the people who formalised this stuff followed the western convention of writing from left to right and top to bottom.   [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Ah yes, Discrete Math. AT FIU, this class was known as the, "*you better be smart as shit because we aren't teaching you a damned thing here, but there WILL be tests*," class. [end]
[start] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow    Your move, mathematicians. [end]
[start] I guess math people know exactly how many leaves and branches they're going to have before they start writing it down, so they can start from the "top" and work their way down, but us poor comp sci types with our real-world use cases have to start with the one known (the root) and build outward from there. [end]
[start] I call them pine-ary trees.  There's one outside my window, which is how i know about it. [end]
[start] Oh good I remember discrete math. I started the course with a D and didn't understand it, which pissed me off, so I busted my ass and then all of a sudden a light bulb went off and I turned my grade into a B+. It ended up being one of my favorite courses because it felt like I was solving puzzles! [end]
[start] Because they are inspired by family trees? Guess this nonsense goes way before CS was invented.  [end]
[start] Were trees like this developed by computer scientists? Isn't this just a math phenomenon?  These kinds of trees are also used in game theory and other logic courses.    [end]

[start] Discrete Math was one of my all-time favorite (and most challenging) math classes ever.   I hope you learn a lot because the lessons in a good Discrete Math class you'll use forever if you're a programmer.   Calculus can largely suck an egg and I've not used it in 25+ years since I left college, but Discrete I use nearly every day between graph theory, set theory, combinations/probability and the like.  I hope you're enjoying it! :) [end]

[start] Tree roots spread exactly like that...  [end]
[start] I've been arguing for years this should be called roots. I've never felt so validated. NOW WHO'S THE CRAZY ONE HUH [end]

[start] That's some serious... shade [end]
[start] This tree is growing in the correct direction.  These so called "trees" that the author suggests exist outside of the room must be growing upside-down. That being said, the author also didn't include a picture of these "trees" so I am inclined to believe that they do not actually exist.  Checkmate mathematicians. [end]
[start] That escalated quickly [end]
[start] Well f** mathematicians! 😒 [end]
[start] The geometry folks get just as upset with the way we draw an X-Y Grid. [end]
[start] Trees have ROOTS guys [end]
[start] [Its a tree](https://imgur.com/a/gxLnMan) [end]
[start] Well, If you consider that a tree begins growing downwards underground with Roots....  [end]
[start] But that's just because of how you draw it. How you draw it doesn't change the fundamental concepts of a tree. Just draw it the other way if it makes you happy [end]
[start] My High School CS Teacher had the same response any time anyone asked him questions as to why anything was called something bizarre:  Because the people inventing these things, having nothing better to do but sit around and come up with these crazy unheard of ideas, would routinely meet up, sit around the bar, and whoever came up with the weirdest name for that night didn't have to pay for drinks.  Makes more sense than any explanation I have heard to date. [end]
[start] Hey to be fair the root is at the top  Edit: if you think about it a tree is just a long log with roots on both ends. Except the roots we see are in the sky (reppin north side) and collect energy from the sun. Roots reppin south side collect energy from the earth. [end]

[start] If you project a tree through a window and (through a prism) onto paper, it will look growing downwards, as you would otherwise be sitting in the way. The same goes for stacks.  Most likely, FM textbook writers think so highly of themselves they write on their ceilings. [end]
[start] You just took a peace of paper and set that book to give the illusion that the book actually said that and took a picture it’s clearly not in that book  [end]
[start] Wait how many trees are U shaped? Most of the ones I’ve seen are shaped like that [end]
[start] Is your book by Eriksson and Gavel?  [end]
[start] oh shit boi, bless up [end]

[start] Doerr and Levasseur? [end]
[start] Quick someone fire back [end]
[start] Can confirm [end]
[start] “Roots” would make a lot more sense. Drawing the tree upside-down wouldn’t work well because our culture writes top to bottom. It feels unnatural to start at the bottom of the page and move up. [end]

[start] Oh hey, look at that complete tree [end]

[start] [Oh yeah and we're the assholes...](https://books.google.com/books?id=MlEEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA173#v=onepage&q&f=false)  This entry was published in 1857 and marks the coining of this mathematical structure as a 'Tree'.  Arthur Cayley (a mathematician) drew the trees in the way modern computer scientists draw them. From top (root) to bottom (leaves).  Your move mathematicians. [end]
[start] That reminded me of my logic textbook where on one chapter they introduced a "turbo proof for the real try-hard mathematicians" [end]
[start] Computer scientist think they're engineers, engineers think they're phisicysts, phisicysts think they're mathmeticians, and mathmeticians think they're God, but God... God is biologist.  [end]

[start] You could flip it upside down while stilll getting the point across [end]
[start] the official term is "state diagram", and it can poke its own head with its ass, the math guys mistaken it and called it tree because they never saw a real tree or a diagram before [end]

[start] I was under the impression that one large, minified js file that all your separate js files get compiled into was actually the best approach in the long term. That's just what I heard from one of our senior devs though, so it could be wrong/outdated. [end]
[start] From my experience with web developers, most include huge js libraries just to use functions they could have written themselves with about 5-10 lines of vanilla JavaScript. [end]
[start] From the perspective of a game developer:  Web dev 2020: lets just serialise the whole object with lots if verbose structural padding, like a 10 levels deep json object.  Game dev 2020: If we can infere this state on client and server independently and reduce this enum with one value, we can save one bit on each state synchronisation. [end]

[start] As a former game dev this is annoyingly true. No where are you taught any good habbits for data reduction and even in professional games you see lazy things like 3D renders with its edit history still intact which increases its file size and, depending on the engine, can be visible (usually as this weird white fuzz that covers the object) [end]

[start] This is why I balk at anybody claiming that game developers know how to do things right, better than other computer science fields.   Speaking as someone who decided very early on NOT to go into that industry, they pay like shit and they treat their employees even worse than dogshit. Their entire buisness model is around how quickly the programmers can get the game ready to ship. In what world would that produce anything but code with massive technical debt? How can that not produce substandard practices ingrained into the developer? [end]
[start] I know a couple web developers and I've made some websites too. You might start out all efficient and clever, but fast forward a year down the line and the same website has 5 includes of the entire jquery library and your backend is spitting flames [end]
[start] Is this a joke. Web developers in 2020:  Heres a pop up to accept cookies, here's a pop up for a coupon code, here's a pop up for our news letter, here's a pop up for a chat that doesn't work. Here's a video that autoplays, here's a request to download our app that has 50% of the capability of the website. But you have to use it because our Mobile site barely runs and is slow as hell even though it's running on a phone with a quad core and 4gbs of ram.

[start] I uninstalled fucking modern warfare from my computer. Lick my weiner bro it's at like 200GB at this point. How is it that big and Escape From Tarkov, a game with (arguably) the same amount of assets like 17GB? [end]
[start] Because there's no core dependency after you compile everything. Frameworks like React and Vue ship with virtual DOMs and other core features. Svelte compiles itself out of the equation so when you load an application built with svelte your only getting the application or code you wrote, not svelte itself. [end]
[start] I have somewhat lackluster internet at home, and I straight up need to remove myself from some activities online just because no one actually designs for people with bad internet. It's ridiculous, a decade ago everyone had my internet, and now I can't download certain games, or watch certain content because it's not possible.  I was submitting a video for a conference not too long ago, there was a rather large filesize limit and my internet was stable enough to upload it. However, there was a one hour timeout on the webpage. Regardless of whether my internet could upload the video, it had to be able to upload the video within an hour.  I contacted the admin, asked if there was some way to refresh the timer (I was actively watching the upload but couldn't refresh the page because it would interrupt the upload) and the dude was like "lol can't fix your internet". Like WTF! THE WHOLE PAGE IS JAVASCRIPT! NO ONE THOUGHT TO PUT IN LIKE A LITTLE BUTTON THAT SAYS "I'M STILL HERE" THAT POLLS THE SERVER AND REFRESHES THE TIMER WITHOUT DESTROYING YOUR UPLOAD?!‽ I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS ISSUE!!  Or like when you need to download a program and it's like 100 gb and it's all done as a single file! Of course my internet's gonna crap out at some point! And you're telling me I've just got to start all over again? You're aware that we have the technology to make it so that if the download is interrupted you can pick it back up again, right?  Or like what the hell is up with outlook? Why does it take my connection like five minutes to go from my inbox to actually being able to write an email or look at a message? What in the world is your website downloading in the background that I'm not seeing or using?  I just don't understand how the world grew up on bits per second of internet speed and now if you don't have fiber you might as well go read a book instead. [end]
[start] On top of that I've noticed the Steam downloader works funky so that if you are downloading a game and run out of space or internet connection the partial game you downloaded is still hogging up space on the disk and you have to redownload the whole game to get it to garbage collect the incomplete download. [end]
[start] Which web developers are worried about size these days? I feel like every website I visit these days has just as much garbage as my video games. [end]
[start] My laptop only has 250 GB because it was 300 cheaper than equivalent specs with a terabyte. It's very annoying when games are 50 GB+. I'm looking at you Fallout 4 with your 94 GB download. [end]
[start] What if games are setup to be a sort of DropBox for game devs?   “I need somewhere to stash this porn, I’ll just stick it in the update and download it on-demand, muhahahhah!”  J/K, some game devs have the worst goddamn jobs. [end]
[start] All fields of programming are closer to the latter tbh. There's no reason why Facebook messenger should take fucking 2 to 5GB of RAM alone just like there's no reason a video game based on arenas should take over 60GB of storage including fucking 15GB of sound files.  We just got lazy with optimisation, and instead of using the larger faster storage/RAM available these days for adding features we just use it to not have to worry about optimising.  As for JS specifically: remember the is-odd and is-even packages exist. [end]
[start] I'm convinced that some games inflate the data in games like crazy to make it seem like there is a bit more content then there really is, because I know I got really giddy when seeing how much data was in RDR2, or TLOF2. Not that I didn't get my money's worth or anything, both are amazing games. [end]
[start] As if webdevs optimizations actually have noticeable effects on load times.  We get 3KB of actual text wrapped in a 132KB of "optimized" HTML, 13 MB of images that someone in design slapped all over the site, and 326 MB of Flash, trojans, and ludicrously bad Javascript supplied by the ad networks. [end]
[start] You haven’t seen NPM, have you? [end]
[start] Also web developers: if we gang these 5 JavaScript files together we can reduce the number of requests made, which makes the site load faster... [end]
[start] Streaming RDR2 is gooood [end]
[start] I think the key thing here is that with web dev, you can switch out the files to cater to what the users has to load. You're not sending them all the files to run on their machine.  Video games is different, you gotta download the whole shebang whether or not you're using it [end]

[start] I was so pissed when I bought Modern Warfare. I already had Warzone. I was playing with friends. It's a shitty BR, but what isn't? They do free multiplayer weekend. Cool, I forgot how fun team deathmatch and hardpoint can be. Decide to buy the game to keep playing multiplayer, but for now we're a little burned out on it. Go to play some more warzone. Can't. What? I have to download the entire main game to play just Warzone even though I already have Warzone installed. Can't do it in the background either. Game won't even launch anymore without the full download. And due to the sheer stupid size of it I have to get rid of every other game on my computer to make room. Play warzone for a further week or so. Never touch MP again. Uninstall soon after. 1/10. Not worth. [end]

[start] I built a brute-force hash cracking program at a place I used to work that opened up an offline file from the client, took some configuration options and then worked through all the possibilities.  It was more of a "I wonder if I could" moment to see what would happen and how long it would take rather than needing to do it for work.  It was pretty fast but looked really boring so I included an option to have the hashes and guesses flash up on the screen to make it look like the films.  Looked much nicer but slowed the whole thing way down.  Edit: I know there are lots of ways to speed it up, like separating threads and only showing n^th guesses. I could have even updated it for parallel computing but there was no point as it was made as a testbed and replaced with an alternate method a couple of days later. Thank you for taking an interest though and providing ideas on how to improve the concept. [end]
[start] Also, if there is a photo and the picture is not clear, saying ENHANCE should make that pixelated bitch so clear that you can see every single pore on their face.  [end]

[start] Friend of mine is a skydiver and was bitching about the wingsuit scene in the new Point Break being completely ridiculous. I told him "Welcome to every hacking movie I've ever watched." Though I was kind of impressed with Mr Robot when one of the guys uses find and routes stdout to /dev/null so it'll only print the error messages and tell him if there are any directories on the system he doesn't have access to, thus uncovering the evil rootkit. That's really a lot of attention to detail for a scene that lasts a few seconds and which would probably not be noticed even by most regular Linux users. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] In the background, can you also display seven lines, all perpendicular to one another? [end]
[start] Well sometimes showing stuff like this makes your user think your program is doing stuff rather than have crashed, in those cases this might not be a bad idea, as long as the extra work isn't slowing you down too much.  [end]
[start] Have you watched s04e03 of Black Mirror?  That's exactly what I thought today while watching it. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Also it should make a bunch of bleep bloop noises every time it changes a picture, or wheb you type something. Cuz every fucking program has to make noises according to tv series.  [end]
[start] I remember in my younger, more rebellious days I would have screamed, “No F’ing way.  That’s stupid.  That’s not even how facial recognition works.  Nobody would ever create a facial recognition search that had to display every non-match.”    Now, as an older, wiser manager, I say, “What a great F’ing idea.  I’ll shoot you over a change order for that and we’ll bill you an additional 180 man hours.  Plus we’re going to need a database of faces and a bunch of new graphical stuff.  And it will require upgrading the hardware because what you’ve got will be too slow and choppy so, figure another $10K in hardware.”   The Project Manager’s boss calls and says, “Hey, I just got an invoice for $150K for some facial recognition special effect!!!  What the hell are you guys trying to do, rip me off?”    And then I say, “No sir.  Not at all.  Project Manager added a bunch of new requirements and we’re just billing you at cost for all of the extra work that he wants done.”    Later that afternoon.    Project Manager calls, “Hey, my boss wants to kill the facial recognition thing.  Let’s just stick with the original plan.”     Me, “Really?!?!  Wow, that was going to be so killer.  Anyway, we’ll still have to bill you for the work we’ve already done preparing but we’ll stop everything right now.”     [end]
[start] Well, if it always displays the closest match it has found SO FAR, the results would be pretty similar. [end]
[start] The customer writhed in agony, demanding to know why he was tied up and being interrogated.  “It’s like this.” the project manager said. “I was having a scrum meeting and the new guy tells me to blow myself. I ask why, and he says all this Agile stuff is bullshit. It’ll take two, three years to finish a game that should only take one. So I tell him, sure, we could design upfront but then it won’t be what the client wants. So he says, you just tie the client down and beat him til he gives up the design instead of letting him change his mind every sprint. So here we are.” [end]
[start] *The technician glared at her, snatched the photo out of her hand, and scanned it in.

Flashing faces on the screen or something as it goes through them.”*  *“Or,” said the technician, her tone gilded in sarcasm, “we could dedicate that processing time to, you know, scanning more faces per second.”*  *The machine sat there, quietly humming. Jason picked his teeth. “This is boring.”*  *“This is my job. My work. Work is boring. That’s why they call it…work.” She snorted. “I mean, you think hacking is sitting down in front of a terminal, tapping a few keys, putting on some dark glasses and then saying, I’m in?”*  *“I…don’t really know what it’s like.”*  *“No, you don’t.

[start] Project Manager: Make it so you have to enter lots of keyboard commands for it to work.   Programmer: Why? This version you just need to click once to upload the picture and once to press 'OK'.   Project Manager: Just do it! [end]

[start] Over at /r/tvdetails - someone posted about how Bob Newby  in "Stranger things 2", who hacked a computer, actually used real 1980's era password cracking. A screenshot of what was on his screen was perfectly authentic and real. There were clicks of a keyboard, and no other bleeps and bloops or any computer science tv/movie tropes.   It was completely believable and I was fully immersed. You don't need bleeps and bloops and distractions and two people typing on a keyboard at the same time and silly jargon.  [end]
[start] Also, it needs to make lots of beeping noises so everyone around knows it's a computer. [end]
[start] But it needs sounds! Where are the sounds!? [end]
[start] Yeah, but people put up with the slide show since the program always finds a match in 30 seconds. [end]

[start] I feel like you made this post because of the Black Mirror ep3 I saw last night. So much attention to detail but yeah let's run useless facial recognition code displaying all database faces. Literally only problem I had with that episode as it kind of ruined the believability. [end]

[start] [Someone's gotta link it](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs) [end]
[start] Your tab key is incorrect. Look at your keyboard. The right-facing arrow is on the bottom because that's the default behaviour. The left-facing arrow is above the right-facing arrow because if you use `SHIFT`+`TAB` it'll go to the left. (i.e. it's the same as the number keys - hit `SHIFT` to get the upper character) [end]
[start] Tab Gang rise [end]
[start] Joke's on you my tab produces two spaces. [end]
[start] This party is sponsored by anti-Yaml club. [end]
[start] I can't code and get it. You've gone mainstream boys and Julie. [end]
[start] indent: 8 tabs   tab-width: 0.5 spaces [end]
[start] Space gang is just repeating yourself and the first rule of coding is to never repeat yourself. Take that space gang [end]
[start] Tab clubs always bounce spaced out guys in trench coats. [end]
[start] Does any one have a practical reason to use 4 spaces instead of tab? I mean we build yaml files and use single spaces to indent (I was told that was standard) [end]
[start] Four spaces in a trench coat walk into a bar [end]
[start] I wonder if the reason there are two arrows is because "shift-tab" would go backwards. Also, I think you got the arrows backwards (at least for me, the left-pointing one is on top). [end]
[start] Spaces will make their own club. With blackjack and hookers! [end]
[start] I think that people who use spaces are the same people who put spaces and newlines in Word documents instead of properly positioning. [end]
[start] The arrows on the tab symbol are in the wrong order. The left arrow should be above the right arrow. [end]

[start] This, I had a professor a year or two ago who at the beginning of the semester took points off if you used tab instead of four space. Needless to say the Comp Sci department received a lot of reports for her and suddenly we got points back a  few weeks into the semester. [end]

[start] Tab Gang rise [end]
[start] Man dis deep [end]
[start] 4 spaces? What a monster! 2 spaces is more than enough [end]
[start] I'm a tab guy myself. However, four spaces is the recommendation for python. Luckily, I can use tab and have the editor convert them to spaces.  It's like solving world issues. [end]
[start] Python must have written this. No other language cares about intermixing indentation. [end]
[start] Is there a legit reason to use spaces in 2020 ? [end]
[start] The actual reason tabs are better is because one can customize the width of a tab, but not the width of multiple spaces. [end]
[start] /u/anishrt that's what he told u? [end]
[start] Spaces are better. Change my mind. [end]
[start] You shouldn't really every need to insert indents *(tab or space)* manually *(unless you're using Python)*, most languages can be indented by just opening a block with a newline, and then subsequently you can use an on-save hook to make your formatter can clean up the rest.   This is mainly why people get annoyed by indentation based languages, it makes automatic formatting harder, and deep indents unmaintainable as a result, which is why the Python programming guideline is so strict about indent-depth. [end]
[start] So much easier to just use all spaces. Set your editor to insert 4 spaces when you press tab and you can literally never have to think about it again [end]
[start] You don't really want to hang out in places like that anyway. Its an inconsistent experience depending on the manager. The space gang will always deliver on expectations. [end]
[start]  DIE U SPACE HEATHENS!!! FOR THE ONE TRUE GOD!! TAB!! [end]

[TITLE] True happiness [TITLE]
[start] I actually compulsively close my tabs. Too quickly sometimes that I have to reopen my last 5 closed tabs to find the one I shouldn't have closed so fast. [end]
[start] Step one: open 100 tabs searching for solution  Step two: solve issue  Step three: start closing the tabs, PC freeze because Chrome deleted your RAM  Step four: restart PC  Step five: realized you didn't save the changes  Step six: open more 100 tabs looking for the one that had the actual solution [end]
[start] So that's why I can't be happy. It's because I'm using Firefox.  ^(It's really good though. Please don't hate on my fav browser) [end]
[start] I love how almost each application/game/website is so different, and programming can be done in so many ways that obscurity is common [end]
[start] Its not even obscure bugs for me. Im a beginner and its extremely challenging but very exciting when you solve something. This week I learned how to procedurally generate a tile world based on a seed. Many of you could probably do that in your sleep but it was a huge achievement for me. [end]
[start] Nah man, closing tabs is nothing against `git commit -m "fixes #455, #421, #65, #456, #457, #458. Touches #459, #502"` [end]
[start] Credit @cszhu https://twitter.com/cszhu/status/1230954186520461312?s=19 [end]
[start] Yeah. Maybe if you have enough RAM to open 100 chrome tabs [end]
[start] "Oh wait it is actually not yet fixed"  *Spams ctrl shift T* [end]
[start] I'm stuck in the limbo of this.  I don't enjoy programming enough to do it in my free time, but at work I get enough out of it that my day passes smoothly.  And then I get home and do nothing.  Look forward to nothing.  Enjoy nothing.  Just try to find things to pass the time.  I've tried programming to fill the void but I have 0 intrinsic motivation. [end]
[start] Implying you're not closing those tabs because finally you found a post where the same bug you have was solved by somebody else. [end]
[start] C# Zhu [end]
[start] Wait, you guys close your tabs? I just buy more ram. [end]
[start] I never close tabs after I fix the bug I mean I could  reuse the info I have 3 tb ram [end]
[start] To be fair though, the happiness came from somebody else on Stack Overflow [end]
[start] I recently had to write code using ancient Unix magics from things it turns out really aren’t documented.  After getting it working and closing the tabs, it asked if I was sure I wanted to close the 1020 tabs (Not Chrome;).  That felt good. [end]
[start] Sometimes I go down a wormhole with a bunch of unhelpful links so I need to go nuclear on all of the tabs and then of course, re-search and reopen the same damn links. [end]
[start] Your RAM will be happy too! [end]
[start] It's like saying money won't make you happy if you are not happy without it. I am not happy when I am hungry and I am not happy when I am horny [end]
[start] The computer doesn't talk back. For now, at least. [end]
[start] If you had 100 tabs open clearly you were hoping that someone else had solved your bug, no? So I'd rephrase it as:  >True happiness comes from describing your enigmatic error in exactly the right keywords so that the first page of search results Google returned contained a link to stackexchange that describes your situation exactly and have a highly voted answer. [end]
[start] As the glitch gets darker and more misterious, the answer is more stupid [end]
[start] *Firefox tabs [end]
[start] This is only true when the “obscure bug” isn’t just a typo [end]
[start] True true happiness comes from closing 100 firefox tabs [end]
[start] There's not enough RAM in the world to have 100 Chrome tabs open. [end]
[start] True but I couldn’t look exactly happy. [end]
[start] #true [end]
[start] An ex had 200+ tabs open on her chrome when we were first dating. When she wanted to visit a new page, she opened a tab and went to the page, even if she already had it open. I closedall her tabs and she said her computer was "going a lot faster since you fixed it. "  She knew ctrl+t gave her a new tab, but she didn't realize all the other tabs were still open and running. [end]
[start] You can shift+click tabs to select a whole range of them, then ctrl/cmd + w to close all of them at once.   Seeing all those tabs disappearing into the ether one by one is the most satisfying thing since the Solitaire win screen in Windows 3.1. [end]
[start] And after the 10,000th bug... will you still be happy?  And after the 10,000th night going home to an empty house... will you still be happy? [end]
[start] Y'all mfs tellin me that loneliness can't be cured by a soulmate by my side? [end]
[start] > Chrome tabs  kek [end]
[start] I wish you every happiness in the world haha [end]
[start] but the anxiety comes back cause the bug is still there and i have to reopen and research [end]
[start] That damn feeling. [end]
[start] :D [end]
[start] Yes! And the wholesomeness that you learnt something new. [end]
[start] Let’s start our journey to true happiness by closing chrome first ;-) [end]
[start] Wow, I needed this. [end]
[start] I usualy exerience true happiness moments before closing the 100 chrome tabs in utter shame. [end]
[start] "Close all on the right" [end]
[start] True, they might run out of bullets. [end]
[start] YES [end]
[start] must hide this post from gf, she would be annoyed that i'm not telling her anything. not talking with her when i'm busy debugging [end]
[start] Tab recovery is the best. Leave work, arrive the next day and realize my PC restarted. Firefox asks if I would like to reopen my 32 tabs. *insert popular shocked meme* [end]
[start] A true genus [end]
[start] True, but they are kind of fun. [end]
[start] Now i understand why I'm not happy, because i close the tabs too early, i need to keep it until i solve the problem.   Omg, the answer were that simple and I've never realized [end]
[start] \#closetabphobia [end]
[start] "Chrome" LOL [end]
[start] Wow i never realized how much joy that actually brings me and that its a thing other devs enjoy as well. [end]
[start] Amen. [end]
[start] I needed this right now actually, especially from another woman. [end]
[start] I use a chrome extension called OneTab when I have too many tabs open. Closes them all into one and you can still navigate to the pages from the OneTab. Check it out! [end]
[start] I've had to close 100 tabs before, but it wasn't after fixing a programming bug. [end]
[start] I disagree. True happiness is when someone hires you for your abilities and doesn't reject you because you're on the spectrum. [end]
[start] Oh my god yes [end]
[start] Slightly related question, is there a short cut to close all windows and/or tabs, except a few selected ones, at once? [end]
[start] Hmm, id like to check out her terminal. [end]
[start] Can confirm! Happened to me last week, damn that's a good feeling! [end]
[start] Ciso [end]
[start] Amen! Preach! [end]
[start] But I like my little happy face logo :( [end]
[start] She's not wrong. [end]
[start] >BUILD SUCCEEDED  proceeds to hold down cmd-w for 10 seconds [end]
[start] I tend to forget which tabs are for which bugs so I keep all of them open until i need to have multiple instances of unity, visual studio, and Excel open - the combination forces me to make decisions about tabs. [end]
[start] 20 tabs may be duplicated out of 100 tabs. [end]
[start] Do you mean bookmarking them in a separate folder on my bookmarks bar so I can right click the folder open all as tabs later? Because absolutely. [end]
[start] Well, youve never made a sandwich for someone else and gotten foot rub [end]
[start] Not a dev but a T1-T3 helpdesk monkey. This is why I'm still pissed that the chrome devs thought it was a good idea to get rid of the "Close other tabs" and "Close Tabs to Right" button. [end]
[start] happiness comes from an obedient div [end]
[start] I was part of a startup company.  We had one major client that was on the other side of the globe.  I was still working my day job while programming the applications for this new company.  I had a bug that caused the program to crash often - sometimes more than once per hour.  I had to manually reset it every time.  So I had an alarm that went off loudly to WAKE ME UP when this happened.  I did not sleep more than 30 minutes in a row for weeks, while still trying to work at my day job.  I had a laptop, and I programmed on the train during my commute.  The day I figured out what the bug was, while on the train ride home, was the happiest day of my life.  #3 was the day I got married.  #2 was the birth of my son.  #1 was the moment I realized I was going to get a full night of sleep because I quashed that stupid bug.  True happiness.  Side note - I cannot listen to Guns N Roses “You Could Be Mine” without getting PTSD - the riff near the start of that song was the alarm I set to wake me up. [end]
[start] Right click, close tabs to the right [end]
[start] I wanna find this girl's bug now. [end]
[start] ; [end]
[start] HaHahArGar....  Not. [end]
[start] True I love me some hash browns [end]
[start] This. This right here. [end]
[start] Preach [end]
[start] r/oddlysatisfying [end]
[start] True, it’d hurt your knob. [end]
[start] True. I'm not even a joke [end]
[start] What utterly moronic advice. Only a woman can give that kind of dating advice because finding a guy is effortless and therefore she doesn't value men. [end]
[start] disqualified because you're using chrome [end]
[start] I felt this in my soul. [end]
[start] r/suspiciouslyspecific [end]
[start] Then you have found out the fix won't work, and you have to reopen that 100 tab again [end]
[start] So relatable. [end]
[start] That gave me a big pp erection [end]

[start] True Blood  Mad Men  Edit: it’s foolproof [end]
[start] extrusions can’t buy happiness, but it flopped. [end]
[start] True but I’ll do [end]
[start] True but I guess it's coincidence though? [end]
[start] "chrome"  fucking bleh [end]
[start] When it started with the "closing 100 tabs" I thought this post was going a different direction. [end]
[start] True but I don't understand your question. [end]
[start] True enlightenment is grabbing the source code of the framework you're using and remembering that people who like to talk frameworks like they're the solution to everything are just spewing buzzwords and that, at the end of the day, a framework is just another collection of logic and if statements that can be understood and manipulated. [end]
[start] True happiness comes from using Elm [end]
[start] unless solution to her programming bug was posted in one of those 100 tabs (who even uses chrome ffs) by itself, it was someone else who gave her her happiness. [end]
[start] True. I must say, is that ok?? [end]
[start] And true depression comes from closing 100 tabs after attempting to fix a bug you introduced and completely failing and giving up because it’s 5 in the morning [end]
[start] This but with Visual Studio tabs. [end]
[start] Not a programming bug but I solved a firewall issue by getting a syntax error when I mistyped a command.  Literally nothing else changed but after the error the bug went away [end]
[start] No, True Happiness is when tour CPU is at 99%, Memory at 100%, but you know that SOMEWHERE in those 4 chrome sessions of 100 tabs each is the answer to that obscure bug you had to fix that probably won’t ever pop up again, *but also might*, and when it does, you will be able to fix it!  If you can get your mouse to actually move to that tab, that is.  Its stuck on the close button for task manager atm. [end]
[start] In third world countries, happiness is being able to open 100 chrome tabs without your computer crashing [end]
[start] But I'm unhappy because I'm lonely....mainly... [end]
[start] Finally found the fix for that problem!  *looks at RAM usage*  *110%*  Oh no [end]
[start] These are facts. [end]
[start] To be fair i'm actually a lot happier in a relationship than i ever was single  Ya'll be dating wrong [end]
[start] If you accidentally close all or "all but this" then that's the exact opposite of happiness even though the results are the same. [end]
[start] Andddddd you have your Chrome's On Startup setting as Continue where you left off. [end]
[start] I have so many tabs open sometimes they call me the Human Memory Leak [end]
[start] First, I wanted to object, then I read the second half. Nothing will ever beat that feeling. [end]
[start] >not from someone else  if you have all those browser tabs open, you are relying on someone else to solve your issue.   You may need to find the information, but someone else put it out there and is paying to make it available for everyone, including you,  to find. [end]
[start] Bull [end]
[start] True words. [end]
[start] why won't pytorch garbage colleeeeect... [end]
[start] Imagine not closing your tabs and instead having over 1000 tabs, making sure no tab-management firefox addon works due to the sheer number of tabs... [end]
[start] I let mine build up because "I am using", "I want to use", "I will come back to", or "I will be soon use" each one. Then one time I'll sit down to my computer and find Chrome has lost them all and I'll sigh a sigh of relief. [end]
[start] Thot. [end]
[start] 🤔I thought that you can only open 36 tabs on Google Chrome at a time.🤔 [end]
[start] This bitch assuming everyone is a programming asian nerd. Gtfo lmao, fuck a program. Go pop some more addy. [end]
[start] I open 100 chrome tabs when it is cold and I don’t want to turn the heater on [end]
[start] True! It’s that. [end]
[start] so true [end]
[start] >solving an obscure programming bug  That's a weird way to say that. [end]
[start] Come come I can't upvote this post. [end]
[start] I call bullshit! No one closes 100 chrome windows. It crashes way before 100. [end]
[start] This bitch is a virgin [end]
[start] Well, she is right. [end]
[start] Honestly she's entirely right based on my experience. [end]
[TITLE] Working at PornHub [TITLE]
[start] TFW your workplace is tagged *Not Safe For Work*. [end]
[start] I think it would be extremely impressive on your resume if you worked at PornHub in SRE or infrastructure. Having to handle those huge loads and all. [end]
[start] Smart move to call the parent company MindGeek. [end]
[start] I worked for a porn company years ago, essentially writing the software for their private jack off booths.  I was a sole developer and left to help build my career but that was a bad move in hindsight. The hours were great, the work was interesting enough and it is by far the most chilled industry I've ever worked in, having a joint with morning tea was quite common. [end]
[start] Honestly, though, it would be a good job to have on a resume. Mostly in terms of technical skills. Dealing with the volume of traffic they deal with would be extremely valuable in terms of building up knowledge. Some employers would frown upon it, for sure, but if you frame it as "Hey, I make the 22nd largest site in the world work.", it probably looks really good from a technical perspective. [end]
[start] I'd like to work there. The few people I know that works there are pretty cool and It's close to where I live. (MindGeek, it's not called pornhub as far as I know.) [end]
[start] **P**orn**H**ub **P**rogramming [end]
[start] php stands for: programmers hate php [end]
[start] Decades ago, I almost took a job for the summer. I would have been paid to upload porn images to their Usenet newsgroup. Despite being your typical raging hormone teenager at the time, I decided against it because, in part, I wasn't sure how it would have looked on my resume. [end]
[start] Pornhub has an office in my city 🤔 [end]
[start] Can I work on Backend please? [end]
[start] Now I feel dirtier knowing I fapped to something written in PHP [end]
[start] When I was younger, I received an invitation to interview at Mr. Skin as web developer.  For those that don't know, Mr. Skin finds when actresses are nude in movies and provide time stamps and descriptions of the scene.  I was unemployed at the time, so I briefly considered replying...until I thought about how I would tell my then 81 year old grandmother what I would be doing.   [end]
[start] Hey, uhh a *friend* told me that PHP development is really quick, so that’s why *my friend* is a PHP dev. How wacky is that? [end]

[start] Whats wrong with PHP? [end]
[start] Missed opportunity. He should have said, "I'm interested, but I'm more of a back-end man." [end]
[start] PornHub now has videos that sync with connected sex toys. I would like to have to job of recording the "ins" and "outs" of the video. [end]
[start] I'd love to sit in on a product manager meeting at PornHub.  "Our viewership is up approximately 3% after the introduction of simulated pterodactyl rape porn!" [end]
[start] PHP = PornHubPHP ? [end]
[start] php is the bomb, I'm not sure where everyone gets bad rep for it...   just look at symfony/laravel/codeigniter... I mean try it your self... sure php 10 years ago sucked,  but come on, just look at the vast number of tools available to quickly develop and test with ease!    I run a company on a PHP application which handles roughly $20mil/year in payroll... obviously its not wordpress but its definitely not crap like everyone assumes. [end]
[start] For some reason I feel like a "front-end developer" at a porn site is a euphemism for a fluffer.  [end]
[start] well you could always get a job taking down videos that have been hit with a DMCA notice and putting them in the queue to be reposted by a 'random user' the very next day. [end]
[start] I AM NOT A COMPUTER PERSON. Could someone equate this to another scenario?  [end]
[start] I think I'd be more interested in working on the back-end ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) [end]
[start] I agree. That's what my girlfriend does. She just tells people she's a software engineer.  [end]
[start] I like php...  I mean what alternative would you recommend? And what are your reasons for it?  [end]
[start] Are they still hiring?  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I don't understand how anyone could work at place like that and still have pride in themselves. I mean, come on people, *Montreal*? [end]

[start] What’s the default IDE? Notepad?? [end]
[start] > our default IDE  *laughs in capitalism* [end]
[start] There are dozens of us! Dozens! [end]
[start] At least he wasn't using a light theme [end]
[start] I don't have stickers on my laptop or a mechanical keyboard. [end]
[start] What a monster. [end]
[start] I wear company swag, have stickers, have a mechanical keyboard, and use non-default IDE's. WTF have I become.... [end]
[start] That's someone who already has another job lined up. [end]
[start] Truth...  This is most developers.  Only a small, but vocal, prevent of people really feel passionately about programming.  Usually it fades after a few years.  I have fifteen years of Dev experience.  Team lead, manager, senior dev, dev, whatever.  I would rather come home and play with my kids than learn yet another ui framework, or learn a new way to.... Write multithreaded code.  Ugh.  I wear the clothes because I get them for free.  I put the stickers on because it is works laptop, and they encourage me to do so.  At work, in person, during an interview,I will lie and tell you I love learning.  That I love new tech.  It's lies.  I want to get paid.  If I can feel good about my company or job woke I do it, even better. [end]
[start] Must be a new hire. [end]
[start] Like a normal developer [end]
[start] jokes aside, if you bring a mechanical keyboard into a starbucks, you're the worst kind of person.  I feel like half an asshole just using one at home in my apartment. [end]
[start] Either a rare sighting or a hoax. I want pics in future reposts [end]
[start] This joke again? [end]
[start] Even worse, just bash, tmux and vim. [end]
[start] I don't get mechanical keyboards. Too much noise, too much effort to press the keys. [end]
[start] Must be a real software engineer and not on of these new script kiddies [end]
[start] Not an engineer or programmer but i like stickers on my laptop :( [end]
[start] Lieees [end]
[start] Why you fucking lyin. [end]
[start] It me. [end]
[start] Default IDE = light theme?! [end]
[start] Is this an American programmer thing? Can people from other countries comment on the hoodie / sticker thing?  Aussie here, never seen it [end]
[start] I bring my mechanical keyboard to work and not a day goes by where I don’t hear people complaining.   At least management knows I’m being productive. [end]
[start] In my experience, most developers don't have stickers on their laptop or were company swag,  but do use mechanical keyboards, (why wouldn't you they feel so much better) and very few people use the default editor if they can avoid it. [end]
[start] Stickers on your laptop means you a graphic designer. Not an engineer [end]
[start] default IDE? What's your default? [end]
[start] I checked out years ago man. [end]
[start] Does it count if I wear a hoodie for a company I used to work for to my current job? [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked.  Company shirt, laptop stickers, and mechanical keyboard. Check, check, and check. [end]
[start] no stickers ? isnit even a laptop then ? [end]
[start] This is me, but I'm only a system engineer.  I'm too cheap to buy a mechanical keyboard. [end]
[start] Default IDE!? How dare he [end]
[start] I’ve seen this power only once before [end]
[start] dinosaur engineer [end]
[start] No mechanical keyboard?  That's not psychopathy, that's masochism. [end]
[start] They had us in the first half, not gonna lie [end]

[start] What do you mean by "end"? [end]
[start] Missing the third picture where you transcend time and space, becoming aware of all bugs, faults, optimizations, yet time constrains you into becoming a chaotic neutral God fully aware of the costs to implement such changes, and understanding of what humans truly want which is more, not better.

[start] What is this "end" of which you speak? [end]
[start] Yep, been there. Was on a project for 9 months, total shitshow. They hired 3 firms to deliver different parts of the system. We continuously cannibalized the other team's work, eventually getting 100% of the project. We get to 2 weeks before go live and the dipshit overpromoted embodiment of WMP shows it to the execs for the first time. They say "wtf is this?!," Because he hadn't even bothered to get their nod or opinion on a hundred dev effort. Which is, of course their way of excusing themselves from not having looked at his department for a solid year and not knowing where $50M was going. And guess who was out on their ass (hint, not the tub of lard who couldn't write a line of code, or the geriatrics he reported to). [end]

[start] I blame the schools. [end]
[start] At any given moment half of all the developers are in this boat it seems. [end]
[start] I feel this. We go to staging in about 2 months.  We're not close to ready.  [end]
[start] Seriously, what is the context for the pic of him in a bathrobe and bear slippers holding guns? Is it a movie or something or was he chasing paparazzi?  [end]
[start] 6 months? 6 *months*?? What are all these 6 month projects? I'm in my 6th year of a PhD... The same gd code base, same algorithm... 6 years...  [end]
[start] Oh, I love this so much,. [end]
[start] This is the greatest meme I've ever seen and I'm a security guard.  [end]

[start] Master has given dobby a glock! [end]
[start] If its a start up they're flipped [end]
[start] Not a developer myself. But I was doing a personal project of slapping together stuff from KDE Plasma with some shit from Gnome 3 and LXDE to combine my favorite bits from all of these desktop environments. And this was me when they all updated at once right before I had it perfectly how I was wanting it and those updates broke everything and started causing kernel panics for some fucking reason.  [end]
[start] you can thank Steve 'sweaty palms' balmer for this one folks [end]
[start] Swear to FSM getting and then meeting requiremenrs is by far the hardest part of programming [end]
[start] What  do you mean the end of a project? [end]
[start] Could also be a comparison between book-canon vs twitter-canon. [end]
[start] O: new meme format 👏  -pewdiepie  //subsribe to him. he deserves it\\ [end]
[start] XD, the same can be probably said for some fans of some games too. (long awaited games) [end]

[start] I've just been hired to work on a 3 year old project being "transitioned" over to my company by another we contracted to failed our 1 year deadline.  It takes 5 minutes to compile.     They don't use DLLs.     There are over 500,000 classes in this project.     This was meant to be a small spinoff game for a thing. Now I have to make it work, because it doesn't right now. And my company it desparate to make this game work.     So, I'm starting at the second here. Please bless, I don't know how much worse I'll look after a year of this.    [end]
[start] I have a "project" at my hands where the PL said he thinks it will be done in 3 months. I told him that's not going to happen, made him a plan from what I  saw (then!)  is needed on our team side and how much time that will take and that alone was over three months. It turned out it needed as much, roughly. However, with the implications for other teams (which I knew will exist but couldn't nor wouldn't estimate, it's not my business over there; I wrote as much in my estimation and said it to the guy in person, several times) and changes in direction in the meantime, we are **two years in** and there's no end in sight. It's not that there's no progress not that it's not working, it's that nobody wanted to acknowledge the matter complexity nor the organizational one.  Fucking hate it... [end]
[start] Time can attack anythings. 😢 [end]
[start] That's their own fault for setting deadlines  [end]
[start] The slippers are the book from year one, with a foot down they're throats...  [end]

[start] Worked at a company where we were testing adhoc networking for a texting/speaking program. Basically kind of like walkie talkies with typing as an option.  This was tested by having 8 of us locked in a small conference room with a table that normally holds 6 chairs, with one wall being made entirely of glass, so that we were effectively in a fish tank made to be too small for us, that forced us to be able to see the break room and the main hallway to get out of the building, and everyone passing at all times of the day.  Someone brought us fish flakes.  People started drawing sea weed on the windows.  I think we all snapped a little.  I distinctly remember one day we were walking in circles around the table and started pressing our faces to the glass and following people that walked past. [end]
[start] Started a new project 3-4hours ago. I already can relate [end]

[start] Just wait until "Untitled Project - Copy" comes out [end]
[start] I feel attacked with Untitled Project [end]
[start] It was not my best app, but it gave me a chuckle when I was at ConsoleApplication420 😎 [end]
[start] Interviewer: Have you built any apps?  Me: I have a couple that are pretty famous, you may have heard of them. One's called "Hello World." [end]
[start] Bro how did you get my python projects folder  this is creepy [end]
[start] Cries in ConsoleApp1... [end]
[start] Funny I just explain to my youngest brother who is about to start college for programming what hello world is. I verbally explained him a few concepts. Just like anybody in my family would he went and signed up for 4 Udemy courses to finish before he goes to school to learn the exact same thing. My daughter cried the first day of kindergarten because she didn’t know how to read. This is the same situation all over again.   At least he is doing some good ones to cover a good base. C/C++, SQL concepts and programming, C# foundation and programming and Java and mobile development. [end]
[start] And then the icing of the cake of posting your pride and joy projects online.      git add --all     git commit -m "changes"     git push origin master [end]

[start] Hello World is objectively the best app.   1. It's verry smal jn size and can run on basicaly any computer.   2. Due to it's short source code it's easy to port it to other systems.   3. Extreemly high permormance due to verry short and efficient source code.   4. No bugs. [end]

[start] Don't forget "asdasdadasdas" [end]
[start] Don't forget ConsoleApplication47 [end]
[start] If yes developed those apps we'll all have to change the names of ours. I'm going with hello everybody. Like hello world but with a different interface, it worked for plenty of fish and OkCupid. [end]

[start] Untitled Project - 08-14-2020_back-3 [end]
[start] i never built and hello world app first thing i created was a programe to manage my collage records in c# and in php i build a half social media website and stoped hahha and in kotlen i am at the start so i only built two til now one is note that you put series you watch and in wich episode you are in and the other one is a small youtube for kids you can set in it a specific youtube channal and lock it and it will show ther videos to you and that may be usefull in keep your child safe from some chanal so ididnt build any hello worl til now unfortunately [end]
[start] I am working on an app which keeps track of all Hello world applications I have written and will be writing in foreseeable future. [end]
[start] Haha [end]
[start] I don't have any untitled app, but instead several called ass, poo and butt. It gives me a chuckle [end]
[start] Jghjghjghjhhh for me :) [end]
[start] I like to think that python developers get really confused at people saying Hello World is a useful first program to make. [end]
[start] I have connect four and calculator also qmong my best apps [end]
[start] That’s _quite_ a resume you just wrote out.  Your bro will be dope at whatever he enjoys doing or finds interesting (programming/it/software or not). People don’t like having programming foisted on them all the time; just ask my girlfriend.   I stand by math being lit btw. [end]
[start] TestApp1 [end]
[start] UnitTestProject1 says hi [end]
[start] Well i developed SYNTAX ERROR.  So Take THAT [end]
[start] Untitled Project is nowhere as good as Asdfasdaf but otherwise I agree. [end]
[start] everybody gangsta til the untitled project can finally solve 2+2 without any syntax errors [end]
[start] New Project... [end]
[start] $ Git status  + index.html.swp [end]
[start] Plus they all work smoothly [end]
[start] I have a GTK App. Good to know. When I try stuff or just want to figure out how something specific works, I do it there. It's just a bunch of unit tests, but I think it helps me a lot. [end]
[start] I started learning django and I made a project called "testsite". Long story short now it's an actual website. [end]
[start] Mine is "Copy of New Project (1)" [end]
[start] Been there done that [end]
[start] i mainly start at #2, or #3 saved on the desktop if its gotta be mega fast stuff. [end]
[start] best song I ever made on FLStudio 20 - khhjjdggdd.flp [end]
[start] That list is probably sorted by bug_count ascending. Try sorting desc by customer, active users, or features instead. Or turnover, or profit. Hell, even dev hours spent or LOC are better metrics to show off. [end]

[start] I made the main app. [end]
[start] And the next day pycharm says interpreter not defined for the project. I quit. [end]
[start] My game’s file’s is literally "library" + test and never changed it since [end]
[start] Ha. Noob. You forgot Test App1 [end]
[start] Do you wanna develop an app? [end]
[start] God damn, that is exactly how I have my programming directories. [end]
[start] one time I made a calculator app following a YouTube video [end]
[start] My best was that, but with a loop [end]
[start] How do I submit an app idea [end]
[start] the three this i have developed 1.pornhub 2.brazzers 3.cornhub [end]
[start] Yes I agree [end]
[start] It becomes even more true when you start working as a programmer, goddamn some of those projects are nasty. Three quarters of the time I'm making a mental note of whoever did the initial commit. [end]
[start] This is standard and was for me for about 6 months AFTER feeling proficient in my first language lol [end]
[start] Me: Oh, I will make a front end in this new technology so that I can reuse the same REST API backend again. Also dockerized because why not.  Useless projects but you know, good for practicing [end]
[start] "Playground" [end]
[start]  Keep  it  , good [end]
[start] ConsoleProject15 runs a fairly substantial piece of our infrastructure. [end]
[start] WindowsFormsApplication32 has to be my best work so far. [end]
[start] 4. New project [end]
[start] Damn even I got that far in Qbasic [end]
[start] the last thing I deployed in production on my job is pretty much a node.js / bootstrap-vue version of hello world [end]
[start] Sounds like these 3 apps are bug free so in fact these are your best apps. [end]
[start] Atleast has it works [end]
[start] At least I have ConsoleApp, ConsoleApp2, ConsoleApp3, ... [end]
[start] Forgot to add “Create React App”  I’ve seen at least 3 resumes where they mention a front-end project and the link just brings you to a forked version of that repo [end]
[start] Dont forget Aaaaa [end]
[start] Ahh. Untitled Project. Always seems to be open on Ableton. [end]
[start] Test, Test2, Test3, Test4, are some of my personal best [end]
[start] You're going places, kiddo \*gun gesture click\* [end]
[start] This cuts deep for a novice programmer who quit after getting the code wrong so it wouldn’t compile. [end]
[start] Don't forget MyAwesomeReactProject [end]
[start] Funny thing, that the executable for game ARK: Survival Evolved is still called ShooterGame.exe lol [end]
[start] In the process of making a workout tracker app. It's really basic but it works. 😂 [end]
[start] I feel so attacked right now that I'm having you charged with attempted murder... [end]
[start] Dont forget asdasd and qwerty [end]
[start] You love to see some World Trigger love [end]
[start] Todolist yo [end]
[start] 100% me when I decide I want to learn a new language then realize I really don't have the motivation for that [end]
[start] “Final backup final” is my proudest one [end]
[start] Sounds like my Angular journey. [end]
[start] I made a pretty nice index.php the other day [end]
[start] And index.html is the best web page I developed 😂 [end]
[start] 🤣 [end]
[start] BeforeIFuckeverthingUp.py and afterIfuckedEvethingUp.py are my jam [end]
[start] I understood that refrence. ! [end]
[start] don't forget 'Unitled Project (1)' and 'adkfhvknozlkenf' [end]

[start] Seems like you're ready for a management position! [end]
[start] Hey, start getting into parallel processing and you can make a word count app! [end]
[start] Those are also the best of my KSP ships! [end]
[start] Really true! [end]
[start] I used to be like you, until the other day when I added Untitled Project_V2 to the mix [end]
[start] Hello I am the evilest person alive [end]
[start] Hello world is my favorite [end]
[start] As someone with a computer science degree who just uses excel all day at work, I can't upvote this enough. [end]
[start] There is a guy at my work who makes these little helper apps. Sadly, they are all Untitled Project. They are always one big Function with questionable logic and redundant code. He never asks me for help even though he knows I can. He always says "I just need it to work. Nothing fancy." [end]
[start] New Unity Project [end]
[start] Frankly, these are all the best apps [end]
[start] You guys don't have hundreds of solutions scattered around named "Sandbox"? [end]
[start] This checks out. Passes QA test #1 [end]
[start] My man really going places with this [end]
[start] I have also developed   untiteled project(2)  Test 2  Test 3  Test 4  Hykavduguq [end]

[start] Hello world! Programmed to work and not to feeeeeel [end]
[start] First steps :D [end]
[start] I just roll number 1 and 2 into one app called "Curiousity", which unfortunately has a title [end]
[start] Have you met My App? [end]
[start] Lmao what a scrub. Did not even get to Asd and of course Dsa [end]
[start] Ngl, some of my more important projects are forks of my 'test app' [end]
[start] My personal favorites are ConsoleApp1 and ConsoleApp2.  ConsoleApp3 will be released Fall 2020 [end]
[start] my test app just has old test code commented out and the latest actual code is converting a milliseconds string to datetime object and output on console. first time knowing people use milliseconds instead of yyyy mm dd stuff. i'm looking at you devs making apps/services for unix systems. [end]
[start] My personal favorite is Untitled (89)  Or was it Untitled (604)?  Oh no [end]
[start] Don't forget "React App"! [end]

[start] The best onepager i've ever made: index.html [end]
[start] Me too! [end]
[start] Accidentally made my test all into production, called "webapi". Yeah no shit. Ahh. Oh well. Too afraid to rename and break something somewhere. [end]
[start] Good enough for me to go on a resume. [end]
[start] How can I get invested in “Untitled Project”? [end]
[start] ConsoleApp1 anyone? [end]
[start] Newapp.py followed by newapp2.py and so forth. [end]
[start] Me: 1. HELLO WORLD 2. HELLO WORLD 3. HELLO WORLD [end]
[start] I guess you never heard of my "Do you have a small Penis" app? I invented it 25 years ago when I coded first time in Borland Delphi.  I always use it as an example when ever trying out a new UI library or developing an app with UI in a language I've never used before. It has a label with the question, and two buttons labeled with "Yes" and "No" and, depending on my mood, switches out the labels or locations of the buttons whenever the mouse hovers over the "No" button. If I am in a very good mood I go the extra mile and even consider keyboard navigation. [end]

[start] If your baby BLJs while inside of the womb, it can build up PU speed, clip out of the womb, and skip all the way to high school. This used to only be possible in a TAS, but there are some new strategies that only require a couple frame perfect inputs. [end]
[start] Doesn't matter, they'll still need a loan to pay for college. [end]

[start] Tried it, baby's still broke as fuck and my wife thinks I'm more of an idiot than she did yesterday. [end]

[start] Imagine doing this to a 64bit system where the max (signed) value is:  9,223,372,036,854,775,807 [end]
[start] Imagine that actually worked, and then you’re stuck paying taxes on that amount.. [end]
[start] Back in the 90s I played a BBS door game called Legend Of The Red Dragon.  There was a poorly written module that allowed you to bet negative money, so you could just keep betting until you lost. I always gambled  2 billion less than I had, so when I lost it would subtract negative 2bil from my money. [end]
[start] so this Reddit post is a tweet with a discord screenshot, huh... [end]
[start] Honest to God there's a straw man theory out there that's not that far off from this. In a previous customer facing job I had the unfortunate pleasure to deal with a guy who thought he could buy his social security number back from us so he could cancel all his debts. [end]
[start] How do your social security numbers work? How does that relate to immediate personal capital? [end]

I'm lost looking at the specs, so what matters more in this case, the 7 bit interface, or the variable length strings?  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM\_700/7000\_series#Commercial\_architecture\_(702/705/7080)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_700/7000_series#Commercial_architecture_(702/705/7080))  Edit: Bonus [705 Tube porn](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ipKoiZOGOLg/WlBzkyeLcOI/AAAAAAABH-4/8UQMU70xMuQdjl7JquLt0mVQFjXgUtIIACHMYBhgL/w9999/module-front.jpg) [end]
[start] That's not how it works. 0 -1 as int won't loop around. 2147... (e.g. 2^31 -1) is the max of a signed int. Signed int under/overflow is generally undefined. Signed uint underflow loops back around to 4294... (e.g. 2^32 -1). [end]
[start] I can tell you from experience that the system handles negative money. Having negative money is actually the majority use case :( [end]
[start] Or your baby will start with $1 of debt. [end]
[start] Too european for this someone explein [end]
[start] Their* [end]
[start] Actually uses a 64bit number and profit. [end]
[start] Baby overflow [end]
[start] Wont work in COBOL(SSA uses a mainframe). [end]
[start] Tell my student loans that people's value is unsigned :c.  Maybe in a decade I'll have a positive net worth.  Oh wait no, the mortgage.  Maybe when I'm dead. [end]
[start] Im tell my mom to do this to my brother in a month when he is born [end]
[start] Thats uhh not actually how an int works [end]
[start] Is that why that’s the max cash stack in OSRS? [end]
[start] Now enjoy taxes on that 2b$ [end]
[start] My baby is due Monday, set yourself a reminder I'll post results! [end]
[start] Surely a government agency wouldn't be this incompetent...  Right? [end]
[start] What logic/lines of code make it take an error like that and try to correct it by switching to the largest 32 bit integer? [end]
[start] "the discord" [end]
[start] Someone's been playing too much Civilization and trying to pull off the Gandhi bug in real life. [end]
[start] [This is what Soverign Citizens actually believe] [end]
[start] TIL why the osrs max cash stack is the way it is [end]
[start] Ah yes, max cash at spawn [end]
[start] This mother fucker doesn't think a person can have negative value.  It's definitely a signed integer. [end]
[start] Even better if it's a 64 bit system woohoo 💰 [end]
[start] I came here (way too late) to talk IEEE 32 bit floating point standard. So proud of all my fellow nerds that beat me here [end]
[start] How does your social security related to money? [end]
[start] Y'all are assuming the government tax systems count in dollars... surely it would be in cents? [end]
[start] lets all do this [end]
[start] Or maybe that was an excuse so he wouldn't be put behind bars [end]
[start] No, it would just say "not enough funds to withdraw $1" [end]
[start] Just take 0.99 dollars over and over again and you've infinite money. [end]
[start] That guy speedruns [end]
[start] What if it's a 64 bit unsigned integer? [end]
[start] Tfw they use long instead of int64 [end]
[start] Someone is sleeping on the couch. [end]
[start] baby paying taxes before he even knows it [end]
[start] That how it worked in "Mafia" on the C64:  Go to the casino, bet -50.000.000 dollars, hope very much that you dont win.  Profit! [end]
[start] \* their value [end]
[start] Pretty sure a lot of people have negative balancrs [end]
[start] Yes, this is straight trash. [end]
[start] but you need 40 SS credits to be entitled to benefits, and in order to earn those credits you have to work and make money, so the value is just gonna wrap back around again [end]
[start] Ahhh, yes. The max GP stack. [end]
[start] Put offers in the grand exchange so it can have multiple cash stacks [end]
[start] Nothing prepared me more for that number than Old School Runescape. The baby would start with a max stack of gp!! Ez [end]
[start] Then if they earn a dollar it flips back around to zero [end]
[start] Someone on r/cursedcomments [end]
[start] Why when they get a social security number, their value resets?  Why am I asking this [end]
[start] That moment when Programmer Humour meets Sovereign Citizen… lol [end]
[start] Too bad   const startingValue = 0;  if (startingValue < 0) return; [end]
[start] MAX CASH STACK OUT OF LUMBRIDGE NO HACKS 100% NO CLICKBAIT [end]
[start] did.. you... just nuclear Gandi your baby? [end]
[start] holy sh*t! i never expected to see a negative integer overflow reference on r/programmerhumour of all places!  upvotes! upvotes all around! [end]
[start] Raising a child is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits. [end]
[start] So, it flips like an unsigned int, but the max value is that of a signed int... hmm... [end]
[start] that's a max cash stack! [end]
[start] Im curious in so many ways [end]
[start] Wait, that looks very familiar to RuneScape's coin cap [end]
[start] Are you seriously saying that the US cannot handle you being born with nothing but a hospital bill? [end]
[start] max cash [end]
[start] They'll have to spend it really quick or any value they make flips it over again [end]
[start] This is how tony stark became a billionaire [end]
[start] Granted. Now you owe hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and you get arrested for tax evasion, going to prison for the rest of your life. [end]
[start] I am very confused can someone please elaborate. [end]
[start] Did it actually work though? [end]
[start] Reminds me of that one pokemon red glitch where if you immediately fight a level five pidgey for something that has that same attck bonus, then take the exact right amount of steps and step pattern on your way to varidiean forest(without any additional encounters) then get into an encounter on the exact right tile in the forest you can catch a level -1 mew, which obviously doesnt work, so the game sets  it to level 100 as soon as you catch it [end]
[start] Your baby now owes taxes on that money. Good luck [end]
[start] https://xkcd.com/327/ [end]
[start] Brilliant! [end]
[start] This is the shit I come to Reddit for. [end]
[start] This is how superstition begins. In 350 years nobody will understand the joke, and think coders really believed giving a baby a dollar would promote wealth. [end]
[start] I didn't pay attention to the sub name and though I was in r/amibeingdetained for near half of that paragraph.   Boy am I glad I was wrong. [end]
[start] Give it a try yet. [end]
[start] Disclaimer: I am an idiot.   But isn't this the same principle as why Gandhi loved to nuke you in Civilization? [end]
[start] This is what makes Gandhi angry. [end]

[start] You don't get far in life taking financial advice from people who can't tell the difference between their and they're. [end]
[start] Old School Runescape is leaking [end]
[start] Wait a damn minute... is this why runescapes max cash is 2.147B🤔 [end]
[start] and then sell him? [end]
[start] Not sure how that'd work in practice; balances are usually either a `float` or `double`, or (in a lot of gov't applications) a fixed point number (e.g., `DECIMAL(18, 2)` in SQL).  Neither of these have an underflow condition at 0. [end]
[start] They're. Eurrrrrrrrrgh [end]
[start] Infants cry at night in hopes that you don't have another one. Maybe they know something. [end]
[start] How do you give a baby a dollar [end]
[start] Plot Twist:  64bit system. Baby now owns all the money [end]
[start] Someone actually put it in your admissions analysis? [end]
[start] So the baby can pay the hospital bills and start fresh with 0 balance [end]
[start] Hopefully they are using unsigned long long ints... [end]
[start] Well boys, we did it. Poverty is no more. [end]
[start] But what if it is 64-bit? More moneeyy! [end]
[start] Someone posted a video on r/AntifascistsofReddit [end]
[start] All's good, but that "they're"... [end]
[start] Man, is this how the wealthy people do it? They must've had a kid for the government to give them more money. [end]
[start] Someone on r/mls until today. [end]
[start] In runescape the maximum cash stack size is 2.1B, but some people have managed to glitch their money to -2, which gave them unlimited money for some reason, maybe it’s the same irl [end]
[start] Who is this guy bored, or a pro?" [end]
[start] [Ah ok I think I like this comment. :) [end]
[start] I’ve had a negative net worth for years. No wonder the whole country is so messed up. [end]
[start] This made me laugh harder than ***Nuclear Gandhi*** did. [end]
[start] You could always just use Motherlode... [end]
[start] Only works if birth location is in the United States. [end]
[start] Someone explain America to me [end]
[start] omg yes [end]
[start] If only my student loans worked like this [end]
[start] Is this true? [end]
[start] Id love to start runescape with max cash [end]
[start] Oh Brother! 🤣 [end]
[start] Max cash stack [end]
[start] I've barley been on reddit over the last year and I'm glad I did. Why does there have to be this Twitter screenshot, it adds nothing of value. Just cut out the middle mad and just post the Discord screenshot, the actual content. In other words:  >padding: 0; [end]
[start] Perfect [end]
[start] i wish my parents did this [end]
[start] Wait so what do people like bill gates do who have like 9 billion dollars [end]
[start] Reminds me of RuneScape max currency amount! [end]
[start] Damn I wish there was a 32 bit integer wealth cap in this country... [end]
[start] This would not work for so many reasons [end]

[start] Imagine not knowing the difference between there/their/they’re. [end]
[TITLE] We've all been there [TITLE]
[start] I would always tell the sales staff that they succeeded because I turned their lies into truth. And of course for all their bullshitting, I had to stress about how to make it happen and they got paid better. [end]
[start] Yep [reminds me of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg).    When it came out years ago I was stunned at how accurate it was.   The more I showed it to people, I then became stunned at how pervasive it is!!  People in all different types of jobs across all different areas could relate. [end]

[start] Reminds me of a hospital system in the uk called [Lorenzo](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nhs-lorenzo-it-patient-records-blunder_uk_5b9f7c33e4b04d32ebfa268e).  The story was that when it was presented to the government it was nothing more than a slick PowerPoint.  And the went for it.  Edit: Link [end]
[start] Dilbert, 19940220  "It has to have a 45 inch screen and still fit in a purse or a wallet. It needs to act as a communications satellite, as well as a room freshener.

[start] I've been in situations like that. Feature-wise we could do it, but time-wise we couldn't. The salesperson was selling something that should take us 10 months. He sold it as a solution we would have ready for production in 4 months.  So there I am. The senior engineer who did his due diligence, the research, the planning. I sat with the project manager (who was also present and didn't say anything) and created the whole line of stories: all the epics and most stories.  We knew it wasn't going to happen.  So I took him aside and told him:  "We need 10 months, not 4."  He told me he knew what he was doing. I told him I knew what he was doing, too. And it's not going over my back. I'm not going to work endless amounts of overtime because he's eager to score a big fish.  So I told him:  "It's not going over my back. I'm not going to have my team work endless amounts of overtime because you are eager to score a big fish."  And I continued:  "You do your sales, I'll excuse myself and email our CTO and CEO about this."  We did not get the client because a different contractor did. They underdelivered. And six months later we were called in and we signed a preferred provider contract. That was five years ago and we're still working with them.  \---  Edit: That salesperson still works for us and he's improved since :) [end]
[start] "Hey team, just got off a meeting with the clients. Told them you guys can do XYZ as a special exception for them, you guys can right?"  everyone looks at each before one of us says "uh... no?"  awkward silence, as the person from product looks at us worriedly before finally our team lead says "I guess we can try"  and that's the story of how my team kept having special exceptions for every client ever [end]
[start] Joke  Q: What's the difference between a car sales rep and computer sales rep?  A: The car sales rep knows when they are lying. [end]
[start] I kind of have the opposite issue. Sales are underselling our solution currently because there are a lot of competitors. Our one is unique to our system and is optimized for that workflow and none of the others has that kind of functionality. Sales have been caving and allowing competitor products to be used instead of the one they have. It sucks. [end]
[start] at least you're in the room. account will just come in and tell us they sold this insane product to the client, and then we have to go "How the fuck can we give them that with 3 grand budget" [end]
[start] Why impossible? Geometry? Just ignore it! [end]
[start] Egineering ain't as easy as the sales team think lol [end]
[start] Internal meeting: "We can get that project done in a year."  Sales: "How's Thursday sound?" [end]
[start] Or just embellishing the talents and delivery of the Devs.   I'll never forget the time I was in a product demo and one of the managers told the customer "we now have a fully automated pipeline" and I was just there like "oh god oh no" because I was the one that did a tremendous amount of work on the pipeline that I was proud of, but never would I call it "fully automated". [end]
[start] Sales - "Yes, yes Mr Customer, here's how we detect an infinite loop." Engineer -"Hey, listen to me. It's the halting problem. There's no solution....." Sales - "Ahaaagagahavagaaggagsgsgsgsgahahahahshhdhd, I'm sorry, so we were saying, we'll get it done. You can trust us..." [end]
[start] Client based web development has been a  boom recently, however it can lead to a lot of extra hours, and general unhappiness (caused by the metaphor in this meme). Source:  have been in this field now for 6+ years. [end]
[start] Even in high school it’s like this.   Group: presents really cool project idea  Teacher:likes it  *two weeks pass*  Group: staying up at 2 am trying to salvage it realizing some of the parts are literally impossible to do without messing up some other part of the project. [end]
[start] The next picture is likely to be the sale team whipping the dev team to create the solution faster [end]
[start] As a sales engineer for software, this is too hilarious 😂😂😂 [end]
[start] Sales invites the junior developper to a meeting saying it's a simple meeting with a new client.  Sales: So we made an AI that can predict the future, read minds, and makes all your wishes come true. Isn't that right?  Junior Dev: What...Eh... well...  Sales: \*\*\* \[Intense glare\] \*\*\*  Junior Dev: Well with enough resources and time, maybe yes...  Sales: Great! Meetings over. Are you interested for us to sell it to you that at a ridiculously low amount so I can collect a commission on it and have it done next week? [end]
[start] More like technical possible, but for 5x the budget the sales team is pitching and 10x the development time. [end]
[start] Was once told to sit in a meeting & not to say anything working for a US military contractor. The meeting was with the people in charge of our funding & the specs they'd given for the project they wanted done were not remotely efficient, given that we'd already built a prototype & the rewrite they wanted to be compatible with their steaming pile of 20+ year-old shitcode would have been better spent making their old-ass spaghetti code (that didn't even run, for mysterious reasons, on certain machines) compatible with our fresh, clean, solid prototype. But the taxpayer money tree needs a good shaking down, and my boss was intent on leaving our military customers in the dark about wasting their (and our) time & more of their money on outmoded tech so long as they paid. [end]
[start] This is my life [end]
[start] Implement sociopath antidotes. Keep a secret journal, if anyone finds out about the Journal before it's locked up in your lawyer's office, it's gone. Everything that marketing says, especially if it's false, record in the journal. [end]
[start] My trick is to never say "no, it's impossible". Because in the product manager's mind equates to "he doesn't know, he just has to sit down and think, and he will do its magic".   Instead, give a ridicolus, yet precise, estimate. Something along "Yeah... We could do that. With an estimated investment of 10-15 people, all of them with higher education, post-doc obviously, and it would require an (optimistic) 5 years of full time work". Something that you know they will not be able to approve, like ever.   Than you look the sales people and say "And you sold this thing to the clients for... 1000€ more?"   Finally, you look the PM. You let him make the calculations in his mind - calculations you already know where it will lead. You let him figure it out WHY the sales team should talk with engineering before promising ANYTHING. [end]
[start] Anything is possible with enough time and money. That's the proper reply. [end]
[start] I filmed a commercial for a wheelchair company yesterday and my boss is telling the client he can do all this amazing editing and that the 10 min video shot all on green screen that’s mismatched in colors and has shadows cast everywhere can be fully edited by me (17yo and the only editor) by this Monday. And that the shadows are fine and I *won’t have to manually rotoscope every frame of a 10 min 60fps video* [end]
[start] I’m a presales engineer, so I’m a double traitor: I create custom solutions, demo it, and then hand it over to R&D... KNOWING THAT IT DOESNT WORK LIKE THAT. [end]
[start] Hey, stop following me around. [end]
[start] Both me. I'm the "Sales team" and the Engineering. Tho not really. I'm the only people that makes that game, therefore I'm both. [end]
[start] The hilarious part is as soon as the sale is made, the impossible is now your responsibility.  Sales will only ask for a status on the thing you told them before you couldn't do. [end]
[start] Template please! [end]
[start] More likely the engineering team is being muzzled because no way they can meet the timeline presented to the customer. [end]
[start] I am in controlling and I can assure you this happens even before engineering is concerned. At some point I stopped counting the instances where I kept myself from asking 'Why are you promising a feature which was descoped four months ago'? [end]
[start] Sales Team: It's a Unicorn!  Project Manager: It's a horse.  Devs: It's a pony on stilts. Still not 100% sure how it does it, but it does it. [end]

[start] Same shit dealing with sales people at a jewelry store. Karen, you should know a square peg won’t go in a round hole. [end]
[start] Petered out there at the end for Max salt [end]
[start] I encountered that this week! [end]
[start] This hits too close to home. [end]
[start] One of the sales guys at a company I used to work at once told me: "If we told the truth the company wouldn't have any customers". [end]
[start] Can we have another follow-up of the engineering team getting yelled at by the customer and trying to accomplish impossible promises that made it into the SOW?? [end]
[start] My defense against this is to look surprised, then ask if they are really invested to put in that much money and wait years for development when they could have something cheap and now. If sales lowballs the price ask them if they got authorization to spend that kind of money. [end]
[start] The joys of being both the product manager, a developer, and the engineering manager: I am my own sales team and I only commit to things after they're done. [end]

[start] A teammate and I have tried solving an issue in powerbi for the last couple weeks. Everything we found online said "nope, not doable." We asked our team expert who gave us the typical online response which doesn't work.  In a meeting with a few higher ups, the project manager told them that I was working on that issue and would solve it.  Q.Q [end]
[start] Being a sales engineer thinking “wtf are you saying” or even learning about a new product of ours in an executive meeting at a large payments firm. Smh. [end]
[start] So, that pic is a person trying to pass a normal dog as a service dog. Because if it barks for no reason, it's not likely a service animal and they'll be kicked out. [end]
[start] My lead presenting our progress to the other teams   Me knowing none of it is technically true   Everyone clapping [end]
[start] This is so true. I used to be the app engr who traveled with the sales guys.  I said I would not try to audibly gasp whenever they said our system could do something it could not. [end]
[start] This looks like a prime plot for a Dilbert panel. [end]
[start] Engineer here.  Our sales team once sold a customer on a custom project, and agreed on a feature that would save a decent chunk of change.  This feature was near impossible to machine, and by the time I had gotten the design completed and the machines coded (with about 60 lines of special code our programs wouldn't spit out automatically), they had lost the extra money saved by nearly twice the amount because of my overtime pay while working on this one project.  But, the customer, and sales team, are always right. [end]
[start] For me, it was just my project manager throwing out ideas in front of the client like they could be done in a few days. As soon as he said that, I pinged our SME and he was like "Yeah, idk wtf he was talking about, that would take more than a year to work out and he offered it to the client as if we'd have it done and in production next week." Luckily the client didn't take the bait since our PM was new and not trusted by that point. It's also why he's not trusted by the tech team still even though it's been almost a year. [end]
[start] "Our upcoming release will let the software LITERALLY READ YOUR MIND and do exactly what it is you need it to!" [end]
[start] "...and this chatbot will be able to answer any of the customer's technical questions, just like a real subject-matter expert..."  Right, Joe, we promised them we'd have it done in 6 weeks. [end]
[start] "We ant to make a banking app but without making any deals with banks so we dont have to pay any transaction fees" [end]
[start] Technically anything is possible. Just how much money do you want to spend? [end]
[start] Automotive sales here. This hits home too hard. Is egineering a spelling mistake or some inside joke I'm not getting? [end]
[start] Shits the same in construction [end]
[start] This is my boss and the only sales guy up front FOR SURE. Constantly selling shit we've never done and don't currently have the capability of doing. We could easily make another quarter to half million a year if they'd stop being idiots. [end]
[start] This is our fricken life. Sales promising the moon, and the engineers trying to figure out how to lasso it. [end]
[start] The fact that engineering is spelled wrong only makes this more acurate [end]
[start] Toooo true, haha. [end]
[start] Holy shit this format is great [end]
[start] far far too often.... [end]
[start] Not if you're an engineer with balls! [end]
[start] [So we're all egineers, eh?](https://v.redd.it/wd4dpu0wdc451) [end]
[start] This is why I'm not invited to meetings with the clients. I can't control my facial expressions. [end]
[start] Was sup RingCentral [end]
[start] I straddle the line. I am the sales engineer [end]
[start] Did someone say senior design project? [end]
[start] So true. [end]
[start] And it happen in so many jobs.. as a cleaner being forced to make it look like using a floor cleaning machine is the solution for the floor when there was never a problem in the first place doing it by hands... it's rage inducing. Especially when it make me lose time as a result and do a worst job instead.  But it make money and it's more important for some people that doing the job right. [end]
[start] That is the only way to make a sale. [end]
[start] my friend started out as a computer engineer and then transitioned into sales. he was so good at his job because he actually understood what the fuck the engineers did that his boss thought he was some sort of genius and basically made him the #2 at the company after like a year. apparently its very rare for engineers to become salespeople due to their shy personalities [end]
[start] When the Account Manager says: That should only take our design team a couple of hours! [end]
[start] I'm surprised the engineer was even brought to the presentation just because of this. [end]
[start] Yes we are dogs. [end]
[start] I am lucky to be at a company where the sales staff is our president, a programmer at heart. And the support staff is trained to say "I don't know if that's possible". [end]

[start] Depends on the company, I'm a technical consultant and don't have this issue with my salespeople. [end]
[start] Not a programmer but this is exactly how I feel at work when we make prototype products sometimes. [end]
[start] I remember my first full time job out of college, basically technical support for a small software company of about 30 employees and 100-150 clients.  I got to tag along on a dinner we took a high profile client out to with the CEO and a few of the sales guys because I had a previous relationship with both them and the client.  I remember hearing the CEO talking to the client about features of the software, some I wasn't familiar with, and must have missed the point where he clearly started going off script and started riffing about new features that he was basically just thinking up on the spot to sell the clients on.  I didn't realize it till after dinner in the parking lot, one of the sales guys was on the phone with the head developer relaying what the CEO was selling.  Not on speaker phone but I heard him yell "He told them we could do WHAT?!?!" from about 15 feet away. [end]
[start] Trying to explain to execs that the data doesn't support their idea be like this. [end]
[start] Oh god worst job I ever had was this small MSP who basically sold a bunch of projects to customers when they had no idea what they were doing.  I was hired to be the Help Desk manager but from day one it was "hey we sold this it doesn't work you said you know this can you fix it today, thanks there's zero documentation by the way".  I quit after three weeks. [end]
[start] I have been here many times in the last few months. My new job is a bit of a nightmare. Boss who knows absolutely nothing about what he is taking about commits to all these fantastical things after doing a quick Google search for "can X do Y" and then explains to his boss or a customer in literal star trek technobabble about how it'll work and shit. Then when I try to bring the conversation back to reality in private he pulls up the 10 seconds worth of googling he did so that he can look at you and say "just fucking Google it man!" And shove you out the door. [end]
[start] Reminded me of this comedy sketch. We have all been in meetings like this.  https://youtu.be/BKorP55Aqvg [end]
[start] We've come a long way [end]
[start] Just fire up the old turboencabulaor and make it happen. [end]
[start] What about main.js all the time [end]
[start] I'm definitely the sales team in this and I'm so sorry [end]
[start] Anyone got the meme template? [end]
[start] He may have been more satisfying. [end]
[start] What about main.js all the time [end]
[start] At our company the CEO has sold investors a dream that is technically impossible. It will never ever come true or come even close to true. But what to do? When you tell the ceo that His great plan is never going to work because of him misunderstanding  thing 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, he doesnt care.  Defrauding investors is the name of the game. [end]
[start] Good ol paperware! [end]
[start] As an SE I resent this....no no he’s got a point [end]

[start] Our true success with all the ws [end]
[start] Ok, why is it all open and whatnot? [end]
[start] My hopes have been dashed [end]
[start] I live this [end]
[start] I'm a carpenter/builder and this mirrors what architects and clients deals are like, not so much what can be done but for what budget. [end]
[start] "so a million users just means ten times the cost! We can deliver it in about the same time frame" [end]
[start] I really wish sales would get shut down more often with penalty.  If you lie to make a sale, you should be called out - depending on the client you might have to still now at least try and deliver what’s been asked for BUT you should at least be reprimanded and if it happens multiple times - fired.  It’s kind of insane that’s not how things go down [end]
[start] [Sales said yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWjcudK-2w) [end]
[start] It's amazing how this is true in every industry lol [end]
[start] this is why you don't bust your ass for them and just make something work. sure you may break a few dev practices but i feel like way too many devs get uptight about that stuff.  get shit done, sweep stuff under the rug, ship something that works.  worst case scenario you can't deliver what they want in time or you get fired...to which they REALLY won't be able to meet their promises then. [end]
[start] The trick is writing and selling your own software. Then you know exactly what's possible (within your skillset) and what you can promise to end-users.  That's what I have been doing. [end]
[start] With spelling like this it is humor for more than just programmers [end]
[start] We once had a sales guy sell a system where the gears didn’t mesh. These were the massive gears the go from a ships motors to the propellers.   He thought it could be fixed in software. [end]
[start] My hopes have been dashed [end]
[start] Sales team being praised and rewarded for inking the deal of the century, engineering being called monkeys for not repealing the laws of physics [end]
[start] My mum wanted me to make a spreadsheet for her work to use for keeping track of certain things, I did my best and told her the method to make it work, now, I could have made it so much easier to use if I was given the proper programs to do it, but her work and her insisted on it being done on their own version which lacked so many resources and then she just gets annoyed saying shit like “I just wanted a SIMPLE spreadsheet, WHY CANT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT”  Like fine go pay someone else just to get given the same thing I did for free. [end]
[start] Are we just going to ignore the misspelling of Engineering? [end]
[start] My job in one pic [end]
[start] at work we sell a product. a new customer wants a version of our product that requires literally sawing part of our product in half and selling them a finished "half" version. i hate it. engineering hates it. there isn't even a proper part number for what this "half" thing is and now the lead engineer is now trying to convince the customer to just buy a whole version   muther fucker why even say yes to the half version to begin with??  everyone who gets paid more than me is dumber than me and i hate it. [end]
[start] And then the delivery teams all quit...I hope [end]
[start] Can you just take a dog out to eat like that? [end]
[start] Everything's possible if you spend enough money. [end]
[start] > It's a helicopter and a boat at the same time and they'll cost $18.  fffuuuuuuuccck [end]
[start] That's what I hate about IT World. I'm currently also selling IT solutions, that exists only on white paper and / or showrooms.  The main engineer actually even endorse it. Although I've tested for myself and it's not working.  Because my customer will not call and complain, accuse of scamming etc the engineer, he will do it to me, as the point of contact. [end]
[start] Our sales team is bad at planning and manage to give us a huge amount of work a few weeks before a big event takes place. This event takes place yearly... [end]
[start] True [end]
[start] Is this why they require 5 years for junior positions, they want liars? [end]
[start] Sums up my internship [end]
[start] so many times [end]
[start] We already learn this at school.... [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] Firstly...... fuck you for misspelling 'engineering'. [end]
[start] Funnily enough we recently had one of our best sales reps sell a solution to a client, only to discover we don't even have it yet after trying to get a contract made.  Someone, somewhere had put it on a pricing list while the tech team still haven't started work on it. [end]
[start] What's the name of the meme? I need this to put another text on it :D [end]
[start] Fake it until you break it and run with the money before you get caught -theranos [end]
[start] For one reason I have that my code will work, I have 9 more that it won't. [end]
[start] It is true, I have been there. [end]
[start] Hehehe, Egineering. [end]
[start] Hate that this must happen often enough that there’s a meme.   I’m in B2b sales now and thankfully we don’t do this at my company. I’m not even allowed to sell my tool on the premise of a feature that isn’t already in product, even if it’s in development. Most people in this sub are likely familiar with my tools company and I’m proud to work there!   My sales engineer and I have actually become really good friends! Good enough we’ll be going camping together   Now when I was in insurance, my god the fraud was rampant. [end]
[start] Hey, everything is possible with enough time and money.  The issue is that engineers usually lack either one of them or both... [end]
[start] Wow.  This is wonderful. [end]
[start] Oh look it’s me this week. Again [end]
[start] If there’s one thing i learned at my internship it’s this [end]
[TITLE] Every Time [TITLE]
[start] The sad thing is that this works some of the time. [end]
[start] Let's remove some enters and  spaces in the code to make it cleaner and  run it again, did it often haha. [end]
[start] It works... better send this shit in before i test it and it doesn't work again  [end]
[start] No idea why it works...  No idea why it doesn't work..  [end]
[start] Sometimes you need to see the error occur in real-time again. That's my defense.  [end]
[start] "Maybe my recent changes didn't save"  We all know they did. [end]
[start] Have you tried changing to dark theme? [end]
[start] We all know that we actually delete/add a few line breaks, remove a comment or add spaces between expressions “just in case” [end]
[start] It's honestly more frustrating when it starts working. Like the god of programming has been toying with you this whole time, and now he's decided to make it spontaneously work to really twist the knife and cut your thin tether to sanity. [end]
[start] But it works sometimes, and that’s when you should be scared. [end]
[start] >runs code again  >different runtime error  >runs code again  >doesn't even compile  >runs code again  >works with no errors  Ah, ok, cool.  >runs code again  >doesn't even compile [end]
[start] Yo be fair, rerunning it is a perfectly acceptable thing to do. Sometimes your compiler will bug out. It was written by programmers too, so there are bound to be problems. [end]
[start] The real reason it didn’t work for em is because he is using a light theme.  [end]
[start] "Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact... same fucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change... That. Is. Crazy. " - Vaas [end]
[start] I once had to debug some code (back in ancient times, AKA 1990 or thereabouts) that worked fine 99% of the time but would crash randomly.   I eventually discovered a pattern. It would only crash between 10:00 and 1:00. On Wednesday’s. In September.   Hint: the code was written in C.  [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked [end]
[start] Or when I download an example file and it runs, but I write my own file copying the example line for line and it won't compile. [end]
[start] Actually, I'd say it's better to make sure that the error is consistent, before attempting a bug fix that might make the problem even worse if that happens to be the case. [end]
[start] Run, fail, run, fail, same place every time, reproducible, good, step through code, no error, run again in real time, no error.  Sadly mark bug as fixed and move on. [end]
[start] Relating so bad to this right now. Code that takes a string argument says "TypeError expected byte-like object, not str"  So covert it to bytes "expected str, not bytes"  Just sitting here clicking run hoping it works [end]
[start] Well with LaTex you have to compile it twice. [end]
[start] If your compiler is deterministic, where’s the fun in that?  [end]
[start] Did you try turning it off and back on?  [end]
[start] OP doesn't do parallel programming [end]
[start] Anyone else notice the MATLAB ide? [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] The sequel: My code finally runs, let’s run it 20 more times just to prove it runs. [end]
[start] When it works the first time but only the first time [end]
[start] Alternatively,  My code works  Let's change nothing and run it again  *everything breaks* [end]
[start] Just ask your coworker to watch you reproduce the bug. [end]
[start] 8% of the time it works every time [end]
[start]  Hey /u/kajri,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts. [end]
[start] This is sort of the equivalent to "Did you try shutting it down and turning it back on again " regarding the OS itself. [end]
[start] Obviously it’s a hardware problem [end]
[start] Just rebuild it a couple of times.  [end]
[start] Shit, now it's working.  [end]
[start] Surely it is the compiler that is mistaken! I shall give it a chance to correct itself. . [end]
[start] I work in VoIP and this shit is common. Sometimes we do have to make more than one attempt to get accurate results :p [end]
[start] Upvotes are coming in. Let's change nothing and post it again. [end]
[start] I am a very amateur (I mean very, python in the terminal level amateur) programmer, yet I can relate.   The funny thing is that this worked.  [end]
[start] Maybe it'll compile better this time [end]
[start] Valid method. Race conditions exist. The output of the program should not vary between runs, so let's try it again…and again…and again… [end]
[start] There was an engineer, manager and programmer driving down a steep mountain road. The brakes failed and the car careened down the road out of control. Half way down the driver managed to stop the car by running it against the embankment narrowing avoiding going over a cliff. They all got out, shaken by their narrow escape from death, but otherwise unharmed. The manager said "To fix this problem we need to organize a committee, have meetings, and through a process of continuous improvement, develop a solution." The engineer said "No that would take too long, and besides that method never worked before. I have my trusty pen knife here and will take apart the brake system, isolate the problem and correct it." The programmer said "I think you're both wrong! I think we should all push the car back up the hill and see if it happens again." [end]
[start] Debugging really does need a course of it's own.  [end]
[start] This will work literally 50% of the Time [end]
[start] So true in Python when I change nothing in code but 4 spaces and one tab to 8 spaces or 2 tabs [end]
[start] Still doesnt work... but now the error is completely different. [end]
[start] Is this weird? I’ll walk through the code a few more times to attempt to recreate the problem and see if I can figure out exactly where it fails before walking through it step by step [end]
[start] This logic stems from years of seeing OS issues being fixed by simply restarting the computer.  [end]
[start] The definition of insanity is trying something twice and giving up. [end]
[start] And if it doesn't, then u need to run it few more times, just in case. Around 10 is a healthy number before looking for a normal solution... [end]
[start] Let's change nothing and post it again.  [end]
[start] The 50th repost. please stop it. [end]
[start] And here I thought that I am the only one who does it... [end]
[start] This sub is fucking garbage. [end]
[start] I work in Powershell. This is what solves most of my issues.  [end]
[start] Latest error: "TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes".  I'll run it just one more time just to be sure... [end]
[start] I'm sometimes a bit paranoid in the opposite direction. I will write functioning code, then add some comments, then think "but what if my comments somehow messed up the code!?" so I have to run it again every time I add a comment to make sure it still works. Although I suppose that's not entirely nonsensical since there's always the chance you accidentally comment something out or make some other accidental change while writing the comments, so it might not be a bad practice. [end]
[start] Clean and rebuild [end]
[start] It working for Ionic shit  [end]
[start] Works with my Arduino, just sayin' [end]
[start] Well, that works when using live reload while working on front end... [end]
[start] The funniest thing is that not only the thing in the image, but also most of the ones in the comments, I actually do, typically thinking that I'm being dumb while doing them. I'm happy to see I'm not the only one. [end]
[start] The worst think is that it can sometimes work.. . [end]
[start] Sometimes I get a flash of anger/indignation on the rare occasion I'm REALLY VERY SURE I did the thing correctly. "Wait, what? No. Surely that can't be right. RUN IT AGAIN." [end]
[start] "...must be the compiler" [end]
[start] That clean build tho [end]
[start] That is the action of the lazy optimist. [end]
[start] Hmmm, that’s weird, it shouldn’t be working...what the hell??? [end]
[start] Well, it's easier than actually fixing the bug! [end]
[start] Try closing and re-opening your solution! [end]
[start] I swear, I've done this in VS and it has worked a couple of times [end]
[start] Did this just a few minutes ago when showing something to my boss. He looked at me like I was stupid but hey it worked. [end]
[start] Sometimes your code works and you have no idea how either.  [end]
[start] sh\*t why is this so true [end]
[start] I mean, if it's a concurrency thing, I will do this all day long lol [end]
[start] Too real.  [end]
[start] No, you got to change two or more things at once. That's the only way the problem will get fixed because the universe doesn't want you to know which thing fixed it. [end]
[start] "Can you crunch the numbers again?"   ..... "crunch" [end]
[start] Have you tried restarting your program without modification? [end]
[start] The just “flush again” method [end]
[start] Sometimes the ide don't save so this is perfectly reasonable  [end]
[start] but why does it actually work sometimes? that's some spooky shit right there. [end]
[start] plot twist: wrote multi-threaded code. [end]
[start] Let's run code formatting and see if that fixes it.  [end]
[start] It must be the compiler who is wrong. [end]
[start] Alternatively: "Let's try compiling this from source again with autotools and change absolutely nothing in the configure.ac or config.status file and wonder why GCC still won't compile my shit or why the configuration fails"  (Cross compiling for embedded systems is hell and I have suffered enough, I have a good reason to not actually think when working)  [end]
[start] 😂 [end]
[start] “Turn off than on” it’s no joke. [end]
[start] “...Run it again with success”  Fixed [end]
[start] Did save my code? Am I running the right file? Do I need to make clean????? [end]
[start] This method checks out and runs. [end]
[start] And then there's:  >My code works   >Let's change nothing and just watch it working correctly over and over again [end]
[start] It’s more of let’s change something that either does nothing or change something and then revert it and not realize that nothing was done in the end  [end]
[start] That is usually the point where I look at the clock, notice that it's 3 AM again and refuse to go to bed because "I'll just finish this real quick" [end]
[start] Have I ever told you... the definition of insanity?  [end]
[start] Now my code works. Let's change nothing and run it again.  Now my code doesn't work.  \*rinse and repeat\* [end]
[start] It works! [end]
[start] it work only with programming, interestingly some people try to use it in real world... [end]
[start] Just add a random # or % somewhere and it works like a charm [end]
[start] You must be able to duplicate the results. [end]
[start] Read the compiiler errors. Read the stack Trace. Restart visual studio.  [end]
[start] #flakytests [end]
[start] “Hmm, thats strange. It worked yesterday” is one of the most common phrases I tell myself preceding a two hour debugging session. [end]
[start] Hahaha! Coz you are coding like a pro :D [end]
[start] Is it me? No, it is the executable that is wrong! [end]
[start] Edge cases, Edge cases everywhere! [end]
[start] “You tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.”  \-Homer Simpson [end]
[start] its true) [end]
[start] And sometimes Works! [end]
[start] Valid argument, maybe you forgot to turned on the debugger [end]
[start] Always works. [end]
[start] Then it works and you're like "Ahah I knew it should work!" and commit and push. [end]
[start] Let's run it again on my local environnement where it works. [end]
[start] The first run was just priming the pump. [end]
[start] lets fix 2 things at the same time while fixing nothing and creating 4 new problems [end]
[start] I'll usually add a quick restart just for good measure.  The best is when Windows decides to update itself during your "quick" restart. [end]
[start] If it’s Ionic, this works most of the time  [end]
[start] Leap of faith.  [end]
[start] The sad thing is that this works some of the time. [end]
[start] It happens sometes with React Expo project when you run it. [end]
[start] It helps me with debugging, understand the problem more [end]
[start] you forgot a ; [end]
[start] I mean it's been working just fine for the last 6 hours. And I didn't touch anything. The odds are with me on this one. [end]
[start] skinner.jpg:. "No, it's the computer who is wrong". [end]
[start] for me it's always   1.)run for the first time "oh shit,an error"  2.) check the Red line in the code "this tells me nothing, what is going on"  3.) run it again to read the error message "yes I guess that makes sense" [end]
[start] ... mhm, i mean.. it works sometimes.. [end]
[start] The definition of insanity but I’ll do it any way [end]
[start] Clean and rebuild is the equivalent if turning it off and on again [end]
[start] That's just the nature of probabilistic phenomena. You can do deterministic coding if you want with the help of functional programming, but most people would rather go with loose causal structure, with a more free write-as-you-think approach. [end]
[start] OMG! You are working with with CSS and you just cleared Cache :D  [end]
[start] I mean, sometimes it's a race condition [end]
[start] Change nothing and release it. [end]
[start] Could someone eli5 how this could happen? [end]
[start] Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. [end]
[start] This happen when you are tired of programming . XD:) [end]
[start] This is me [end]
[start] Well, sometimes you change nothing in a working code and it stops working [end]
[start] *presses run* *fails* “hmm that didn’t work but what if I try this *presses run but crosses fingers* *works*  [end]
[start] You know it will not work yet you start it again  [end]

[start] What... The last thing I think of when I hear master is slave ownership lol [end]
[start] Crying in master degree [end]
[start] But Master has other connotations than slavemasters, right? Master & Apprentice, for example.  Edit for Clarification: I know the pairing in tech is specifically Master/Slave. My point in this comment was more to bring attention to alternatives like renaming the "Slave" part of the duality and keeping the widely standardized "Master". But I'm personally fine with the current change as well, as long as the language used is descriptive of the function. "Main" is perfectly fine, I have seen that being used in projects before.  To all my fellow Jedi Mains: I love you all :D [end]

[start] At my job we operate a large render farm for 3D/2d animation and we use a program called Deadline. We’ll Deadline ties several machines to the farm and when people aren’t rendering, you can “slave” their machine to the farm for faster throughput using the program “deadline slave”. Well sometime early this year we update the program and now it’s called “deadline worker”. We had a laugh because obviously the role of these machines aren’t any different so we started calling it “deadline indentured servant” or “deadline unpaid intern” [end]

[start] This is so stupid. You have to fix real life racism before fixing Github repos! [end]
[start] 2020 is the year that mostly white people on a righteous quest to rid themselves of their original sin decided that the fight for racial equality will mostly be about symbolic, ultimately meaningless gestures.  I remember how 20 years ago the civil rights movement was mostly about affirmative action, forced desegregation and reparations for descendants of former slaves and not about whether using the term negro or having the statue of a racist philanthropist is offensive or not. You can have an opinion on these matters, we all do. They often differ wildly even for entirely valid reasons. Nowadays however, there's hardly any public discourse about public policy, which would actually shape the future of young minorities. It's all about statues and words, policing behaviour to a minute detail and virtue signalling.  Being white, I'm not going to criticize the direction minorities choose to fight their battles, but I do hear a lot of minority leaders airing the anger over these issues and I deeply sympathize. I didn't invent the above reasoning, I chose to listen to some people who know a lot more about these matters than I do.   If I look at the bottom line, I don't think it matters that much if the main is no longer called master. To me, it's a minor inconvenience at most. What does bother me about it is that I feel that this is a distraction which doesn't help all those kids in disadvantaged households, in whose name this whole movement operates. Because we realised that fixing the actual problem is hard, we're focusing on those which are easy. [end]
[start] What the.. I understand that the issue is really bad, but shouldn’t people be focused on the real problem? I mean those “words” don’t relate to any human being. [end]
[start] Holy shit this is actually serious LOL [end]
[start] Probably also the reaction of my scrum master when I send him this meme [end]
[start] literally no-one associated 'master' on git with slavery though [end]

[start] Master is a title afforded to all male children in the UK (until puberty where they become Mr) [end]
[start] *DominantCard* [end]
[start] What a bullshit lol, the term comes from the Latin word for teacher, roughly, it was meant to designate when someone had reach a certain amount of expertise in his field to be considered worthy of teaching it to others, yes it was also used for a shorter period of time to define the master/slave in the us but if you ban a word because one of the many meaning it used to have then you give it much more importance than it had before [end]
[start] Let them first replace their brain [end]
[start] my privileged white 2 cents (i mean that with sincerity and empathy):  "master / slave" relations transcend just "white masters and black slaves". the American Civil War never even crossed my mind while programming master slave systems. but the Pyramids did. "master / slave" seems to describe a universal, inescapable Truth. it is beautiful language, it can be applied to anything. we are slaves to the system. we are slaves to our jobs. we're slaves to our families and political parties and egos.  it would seem a shame to ban such robust language, especially when it *doesn't invoke race at all*. (unless you have a very narrow and isolated understanding of slavery).  then, we have terms like "whitelist / blacklist", whose names seem to be derived from the ancient philosophical and religious meanings of "black and white".  one one hand, i understand how using "black and white" to describe "evil and good" is especially problematic in the current social climate.  on the other hand, if we rewrite "blacklist and whitelist" then we must force ourselves to re-asses all use cases of "black" or "white" to describe philosophical darkness and lightness. "black books", "black plagues". i don't even object to this, i just want us to be logically consistent in our decisions. and i'm kind afraid of the implications of changing such mythical language.  i can understand changing our language when it's become antiquated or potentially offensive or ignorant. but let's have real adult conversations about them. let's not pretend changing words is simple. let's not pretend changing words lacks consequence. let's not act like it's a one sided argument. and let's admit how masturbatory it is to act as if changing your git branch name is contributing to racial equality.  my company is currently in discussions to change it's master branch name, and i am quite sure the only reason the decision is unanimous is because anyone who doesn't agree is absolutely terrified to admit it. [end]
[start] Master doesn't always refer to master/slave. It can be Master and Apprentice. Are we forcing Darth Bane to rewrite the rule of two? [end]
[start] master/slave are technical terms that have been used in computing for decades. [end]
[start] This is fucking retarded. And with all the complexities of git repositories already, I simply can't see a local branch named master being pushed to GitHub who would then what? Display it as main? How the fuck would this work without fucking up your repo.  I've hated git blame for a while now and thought it should be more unbiased like git who but it's well ingrained and shouldn't really be changed at this point. Fuck Microsoft and their shitty politically correct decisions. [end]
[start] Same thing with chess players Grandmaster. [end]

[start] So if we’re going to remove offensive programming terms from github, can I still kill child with fork? [end]
[start] Ah yes, I’m well aware of the programmers who get turned on to white supremacy due to github terminology. Sad state of affairs [end]
[start] *Meanwhile people who are into bdsm*: Hold my whip and chains [end]
[start] Oh my fucking god do we really live in clown world? [end]
[start] This is so stupid I thought it was a joke. As if black programmers were feeling oppressed when pushing to master that make no sense. Maybe GitHub could hire more black people ? It seems more useful than this type of hypocritical show of support [end]
[start] This is a dumb decision but I’ve always liked the term trunk better since it’s more in line with all the tree metaphors. [end]
[start] What a silly world [end]
[start] So my Master Degree is racist now?  Waytogo on turning us against each other Microsoft/GitHub! I've historically supported such causes and this is even too much for me. [end]
[start] I would have thought programmers were smart enough to see past this virtue signaling... Computer programs are not oppressive and all this work is literally going to please maybe 1000 twitter nuts. Or, you just keep using Master/Slave terminology, since it makes perfect sense to describe the relationship between components. I work with servo drives and the slave does exactly what the master commands. Things like this are why no actual progress is made. Why doesn't github set up coding bootcamp for minorities or something actually useful? [end]
[start] Ah here we go again, exactly towards George Orwell's deepest fear. Replacing words, rewriting history. [end]

[start] In the professional photography world, lighting is key. To effectively light a subject, youll typically need lights from several different angles. Back in the day, all your lights were hard wired to a central box, lots of messy cables everywhere. Huge pain. Nowadays, we have wireless transmitters to remotely control our lights. Most modern lights either have a built in radio reciever, or need a little device that plugs in to the back of the light. Those devices are called slaves. [end]
[TITLE] All the software work "automagically" [TITLE]
[start] If my code was described as magic I'd be pretty happy tbh... [end]
[start] Come on, as long as they think what we do is magic, we'll get paid decently.  If they understand what we do they'll just be afraid. [end]
[start] *sigh*  *invents magic* [end]
[start] The amount of times I've explained my code using the term "auto-magically" is too damn high [end]
[start] Tbh having your work be called magic sounds like a good compliment [end]
[start] I don't think it's a local network data streaming type of thing. It probably uses sockets to send data between you and the server (and then eventually your other devices). [end]
[start] "Only WE (programmers) are allowed to use that term! It's so we don't have to waste time explaining our hard work to people who only care about its market viability, BILLY." [end]
[start] Nah, they just send HTTP data that includes song id and time through the server. [end]
[start] APIgically [end]
[start] You’re reading this completely wrong. Making it feel like magic is exactly what’s cool about programming! [end]
[start] That's just front-end programmers for you [end]
[start] "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."  -- Arthur C. Clarke [end]
[start] "robust" [end]
[start] Too bad Spotify's device select is still bugged to shit. [end]
[start] Great software is magic. [end]
[start] My other favorite word is "mathemagically" [end]
[start] They won't be as sad when they get payed [end]
[start] I feel pretty good if I build something that can be called magic actually [end]
[start] I mean cmon isn’t this the point of abstraction? Providing a useful function while hiding the implementation? If users think it’s wonderful magic then the work was done amazingly well [end]
[start] All those microservices doing work! [end]
[start] I think this misses the mark completely.  If someone describes the results of your work as magic that's a hell of a compliment.  Mostly they'll just ignore it and be completely ignorant of its work behind the veil. If they notice it at all, chances are it's to complain about something. [end]
[start] I'd much rather be called a wizard than a software developer. [end]
[start] "Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology."  -Sir Pterry [end]
[start] TIL upnp is magic. [end]
[start] For it to play on two devices is three same streaming as over internet.   They don't have to recreate anything.   Either it indicates to spotify to stream to s different connected device, or it streams from one app to another over your network.   There's nothing additional that requires major development.  If you hook into spotify on your local network on two devices, you can accomplish the same thing with a pair of chat bots.  This is basically all SignalR is.  The magic part is having the patience or employer that'll let you do the job correctly. [end]
[start] Third law of Arthur C. Clarke:  Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. [end]
[start] Similar sentiment for IT.   Average employee: "What does IT even do around here? I've been working here for years and never had a problem."  IT: "You're welcome." [end]
[start] "magic" is the word I use when I'm not feeling like explaining my manager how I did it. [end]
[start] Months to copy/paste stackexchange? [end]
[start] Wait, does it actually stream locally? I figured that all devices would use their own internet connection to stream, and this interface just controlled them remotely via that same internet connection. [end]
[start] I feel sorry for the programmers who spent a millennia creating/fixing/securing something only to have someone I'm trying to help shit all over it with something like, "These big fucking companies think they're gods and can do whatever they want but they broke my shit so make it work!  I don't want any fucking updates!  You know what, screw this. Give me my money back and put Windows 7 back on!!"   (Ma'am, I understand you're upset but this is a new system that doesn't support 7 and you were just hit by ransomware and lost a lot of money not too long ago because you were running outdated shit. So I'm sorry your 10 yr old FB spamware game suddenly stopped working but please don't blame them...) [end]
[start] The developer is over 30 and still virgin so he is a wizard [end]
[start] They’re *Illusions*, Michael. [end]
[start] The magic is bcs the developers are wizards, and the months it took was them gathering ingredients for potions to increase their magical ability [end]
[start] To be fair, to build a system so solid and reliable that's considered magic would make me very proud [end]
[start] Last month I was sitting up crying and reading Chrome source code because the developer tools refused to match local and remote source files.  The manual option had been removed in favor of a "magic" option that "just works". [end]
[start] The goal of good software is to do something complicated in a way that requires as little input or direction from the user as possible. If you needed to be a network engineer to use chromecast no one would buy them. [end]
[start] They called their work magical, I would be proud [end]
[start] This is because the team behind Spotify development are InforMagicians, they studied InforMagic and this is how it works.   At least they don't have to explain bugs, it's magic and it has a lot of counter effect in casting spell, you know [end]
[start] Except my Google casting devices. Can't see them from Spotify desktop, can see them from Spotify on my phone.  So, in a convoluted way, I can start music on my desktop, whip out my phone and start Avatar tune-bending the music from my PC to the house speakers and TVs.  Cool workaround, still annoying. [end]
[start] In all fairness that means you get to describe yourselves as wizards, which is dope as heck [end]
[start] Honestly, this is a big compliment. If (in general) ppl have the thought 'it just works, like magic' then it means the team did a good job. [end]
[start] I mean there sometimes is code that you just don't know how it works, don't know why it works, all you know is that if you remove it your program breaks so you just leave it do it's magic. [end]

[start] I distrust and fair any software that works or claims to work by magic. Magic is fragile. [end]
[start] The developers sound like first-class snowflakes. [end]

[start] Looks like I'm a wizard [end]
[start] The more programming I learn, the futur funnier I find this sub.   Btw if anyone wants to hire an unemployed dad switching careers, hmu. [end]
[start] It's not much of a stretch to say we are magicians. [end]
[start] They are magicians , thats the highest tier of programmer! [end]
[start] Given the experience I had with Spotify streaming, I'd call it get from robust lol [end]
[start] Spotify works way better with my Chromecasts/Google Homes than Youtube Music (you know, the music service behind Chromecasts/Google Home).   Like, Spotify always successfully starts the stream and near instantly. YouTube Music takes a solid 15-30 seconds to start playing and it fails 20% of the time. [end]
[start] I so hate that term. My former director used to say that all the time, thus denying the underlying effort it took to create the system that worked “automagically.” [end]
[start] Tidal doesn't let you do it that way tho :( [end]
[start] "Robust" [end]
[start] Until they fix shuffle, they aren't magical to me [end]
[start] I think that was written sarcastically, because the Spotify connect feature works like dog shit. [end]
[start] "When you do things right, people won’t be sure you’ve done anything at all" [end]
[start] I get irrationally angry when I hear the word “automagically”. It’s just such a stupid made-up term. It means literally the exact same thing as “automatically”, but it’s way more pretentious. [end]
[start] I created an application to solve some work issue. I’d done some light coding in excel VBA and thought I was hot shit. It took forever, looked like a geo cities nightmare, but it worked. It was amazing. Felt great.   As part of my “hotshittedness” I put snarky little pop ups everywhere. One of them referenced doing thing “automagically” because I also thought I was clever. Turns out that shit is as common as my awful coding project and I’m properly ashamed.   Still it jumpstarted my desire to keep coding and after far too many years I will have a BSIST this year so... yay? [end]
[start] I mean, it's not wrong. Obviously there's code involved, and it isn't magic, but it might as well be. My google phone can't find my google homes to play spotify on them, but if I tell my google home to play spotify, then it magically shows up that it's connected and I can control it on my phone. [end]
[start] My housemates love it when I start playing music at work... and the audio comes out of my machine at home.  Covid ended that issue, though. :-) [end]
[start] I actually kinda hate this feature. It’s cool and all but ehat I’m listening to on my phone while working out or whatever is different than when I’m sitting at my desk working. I want them to persist differently. [end]
[start] Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Take the compliment ;P [end]
[start] My single greatest programming accomplishment to date is something that other programmers I work with also refer to as magic. [end]
[start] Dude this totally means you guys are wizards though [end]

[start] Must be using Ruby on Rails [end]
[start] I mean, a feature that just works "magically" is one of the highest aspirations of a software developer. Typically, developers strive to create technology that provides a seamless, intuitive, and easy-to-use experience for the user, but being able to describe it as working "like magic" is a crowning achievement. [end]
[start] Arthur C. Clarke's third law applies: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. [end]
[start] Nice sugar coating for DRM tech ☺️. [end]
[start] I'm going to swap the words algorithm with spell, pattern with ritual, and ai for black magic.   Anny ideas for other areas, databases, data structures, and so on?   Front end is just illusions hiding the real magic behind it. [end]
[start] Hey idk I feel like as a developer it would be pretty cool to be compared to a wizard [end]
[start] I think I'd be happy if a feature I own is called magic. 🤗 [end]
[start] Yet, the application for Samsung tv often disappeared from the network. [end]
[start] You don’t  understand now you can claim the title of Wizard/sorcerer/ warlock [end]
[start] Huh??? Shouldn’t it just be:  If device on network, then connect [end]
[start] I’d rather call it “magic” than have to explain my source code. [end]
[start] Too bad it doesn't work fluently. A lot of times it just doesn't see my chromecasts. [end]
[start] Bro if I could write magic to define my code I would take it as a compliment of the highest. My code is so flawless and good it is like magic to a normal person. Honestly nothing better. [end]
[start] Its account based, not network based [end]
[start] Its probably been posted 1000 times, but  That's the sign of good software!!!  The user shouldn't be aware of all the difficulties and implantation details. It should just work. Like magic.  /rant [end]
[start] ah yes, i love it when im trying to jam on my pc but it streams to my phone lmao. jk i do like being able to come to my pc to change playlists even when listening on my phone while doing chores. pc the playlists are in the same place so easy to find. phone they're all over the place. [end]
[start] Except the device you're trying to connect to is the ONE missing one (the desktop app fucks up a lot) [end]
[start] from magic import devices [end]
[start] I mean hey they pretty much just called it Clarketech with is just about the highest honor you could get.  "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" -Arthur C Clarke [end]
[start] The only thing I wish apps included when using Chromecast is a button to refresh looking for devices on the network. I think they only look when the app is first started, so sometimes I need to completely close the app I want to use, then start it back up just to find my Chromecast. [end]
[start] I swear to god any client of mine over the past twenty years of developing websites always laughs when I use the phrase “automagically” to describe any sort of self automation. “I love this! I’m gonna remember this for later”. Still works to this day. [end]
[start] I make double what my nurse wife does as a developer and do approx 1/10th the work she does. Let's "Keep Programming Magic". [end]
[start] Fuck you 'robust' [end]
[start] In my experience none of those people actually have a problem with their work being referred to as “Magic”. [end]
[start] It doesn't stream locally though [end]
[start] Note: Some magic may take longer than others. If magic does not magic at all, please let the wizards know by clicking *here*. [end]
[start] More like, "It will *usually* appear without any effort, and if it doesn't, it will be hell to debug because we concealed all the implementation details in an attempt to make this look sleek." [end]
[start] People aren’t allowed to joke anymore I guess [end]
[start] i mean, isn’t there a lawsuit in the works about spotify stealing this technology from sonos? [end]
[start] High praise to the programmers who made it possible for me to controle YouTube on my PS4 with my phone. Now I can smoke a bowl and chill to the extreme. Thank you! [end]
[start] Basically how I feel when I'm using libraries and coding to interfaces, honestly.   "You mean this is implemented *where*?" "Nobody knows, man." [end]
[start] The sad part is sometimes you just don't want it to connect. Say account sharing or such, and it becomes annoying that you can't turn it off. [end]
[start] And spotify still doesn't have 2fa [end]
[start] In Unreal Engine 4 there is a auto conversion tool from visual graph scripting to c++, the dev who wrote the tool admits it's basically magic and admits it in the documentation. [end]
[start] It's called UX, the user doesn't benefit from knowing how much work went into it, only that it works. [end]
[start] All he has to find all the Replicas too [end]
[start] It’s magic because even the developers don’t quite know how their code worked [end]
[start] Unfortunately they would also sometimes magically disappear/not show at all [end]
[start] It means it happens instantly [end]
[start] As someone who does live production, the goal is for things to work in a way that it seems that you are invisible.   If no one noticed you, you did great. If someone did notice, you probably fucked up. [end]
[start] This specific feature is built so badly, it is the reason I chose an alternative platform over Spotify.  My whole house has Chromecast speakers, which are allegedly supported, but it always takes two tries minimum to connect.  If I was a developer, I'd also want to disassociate my name from this crap implementation. [end]
[start] Yeah except it works like 1 out of 10 times for me so indeed that is magical [end]
[start] Chromecast and Air Drop developers felt sad [end]
[start] Nah, coding is totally magic. I’m cool with everyone thinking that what we do is magic. Lmao [end]
[start] Just saying it's not just over local networks. I'm in Australia and I was able to control a Spotify client running in Israel [end]
[start] Software-to-english translation guide:  "Magically" -> "hopefully" [end]

[start] With the previous version of Git? [end]
[start] OMG... this post is from someone who fundamentally doesn't understand how fucked up the media consumption ecosystem is. "Just Works".. that is fucking hilarious. From the shit show that is HDMI to media consumption. There are more than double the lines of code in current operating systems and software to PREVENT you from doing the things you want to do (things that are legal other than the DMCA preventing you cracking the encryption).   Another shitshow example is streaming to chromecast devices. Ever thought about why the fuck your chromecast has to connect to the internet to stream from a local source? Why you can't stream directly from a local PC or data warehouse to the device (controlled by the device sending the data?) It's because the chromecast has to do it's own policing of the data stream to know whether to let you do it or not. It's 10 times more complex than it needs to be because of the shit in there to stop you from doing things and to control your consumption. Ever wonder why you can pay legally for netflix or other streaming services and play them back on the player of YOUR choice? It's because they want to control the playback system as well to create a closed ecosystem. If you can choose the player you want, they won't be able to enforce that they can see everything that you  (whether it's legal or not). No. software is severely fucked and broken by design. Not just working. [end]
[start] Just like my queue magically vanishes a few times a week [end]
[start] I like when my code it's called magic. I hate when gnomes mess with it. [end]
[start] Spotify Connect really is like magic. Nothing else comes close. [end]
[start] What is robust data data streaming network?? [end]
[start] From the devs I know they'd rather just say magic to the end user. Usually safer than trying to explain. [end]
[start] It's a version of the Tech blindness, I think. When stuff is working, people wonder why Tech gets paid to sit around, when stuff's broken people wonder why they're paying tech to let that happen. Meanwhile the background juggling and engineering feats to keep stuff working. [end]
[start] More work from that of a Systems Engineer than developer, but OK.  :(  I'll just stay in my dark room while you guys celebrate. [end]
[start] Oh shit, that's me! Or at least a small part of it was me :P there's probably at least a couple hundred people who contributed to this feature if not more 😅 [end]
[start] They're called Tech Wizards for a reason [end]
[start] Shouts out to Spotify for being basically the only company actually using algorithms for pure good though. Those guys at least put in the good work to earn all my personal, private information. [end]
[start] Is he sitting in the seat behind you. [end]
[start] You don't know what "robust" means [end]
[start] Local networks? This has nothing to do with that..  It's the account settings stored in Spotify's user database which denotes which devices you're listening to [end]
[start] Well... sometimes i cant ve happier if i make some feature on the project an in the month nobody knows i ever even seen the code [end]
[start] I would want my work to look magical, because then they think I know my shit. *I should be more humble* [end]
[start] Spend months.... So you're saying it's not normal to build and deploy a full API in two days with no documentation or build requirements? [end]
[start] The most of the users don't care  if you spent months or years building the system XD [end]
[start] I feel like the word "local" is added just to sound more complicated, good meme nevertheless [end]
[start] its not even just LAN, it works anywhere you are signed in [end]
[start] This is just abstraction. When learning hash tables the teacher introduced hash functions as a "magic function that gives you what you are looking for" to not complicate us with the math behind them. Exactly the same the upper panel is doing [end]
[start] I see it as a compliment.  You were able to make something so complex that to ordinary people it looks like magic. [end]
[start] If someone thinks my software is magic that's high praise, no issues here [end]
[start] The developers:  "Thank you for the help Gandalf. We have no idea how to make this thing works" [end]
[start] Mages are just fantasy programmers [end]
[start] I hate this kind of stuff so much, you never know why devices don't get recognized  I mean hell, it might be a bit too much for some but at least having the option to manually input the ip of a device would be good or having a refresh button as a placebo [end]
[start] Even for that developer it seems like magic that it even worked [end]
[start] It's not just for local networks, a bunch of my amazon and google home devices will show up on it no matter where I am [end]
[start] From [the Jargon File](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/)'s entry on [magic](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/magic.html), sense 4, noun:  > The ultimate goal of all engineering & development, elegance in the extreme; from the first corollary to Clarke's Third Law: “Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced”.

[start] imagine telling someone you worked on that for months and they reply: "that's it? what else you did?" [end]
[start] I'm not exactly a coder but I'm ok when my work is described as magic tbh. It makes for less explaining. [end]
[start] Controlling volume on Spotify desktop app running on PC, through Android is buggy. Keeps reverting to a high level, I don't know why. Also, sometimes hitting play on the desktop app infinitely keeps skipping to the next song without playing any. [end]
[start] On windows it actually doesn't matter because it never works [end]
[start] I'd be pretty flattered if someone referred to a feature I built as magic [end]
[start] I love doing open source software. [end]
[start] I'm ok with it, but can my title be magician now? [end]
[start] Let's not forget the Indian guy on YouTube then [end]
[start] Look, every time I present a new PoC I use "magically" somewhere.  We ARE magicians after all. [end]

[start] This probably would not trigger overflow, be indicative of a signed integer or a value stored in a database (both could be vulnerable to this kind of issue).  1) Storing the upvote count in a database.  Storing it in a DB would create a huge deadlock because so many threads would try to query the current value, increase by one, then commit the new number to the DB (possibly as an Automatic Increment).  The higher the votes, the slower it would get well below 4 million.  2) As an int stored in Memory.  They are running redis or memory (or both), which issued for this kind of thing. The problem is the data can be ephemeral and vulnerable loss on OS/App shutdown, crash, or network conditions. This is why it must be committed to disk.  The most likely way it is being tracked is by using a RDB count() statement. There are probably 2 tables for each thread: users who upvote, or users who downvote.  Then you just count the rows for each to get the numbers.  Their database is probably "straw polled": first come, first serve. This would explain why if you refresh you could get a different number.  I may be wrong on how, but I would almost guarantee that the value is not incremented up with an int field type. That's how crashes and exploits happen (overflow the memory into protected space, then executing code in that space.  This is one of the huge benefits of Java; overflows are super rare due to the jvm-- but can happen. [end]

[start] i had this problem today with a web service call, tried turning a string to a double, failed optional (swift) but when I tried using an UInt64 that failed sometimes because my NSDate was returning a negative number sometimes. fun times.edit: the whole issue was using a web service with epoch time, which is different for Java from Swift so the code to compensate with that had loads of bugs [end]

[start] Here, have mine. Only roughly 4294936496 more to go. I can almost smell the 503 error page already. [end]
[start] it would be better for op if we downvoted instead. because after overflow he would have positive karma. [end]

[start] Doing my part.  [end]
[start] You're all basing this on the assumption that the field is not a character field of length 2000. [end]
[start] big if true. [end]
[start] Nothing like a good ol' fashioned upvote whore. Just take it, okay?! Gosh. [end]
[start] Someone get /r/sockoff on this! [end]
[start] I did my part [end]
[start] What if it is 64 bit int or a Boolean list? [end]
[start] It's impossible. [end]
[start] I want to see it happen [end]
[start] Let's fucking do it! [end]
[start] I can say I was apart of this  [end]
[start] "if at all the Integer was as deep as your eyes, it would never overflow." [end]
[start] How about we double that? [end]
[start] It might... [end]
[start] Im doing my part. [end]
[start] Be right back.  Switching to a long. [end]
[start] I was part of the history. (was I?) [end]
[start] The web is a great place. [end]
[start] do they even have 2^32 users on reddit? [end]
[start] I'm staking my claim on possible Reddit history.  Hope this works. [end]
[start] I am sad that I have but one upvote to give for my subreddit... [end]
[start] It's a trap! Well I did my part... [end]
[start] This is very interesting.  [end]
[start] Reddit developers can easily fix it on the fly, just change the field into Big Int in database and that's it .. a 1 sec fix [end]
[start] Break the 32-bit integer limit! BRRRREEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKK!! [end]
[start] Get this to /r/all to show this post some upvote love! [end]
[start] Oo if we could reach it, then one more and this would have negative upvotes. We just need like 4 billion more redditors and we could break the karma system!! [end]

[start] No interest in gaming IDs just fulfilling my cyber duty, upvoting.  [end]
[start] Let's go boys! Sent it to friends and bots :DDDDD We should do this shit xD [end]

[start] It’s always the fucking email. ALWAYS THE FUCKING EMAIL!!!     (This post has apparently triggered me.) [end]
[start] This hit a sore spot deep down somewhere.  I came up in an industry where the majority of my peers were high school drop outs, most of my peers still chicken peck when typing. The younger generation of workers are all better with technology now but the majority of workers who enter into the field side of the industry aren’t generally tech savvy.   I learned to type playing video games, and spent many a night tucked away in my hotel or work camp room hundreds if not thousands of miles from home learning and self teaching myself everything I know about technology or that I wanted to learn. *I took the initiative* and yes you can teach an old dog new tricks.   My reward has not been some high paid technology job, but instead many friends, family and co-workers relying on me for help. I’m ok with this within reason and even happy to do it if it’s on my terms. But absolutely nothing drives me more nuts than those that either: - Don’t take the initiative to try and help themselves out first (we have thousands and thousands of petabytes of knowledge at our fingertips, no reason you can’t at least make an attempt). - Don’t respect your time. The amount of times I’ve gotten the whole “hey I need your help ASAP” texts/calls/etc. drive me wild. I have my own life and precious time away from work so if I’m on a day off or busy with family or in the middle of my work day, I’ll help you when I can, but it’s not going to be ASAP and I’m not dropping everything to come rescue you.  Sorry to vent, but wow people can be so inconsiderate. [end]
[start] My favorite one to date.  "Hey SpoontToodage, can you fix my TV? It only turns on sometimes, but the remote doesn't work"  Did you try the buttons on the side?  "No those are broken.

[start] They do say that you start off knowing a lot about something and the more specialist education you get about it the less you realise you actually know. [end]
[start] My uncle once told my nephew to not go into computer science because there’s no money in it. His rationale was that everyone knows how to fix computers these days so it’s a waste of a degree.   I was sitting right next to him. He thought he was being slick taking a swipe at me. How’s your job at the gas station going? [end]
[start] Computer science is as much about computers as astronomy is about telescopes [end]
[start] I worked in IT for getting on for 20 years, it took me quitting work due to needing surgery and not using a windows PC for the last three years to finally get out of providing familial IT support. It was one of the best things about having a degenerative spinal disorder. [end]
[start] My PC is so slow, I only bought it 15 years ago. Can you fix it? [end]
[start] “No, sorry, that’s hardware. I’m in software.” [end]

[start] I got an easy out that's actually true: I'm a Linux user and don't know much about Windows. [end]
[start] Asking a programmer to fix your computer is like asking a chef to fix your stove.  And on the flip side, asking an IT guy to make your app idea is like asking an appliance repairman how to cook beef wellington. [end]

[start] I work on a Helpdesk and study Networking.  One of the guys in my circle had a lady come up to him and say “you look like you’re good with computers. And math”  Needless to say he’s our designated tech expert now [end]
[start] my brother uses a Chromebook for school, he was fucking furious when I explained that I couldn't install Fortnite on it, I tried to explain how it didn't have the right OS or Cpu architecture (Fortnite for mobile wasn't out at this time but even if it was ChromOS can only install some Android stuff), but he just threw a toy truck at me and my mom grounded him, he still thinks I'm just being a dick when I won't install Windows applications on his pc, and refuses to learn about basic computer science.  &#x200B;  did I mention he's 13?

[start] I once went to a party and not one but two guys I barely talked to (one of them an in-law) were waiting for me to ask if I could fix their laptops because they were watching “videos” and their machines got infected. I fixed one of them while I was helping the DJ and when I said it was going to be $120 for the fix the other one slowly disappeared from the DJ Booth haha STOP IT PEOPLE! [end]
[start] I told someone I was a software engineer the other day. They legit asked me if I could help them come up with wifi, that uses a different source of energy.  I did spend a couple minutes explaining to them what wifi was, how it worked, and that they'd need to find a new medium that could transfer packets as well as a 2.4/5ghz radio wave. But I also explained that me knowing that has nothing to really do with software engineering.  Tbh, I might be one of the reasons this myth exists. I got my start in tech building and fixing computers, and fixing phone screens for people. It's how I made my money in high school. [end]
[start] "oh you study engineering for materials, for sure you know how to fix my car". No I don't. But my best guess is you need to change the owner, he's the faulty one. [end]

[start] My university calls it computing science because we  learn almost nothing about hardware. [end]
[start] “Computers have really changed a lot in the last couple years, I don’t really know that much anymore” [end]
[start] I was at the barber and 2 people that work  for one of our software partners are there, I live in a small town so I was super excited to meet someone else in IT. Suddenly a lady also overheard the same conversation and started telling them about her nephew that is good with the computers, and with the internet,  oh and by the way needs a job. This went on for a while. I didn't say a word. After she left I introduced myself and we had a conversation. [end]
[start] I read the "No" in Gilfoyle voice. [end]
[start] I just love helping my grandma with technology.  "My new set-top box doesn't work anymore." *plugs HDMI cable back into TV* "Thanks a lot, you're awesome!"  Or  "Can you tune in new channels on my TV?"  Or  "Can you adjust my clock for daylight saving time?" [end]
[start] TBH I really don't care if someone wants me to fix something. But what really pisses me off is people calling me asking, my phone doesn't do *this and that*, me: okay what phone: a Samsung, me: yes but what Samsung? : I'm not a technical person [end]
[start] Do you know how to hack a Facebook account? [end]
[start] PRINTER. FUUUUUCK PRINTERS. [end]
[start] I don't even have my degree yet and they still ask me [end]
[start] Afterwards you find yourself doing what they want no matter how many times you said NO. [end]
[start] Can you fix my insert device?  Fnar! [end]
[start] I, unfortunately do not have that luxury. I have the CS degree and I owned a house call computer repair business.  So like... I am totally screwed. [end]
[start] Well yes, but its my job and here's my rates and estimates. Or you can take it to geek squad [end]
[start] ^ this is a*device* used to*sciao*. [end]
[start] No, i don't know about fixing computers. i know about programming them [end]
[start] Oh yes I see. You're getting the ID-10-T error.  Afraid there's no fix for it. Sorry. [end]
[start] I go to a tech collage and surprising most people cant even install a hard drive. It is kinda sad. [end]
[start] Has degree in computer science...  Actually doesn't know anything about computers [end]
[start] "fix my phone" [end]
[start] “You make websites right?” [end]
[start] At least she’s honest [end]
[start] I get this from my family, friends, relatives and co-workers and my boss it probably doesn't help that I run a small side gig as an IT and that  have like 9 PC's that I am working on in my room at almost all times [end]

[start] My typical response is “I’m better at breaking them”. [end]
[start] "ME" will be **me** this Saturday :) [end]
[start] I worked or AOL for about 15 months, until I got laid off when the company was doing massive cuts.  I didn't even like to mention it, because I knew absolutely nothing about the AOL client... I never used it... and I was always afraid people would ask me to help them with AOL. [end]
[start] Crisis averted [end]
[start] Nothing worse than when your insert device is broken and relatives won’t help you with it. [end]
[start] I mean, I can, but I probably won't. Unless you give me you know, food. Or better yet, money. [end]
[start] This is why I hate going home for the holidays. I constantly get a “my device doesn’t work can you fix it” conversation at someone’s house. Not to mention that they want me to fix it during whatever holiday party we are having and I just want to get drunk. Probably the worst decision I ever made was being a computer science major. [end]
[start] I once had a comp sci intern ask me how to plug in a usb keyboard because it was broken. Turns out Num Lock was not on ... [end]
[start] And as the holidays fast approach, this becomes more and more relatable. [end]
[start] Thermonuclear bomb [end]
[start] Am I the only programmer that doesn't mind doing free tech support for nice people? Usually it's as simple as googling the error message and installing a driver or something, and for me solving IT problems is as rewarding as fixing a difficult bug. [end]
[start] I will take a crack at fixing ANY device, except a printer! Throw that demon possessed shit out the window and buy a new one. [end]
[start] My mother wanted me to setup Netflix for her on her Fire stick over thanksgiving.   I absolutely refused—don’t need my dad blaming me every time his printer stops working for the next six months.  Honestly, he’d be happier to pay Geek Squad $200 to come over and set it up, and he can blame them for everything.  I figure they’re paid to take the grief. [end]
[start] Yeah lol. My entire family. [end]
[start]  “Oh thank god you’re good with computers, I have this Sony Betamax player and I can’t get the clock on it to stop flashing midnight” [end]
[start] Got tired of watching my relatives fuddle around with old Garmin navigation tech so I introduced Siri.  No huge issues so far but it loves to not work when it needs to.  Also introduced Echos and Alexa to them and they at least understand what limitations it has.  Now at work, I'm the newest member of a tech support team. The questions thrown at me and expectations people have are just out there. Once you're done barking your issues at me who did not sign off to have this program installed nor had anything to do with the approval process, I would love to work the problem with you. [end]
[start] My sister's family came up for Thanksgiving and soon as they arrived on Tuesday (while I was still at work) they started sending me texts about their laptop and a Chromecast they brought with them. Damnit if you bring it with you, know how to freaking use it. [end]
[start] The best part about marrying an IT guy is that no one comes to me with the “can you reset my password?” Questions [end]
[start] I went to school for cyber security and networking and I have no idea how many times my dad (who has a comp sci degree) has said "my internet connection is slow/not working, are you inviting hackers into our network?" [end]
[start] See, the easiest way to prevent this is to ask whoever is asking you to do something related to their profession for you (for free of course, because they always expect that of you).   Oh your computer is running slow? I suppose I could look at it, but you know what, I really need my water heater replaced. [end]
[start] I do the same and I have a degree in computer engineering [end]
[start] I'm not bothered by my friends and close family asking. I'm happy to help people who don't know as much about computers as I do.  The thing I hate is when a friend who hasn't contacted you for years or a distant relative/acquaintance you last saw five years ago contacts you and has the nerve to ask you to fix their computer for free.

[start] Lol I went on a trip recently and they were asking which person in the group was the most tech savvy to see if they could fix something and we all introduced ourselves. And when they got to me, I was like I mean I’m getting my masters in IT but that’s it [end]

[start] Im basically free tech support for my entire extended family.  It started with fixing emails, streaming movies, setting up google homes, connecting wifi.

[start] This is the biggest reason I have an Android phone and don't own one single Apple product.  I don't have anything against Apple, I just fine that the dumbest tech users I know have an iPod, an iPad, and an iPhone all wrongly connected to iTunes, and I love that I can honestly say that I don't even know how to open the menu on an apple device.  I'll never own an apple product for exactly this reason.  And for other people, I just turn it around.  Someone who is a car mechanic asks for help - my reply is absolutely, my water pump has been squeaking.  Just give me a call and we can trade work - I'll fix your windows internet while you replace my water pump.  Never once have I heard from someone after that.  Not a single time. [end]

[start] I spent 2 hours trying to figure out why my test cases were failing at random. It just writes in a concurrent dictionary. 2 lines of code? Why isn't it fucking working?  Are there nulls? Nope.  Is the key wrong? Nope.  Maybe locks will solve this! Pfff.  Maybe I should add a thread sleep? This is pointless.  I'll debug each test individually! Nope, they all pass.  Maybe it's a build issue? Deleted the entire fucking thing, new checkout and nope didn't work.   What the fuck is wrong!    After some amount of crying, turns out, the god damn dictionary was made private static, instead of just private by some dipshit. It kept trying to insert the same key, across objects, again and again and again.    Why did I choose this line of work? [end]

[start] You can build life once you are programmer.   After being programmer: where did my life go? [end]
[start] I just made a program that will start stuff at certain times. Think livestream starting at 8 and am URL opens. Or a teams meating at 2 and teams will start so I won't forget.  How long did it take to make? About 4 hours. How much will it have? Literally nothing and an alarm would probably work better.  But I love it because I made it. [end]

[start] I don't understand shit like this...if you don't enjoy programming then why the fuck do you do it?

[start] Or in Java when people do this shit      catch (Exception e) {         log.error("Failure occurred");     }  In the interest of spreading knowledge, the problem is that it hides the error. You should always use the variable. Either do `throw new RuntimeException(e);` or `log.error("Failure occured", e);` (which is the fancy way to print stacktrace). [end]
[start] This is how I feel about web development in general right now. I just got back into it after 15 years.

[start] `Uncaught Error: The error you provided does not contain a stack trace.` [end]
[start] Javascript: "Oh, you divided by 0? That's completely fine with me, it's `Infinity`".  I so often had a simple error in a formula that took me way to long to find, because of this little thing :D [end]
[start] It's the price you pay for not dealing with setup.  In Javascript you never open someone's project, hit Build, and get "compiler not found." You never spend an hour crawling through the IDE's triple-nested settings page trying to rub its nose in GCC. You don't wonder how you have five versions of MinGW32 installed, or when you last used Strawberry Perl. You don't find out the actual problem is in the *project* settings, where the default compiler is set to "no compiler," and wonder why a loving god would allow that to be an option. You never get "SDL.h not found" even though it's right fucking there in /include, and then add the base folder to six separate "Search directories" settings, only to find out it wants you to directly include the /include folder, even though the compiler settings *immediately adjacent* expect a folder with /bin inside it instead of the /bin folder itself.   And all this door-in-the-face bullshit happens before you've executed a single line of code. You're just staring at the log frame and wondering if you'll ever get to the part of programming where the program happens. [end]
[start] As a hardware designer I can relate to this. You write something and simulate it. Everything is cool, no warnings, no errors. Then you run some code on it and 3+3 results in -2048 or some shit. [end]
[start] Idk why the error messages actually _are_ a hit or miss for me. No sometimes no stack trace, sometimes nodemon just be like "app crash waiting for restart" or the rage inducing worst "handled promise rejection warning. This is deprecated". That's fine and all. But could you tell me WHERE I didnt handle it so I can, you know, actually take your advice? [end]
[start] "uNdEfInEd Is NoT a FuNcTiOn" [end]
[start] At least it's not swift which would tell you it's because of something completely unrelated which is actually not even an error, but the compiler broke while handling the inner error and just started making shit up. [end]
[start] Common lisp: "ok heres your problem. Now what do you do? Yes I'm litteraly asking you what you want to do heres choices on the screen you can even make the program continue anyway I don't care. But you'll probably just make it stop [end]
[start] To answer the question earnestly, because of a few reasons.  One: difference in their purpose. A normal language is just something you'll generally just use to get a message across, not to get someone to actually do something. This means its meaning can be more imprecise without the outcome being wrong. The difference between "Nice weather", "Amazing weather" and "Perfect weather" is negligible. The "degree" of niceness isn't very important to what you want to convey.  Compare this for example to writing a shopping list: a shopping list is almost more like you're actually coding, because you're writing a set of instructions for yourself or someone else. Yet, you don't normally use language in this way. Shopping lists are vulnerable to similar errors as programming languages. For example, misspell a brand name, and the person shopping on your behalf might give you a call later because they have no clue what you meant. Or if there are different sizes and you just specificed a number, they might ask whether you mean the big one or the small one, etc.  Two: natural language is *full* of redundancy. Programming languages only have this in a limited capacity. In JavaScript, the semicolon is optional most of the time. It doesn't do anything other than make something explicit that JS already knows, just to make it easier to see where something is going wrong. Type declarations are also redundant. They're not *necessary* for a language, but can make errors easier to see.  That's just about where it ends. If I sey someting liek this, you can see where I've gone wrong. But in JavaScript, there's no way to tell whether I wanted to use an if statement, or whether I wanted to execute a function called "fi" if I do this: `fi (x>y) { return z }`. Because so many sequences of characters potentially have meaning, you can't look at something and easily reason that it's incorrect as a machine.  In addition, programming languages lack context. Statements are really short most of the time, and when they're not, they're just composed of subexpressions which are evaluated separately. This is completely different from how sentences work. A natural language has verbs, adjectives, nouns, adpositions, articles, affixes, demonstratives, and so forth, which all have a different function and serve different purposes in different parts of a sentence. A programming langauge is laid out far too simplistically for this. It mostly just has operators, reserved words and an infinite amount of non-reserved words, and operators and reserved words aren't really even much different from one another. This extra context we get in natural languages from having so many types of words add another layer of redundancy.  Finally, I want to address *why* natural language is like this. The answer is simple: it makes it easier to communicate if a slight error doesn't cause everything to break down. It means we don't have to make sure to pronounce everthing *exactly* right, and it means we can even be understood if circumstances aren't ideal, such as shouting to someone in a hurricane. If *most* of what we're saying comes across, it's usually pretty easy to work out what the rest was, just from that.  Programming languages don't have to worry about imperfections in the communication medium, and it's more important that they're concise, unambiguous and easy to learn. In addition, coming up with a language takes far more effort if you want to build in the kind of ambiguity that natural language has, and that is not even including the extra effort it would take to program the natural error correction ability that humans have into an IDE, interpreter or compiler.

[start] The last guy left me with a pot of beef stew. He said it only needed seasoned and reheated, but he's used diced carrots instead of sliced. So I've decided to remake it as a chicken pie.  [end]
[start] You accidentally peel the carrot backwards. The pot explodes. You need to reinstall your stove.  You try again the next day with a new carrot. You forget to properly end the carrot. You end up peeling the cutting board, the benchtop, the sink, 3 plates, a potplant, your dog, until the house crashes because you tried to peel the wall. And only because the peeler is incompatible with the wall, you need a wallpaper scraper. [end]

[start] Anyone have a recipe for a delicious carrot, chicken, and potato soup?  Nevermind. Figured it out.  [end]
[start] You forgot a null terminator, so the oven cooks you, your dog, your S.O., and your neighbors cat.  [end]
[start] No, but my peeler got rusty and now I have to learn about "ownership" or some bullshit. [end]
[start] Does that makes online recipes the equivalent of stack overflow? [end]
[start] My peeler was made with Rust; makes it safer to use. [end]

The documentation for all of these is virtually non-existent and there are still bugs. Good luck! [end]

[start] Or worse, carrots are now poisonous and the pot will scream at you for 5 mins as it decides what to do.  It might cook or you might need to find turnips from this one guy and hope he provides them to the public. Cause maybe a big company bought him out and now you have o pay for both the turnips and cheese that you don't need cause they only sell them together.  &#x200B;  Then again the pot might cook, and you'll forever be in terror of cooking the same dish again. [end]
[start] You know what's even better?  Sometimes, you find out the spatula or knife you have been using to cut carrots and stir stew is technically for cutting steak or for stirring Pasta.    But it doesn't matter because it STILL WORKS. [end]
[start] You chop the carrot  You gather the chopped carrot  You chop the carrot  You gather the chopped carrot  You chop the carrot  Exception in thread "Carrot" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0 [end]
[start] So here's what we've figured out so far.  StewStorm supports Carrot, but doesn't support broth. We could use Stock, but Stock hasn't been updated in 10 months and there are 400 issues on their github repo that have gone unanswered. We decided to go with the Web-S2.0 framework because it still supports Carrots, but it does not support Java 8, which is the minimum support version for Potatoes. We tried to add Kidney beans but it broke the stew, because we already had Peas, which are some reason considered to be a kind of Bean and Web-S2.0 doesn't expect there to be multiple implementations of Bean available. We then decided to add several kinds of herbs, but found that they had all recently been acquired by Oracle, which removed them from Maven repository and provided a highly questionable ToS for usage. In the end, we're also looking into rolling our own, in which case we expect to be able to deliver water by the end of the quarter. [end]
[start] Hey guys does anyone know any good alternative for carrots on the new version of the peeler?  Edit: nvm figured it out [end]
[start] Hopefully there's no bugs in the carrots [end]
[start] You missed a real rhyme opportunity to end with 4.2 [end]
[start] Buy new peeler and put it in the drawer. Drawer now has trouble opening due to bloatware melon baller. Mysterious garlic crusher keeps popping up when you're cooking. [end]
[start] I hate cooking.   “Add a pinch of salt”: “What the fuck is a ‘pinch’?! What kind of spec is this?!!” [end]
[start] I think baking is more like dev and cooking is more like ops.  Baking is all about attention to detail during construction and experience with specific conditions, even if the tools themselves might be haphazard and frustrating; cooking is all about organizational prep and knowing how to respond to nonsense as it happens in the wild. [end]
[start] I'm a programmer who fucking hates cooking. Why? Because it's a fucking "dash" of salt. A cup isn't always a cup. It's now a 65 degrees in the kitchen instead of 70 so it didn't come out right. It's "I dunno, cook it like 5 minutes or until it looks <color>".  I love my morning oatmeal. 2 packets. 3/4s a cup of water. Stir. 90s in the microwave. Stir. Perfect every single time.  I love my rice cooker. 1 cup rice. 1 cup water. Press button. Enjoy when done.  Fuck cooking. [end]
[start] Little did he know that peeler was depricated and doesn't support carrots anymore. It now supports avocado's and soy [end]
[start] Peeling has been deprecated. [end]
[start] Actually, I had a shitty peeler one time and it fell apart every 3 or four passes...  And then I discovered I was supposed to be cooking gluten free. [end]
[start] Then you get to indian food where everything is based on feels [end]
[start] Better when it works just fine Tuesday, but Wednesday everything is broken even though nothing changed. [end]
[start] Back in 1990s this was the worst thing learning about Java. Everytime I learned a new method and started using it, the next week they would depreciate it. I eventually gave up trying to keep up and learnt Javascript instead. [end]
[start] I actually don't really like cooking, at least not with online recipes because they always start off with the author's life story then directions are never precise "use some parsley" how much is "some"?!?! "Add pepper until fragrant" my sense of smell is so bad, by the time I can smell the pepper, the meal will be mostly pepper. "Boil noodles until dante" (or however the fuck you spell it) WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!?! [end]

[start] So you’re saying I got swindled by my carrot peeler salesman? I just got myself a brand new iPeeler XS! [end]
[start] I should learn to like cooking for my own sake, but I feel that I hate it for the same reason i like programming. I hate doing the same thing over and over again. I "automate" it to a microwave or a restaurant.  [end]
[start] Do most programmers love to cook? I really like cooking and I had no idea that the two were associated [end]
[start] Watch how a user somehow breaks both the carrots and the peeler and it will almost never work the same way again. [end]
[start] Actually, many American recipes assume that things like "a can" or "a packet" are universal units, and that "liquid smoke" or "bovril" are ingredients. I had to purge my collection of recipes after moving to Europe. [end]
[start] Found a workaround the carrot peeler works on colored carrots so I dye my yellow carrots orange get passed QA and the client is happy no code changes needed.   [end]
[start] You peel carrots?! [end]
[start] This is some low effort stuff [end]
[start] Let's be real though. If stack overflow was like most recipe sites we'd have to read through so many developer life stories. [end]
[start] >Why programmers like \*thing\*:  >Because it's not a computer  \*25,000 programmers upvote\*  What a bizarre way to view the world and live your life. [end]

[start] HAHA UPDATES [end]
[start] But for real, does anyone else in here love to cook? [end]
[start] I'm supposed to be peeling the fucking carrot on top of chopping it??? I'm just eating out from now on [end]
[start] Ok company i work for have these washing machines cost millions. There for like hotels and shit so they are big.   Company buys them decades ago. We are on windows 10 and credit where credit is due but the company that makes these washing machines went out of business 30 - 40 years. So they havnt been updated for a long time. Oh as well there are different versions for them in each country.   They have to run on windows XP hyper visor. Whilst running windows 7 32bit. They are finally moving to windows 10 in a few months after every other devision moved to windows 10 a year ago.  [end]
[start] That does happen though. Haven't you ever been cooking and suddenly realized you don't have a critical ingredient? [end]
[start] Pro tip: you don't need to peel the carrot anyway. Not sure why people do this.  .carrot:unpeeled{stew:100%!important}  This works! [end]
[start] your peeler's next version will be a service.  but i'm happy with my peeler as it is, i don't —  IT'S GONNA BE A SERVICE GODDAMMIT  [end]
[start] BOIL ‘EM, MASH ‘EM, STICK ‘EM IN A STEW!! [end]
[start] Are they using a carrot library? Real programmers build carrots from scratch and don't need to peel them! [end]
[start] There's a workaround that requires making your own carrot-like substance. [end]
[start] To add to the horror, you usually locate such issues after hours of debugging (console.log/print debugging) in production. [end]
[start] Yeah but just like programming, the meal doesnt always compile the way you expected [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] You don’t have to include jQuery to use Blender, which is a nice break from literally every other JS library ever.  [end]
[start] Or in my experience, this happens and then you decide it's time to update it. Then suddenly the stove wont turn on without you paying for 3 years of back stove licenses. You ask the previous tenants why this is the case and they say that it should have been fine if you just lived without all the new updated carrot features, and that using the roundabout inconvenience of 20 baby carrots totally made more sense than being up to date  [end]
[start] Or you finish preparing the carrot and then find out they changed their mind and now want broccoli  [end]
[start] Carrot goes off the rails. Throw away the carrot.  [end]
[start] This is why everyone likes cooking [end]
[start] And the kitchen doesn't explode if you cook the carrot a bit too long. [end]
[start] Or you end up like me, slicing my finger open on a mandoline and now I can't program :( [end]
[start] I'm new to programming, so I feel like Captain America when I say "I understood that reference."  [end]
[start] Do you seriously like to cook or just because of the process  [end]
[start] Meh, you wouldn't get to the chopping part in this case. [end]
[start] and just like i can't program, I can't cook.  [end]
[start] Every time I hit "Run", I get a different output even if all the ingredients were the same.      That's why I hate cooking as a programmer. [end]
[start] Bcoz ur other half (partner) doesn’t cook properly perhaps!!! [end]
[start] I don't like cooking because I'm lazy [end]
[start] Actually I really love cooking [end]
[start] "Have you tried rebooting your peeler?" [end]
[start] Stew suddenly becomes incompatible with carrots v4.3.  [end]
[start] I'd hate to cook like this: You buy carrots and find that they're version 4.4, which is no longer compatible with your 4.3 peeler. You get a new peeler while you're at it, only to find that it's now a subscription service, so you need to create yet another username and password to peel carrots. Of course the fridge password won't do because it's from a different company.  Then you discover that the two peelers cannot be stored in your old drawer. You try putting it in a different drawer, but once taken out, it refuses to peel anything, talking about a path error. In the end you put the new peeler in the old drawer and the old peeler on the countertop, but there's still some weird version conflict.  Then you try to actually cook. You peel the new carrots and add them to the stew, only to see the entire kitchen shut down. Upon reading the logs, you see the version conflict again, this time between the carrots and the pot. You start looking into it, and apparently in order to cook with version 4.4 carrots you would have to upgrade your entire food processing chain from the cutting board to the toilet paper.   You give up and start ordering a pizza. At the end of the call you get the question: "...oh, and just to make sure, you do have the 4.4 upgrade, right?" [end]
[start] Or after three weeks of users demanding to know when the carrot stew is done, and all the nights in the carrot jungles digging up and preparing carrots, being told profitability is down because of your inability to get the carrots, you finally roll out the carrot stew and they all say “Ok, it needs to be spread onto this cake here.” [end]
[start] However it may occur that the carrot is rotten and it's in version 2.0 but your stomach doesn't support it and you have some critical error 😂 [end]
[start] You peel the carrots, chop the carrots, put the carrots in the stew, then your wife tell you to migrate to another kitchen because your current kitchen is not fancy enough. [end]
[start] Ahh, I see someone never tried to follow a regular recipe in a high attitude city.... [end]
[start] But the Wii stopped updating at 4.3 and I only buy Wii carrots [end]
[start] That's because the Carrot hasn't been updated in such a long time. Actually neither did other vegetables, meat and drinks. It's these peeler, blender, chopper and slicer manufacturers that keep pushing out stability and security updates, so whatever version of your kitchen tool all supports the same version of Carrot. [end]
[start] Why chefs like programming: - when you need to write a new program, the text editor doesn't call out sick, or from jail. - when you want to run a program, the interpreter doesn't suddenly forget what Ruby is, because he obviously got got blunted before dinner service. - when you download something for a project, the package manager doesn't mistakenly send 10 cases of pigs' ears. - when you routinely omit washing your hands after using the restroom, your keyboard may start to smell bad, which isn't great, however it is way better than infecting people with e. coli and killing them.  [end]
[start] lol why are you sorting comments by new [end]
[start] Why programmers hate cooking: you cook it, you use (eat) it. It no longer exists. You have to cook it again to use it again. :(  You can cook 1000 meals, and you'll still have nothing to show for it after you eat the last one. [end]
[start] Wait...  Carrots have peels? [end]

[start] Reddit’s obsession with hating hashtags and emojis is just weird [end]
[start] Ugh. A hashtag is an octothorpe and the word or conjoined words following it. Is is not appropriate to refer to the octothorpe itself as a hashtag. [end]
[start] This is a hash: #  A tag is a marker or label like this: election2020  Different languages and platforms implement tags differently:  <tag>election 2020</tag>  On many social media platforms they use a hash: #  This is a hashtag: #election2020  This is just a hash: #  This concludes the hashtag PSA. [end]
[start] Musk is such a douche. [end]
[start] In C, however, the hashtag reminds me of how little I understand about how C works. [end]
[start] When used as designed they don't bother me, but   > \#WrongUseofHashtag   \#ImStupid \#HashtagsDontWorkOnThisSite \#yolo  Annoys this piss out of me [end]

[start] Ally homies use the pound symbol instead [end]
[start] Pound sign people [end]
[start] The hashtags in Python are for comments.  Comments that tell other programmers how the program works. They are an essential part of the program and working as a team.  If you're the type of asshole who doesn't comment their code then GTFO of my face. [end]
[start] /r/Im14AndThisIsEdgy [end]
[start] Even worse are the people who say the word out loud. [end]
[start] In C/C++ it's kinda of the opposite [end]
[start] Acting like it's only Python that uses hashes for comments is so typical of a Python dev. Or someone who pretends to be one. [end]
[start] It's even worse when you have to comment virtually every single line in high school CS classes and shit turns out looking like this: ``` # This def func(x):     # Does     x += 1     # This     x -= -1     # Oh     while True:         # My         if x > 10:             # Freaking             break         else:             # God             x -= -1     # ProgrammingIsFun     return True ``` Seeing this is when you know you're in a class and they dock points for not enough comments! [end]

[start] stop with this boomer shit. Hashtags are a legitimately good way to tag content for organization. Yes some people misuse them, but so what. Doesn't diminish their value as a whole. [end]
[start] Hey guys I don't like popular trends, look how cool I am [end]
[start] #noThey'reNot [end]
[start] Python doesn't have a compiler [end]
[start] So let me get this straight. In German the shorthand for '000 is " Tsd."? Aren't you using MORE characters and screen space than just writing the full number outright? [end]
[start] That is the point of hashtags though. They're not usually meant to be read, they're generally added at the bottom. The point is to share a public post with anyone following that hashtag. It's a great way to get a page started if you do it right. [end]
[start] Aren't they meant to indicate key words for search engines? They're not meant to be part of the dialogue anyway, they just help people look up relevant topics. [end]
[start] Not wrong though. Hashtags are just tags that allow people to search and find your content. [end]
[start] Yea but the hashtag doesnt just tell the computer its not worth reading, it tells humans they really should read this. [end]
[start] The extension .py tells the user that it is not worth reading [end]
[start] R/circlejerk [end]
[start] Exactly. Nobody reads the comments. Or the documentation. Or the file that's literally called "README". [end]
[start] Didnt Musk name his son \# or something? [end]
[start] what kind of sick fuck uses twitter in german? [end]
[start] I'm melting away in C++.  It's so hard for me to accept hashtags not being used for some kind of inclusion or extra function, it's why it's actually hard for me to knuckle down and actually use Python. [end]
[start] If you're a developer, they're called pound signs not hashtags when used in code. Not gonna lie, I do poke fun of any developer who calls a pound sign a hashtag. Hashtags are dumb, pound signs are useful though #bringbackthepoundsign. [end]
[start] A hashtag is for searching, dummies.  If you have an event, you can all use a common hash tag to find relevant posts.  Like #SarahJoe2020wedding   Complaining about hashtags is some ignorant boomer shit [end]
[start] Hell nah, they give us that good categorized data and context. [end]
[start] are they a grow-a-guy? [end]
[start] In persia, hashtags are necessary else someone could sell you a cake of camel dung and you would have no recourse but to take it [end]
[start] I can definitely agree it’s proven otherwise. [end]
[start] Than whats the point of making that line. I dont program so can someone enlighten me [end]

[start] ACKKTUALLY it's called a pound sign. Derived from lb. [end]

[start] Hashtags are here to categorize similar content and make it easier to find. Elon's just a bish. [end]
[start] tHInG bAd [end]
[start] But hashtags are for separating things into topics. They're pretty useful. And they're not used in programming. Hash, as in this octothorpe symbol, '#', is used. But they're not hash*tags* by themselves. [end]

[start] `#` isn’t a “hashtag”. It’s a hash. A hashtag is a term that starts with a hash. It’s a filtering system that tags related content together. Hashtags have been abused and misunderstood since social media got ahold of them. They were used a hell of a lot earlier than social media. [end]
[start] @elonmusk is a great way to tell a line isn't worth reading too. [end]
[start] It's funny because it's true. [end]
[start] All I think of are the include statements in C++, tried to make that a comment but it just made all my text massive 😂 [end]
[start] Ah, I see, you are a man of German as well. [end]
[start] The perfect analogy: in my opinion twitter is as bad as python [end]
[start] This made my eyes roll out of my head. Hashtags are a thing now. They are used for a real purpose. [end]
[start] shut the fuck up musk [end]
[start] Maybe Python 4 can include @elonmusk for comments too [end]
[start] I read HashTable and agreed [end]
[start] It's a straight comment in GNU Make. [end]
[start] Just call them organization markers so people can't complain anymore [end]
[start] I hate that people have forced the term "hashtag" to refer to a hash/octothorpe. I find it really hard to believe that people hadn't heard of the hash key before twitrer existed [end]
[start] Seems like & in annoying web urls. There's the base info, then there's the rest of the info a site wants to pass along without using cookies or sessions or stalkers watching your every move.  Personally I'd rather go with the stalker option. It's always nice to know someone cares. [end]
[start] \# is only a hashtag when it's used to tag something for hashing. [end]
[start] Did they call it a hashtag in '91 when the language was created??...honest question [end]
[start] Hashtag sarcasm.  Back in my day they were called pound signs!  Back in my day that was just a symbol for number. [end]
[start] I get the point he was trying to make, but he's wrong.  First, a hashtag and a hash symbol (also called hash mark) are two different things. The "hash" part of hashtag means it begins with a hash symbol (#). The "tag" part is programmer jargon that means it's identifiable as usable information to the software. In this case, the term "tag" was probably inherited from the way the term is used in HTML - anything inside angle brackets is a "tag".  Second, there are no hashtags in python. The hash symbol, on other hand, is used to signify that the rest of the line contains a comment from the programmer. It does not signify that the line is not worth reading. To the contrary, comments are usually well worth reading to other programmers, but they are ignored by the python interpreter. [end]
[start] Same with R and stata [end]
[start] Okay if we’re being pedantic,  \#something <- This is a hashtag  \# <- this is the hash  something <- this is the tag [end]
[start] //Gay [end]
[start] Hashtag is just an ascii code we choose how to interpret. And ain't nothing wrong with an extra symbol. And Fuck Elon Musk. What kind of #programmer calls it a hashtag anyway? Go pound yourself [end]
[start] Do you also agree that tags on video player sites are also an abomination? Hashtags are no different than that. They’re aggregation tools for similar content. [end]
[start] Funny, because it’s like the exact opposite if you use it in the very first line to run it as an executable or to set execute conditions for other languages [end]
[start] An even bigger abomination are the people who support coups on other countries to annex their resources. [end]
[start] Only morons call them "hashtags" in python (or anything outside social media) [end]

[TITLE] Both Google and Firefox sent cakes to Microsoft's Edge team [TITLE]
[start] Someone reported this for "fucking ad".  [The cakes are a tradition and it's adorable.](https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/27/3563892/internet-explorer-and-firefox-teams-celebrate-new-versions-with-cakes) [end]
[start] I love the red squiggly line under "Bing". [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] The Firefox cake looks so much better [end]
[start] Is this real? [end]
[start] Can somebody explain to me how a company as big and powerful as Microsoft isn't able to get into the browser market and now has to rely on a competitors technology (Chromium engine), while an organization like Mozilla, without any other sources of income other than the community, can hold their own?  Is it just because they the plugin/addon infrastructure with tons of expansions for Chrome and Firefox respectively? Because other than community software like that, Microsoft easily has the resources to catch up to their competition and push them out, like they did with Teams and Slack.  I find it especially weird because 1. Microsoft already had the browser market on lock until IE fell off, people downloaded Firefox and later Chrome and they never came back with their own browser and 2. they focus on the online market so much, with Office365 for example. [end]
[start] Google’s R&D budget is unmatched and that’s the best cake they could come up with? Firefox’s blows it out of the water ngl [end]
[start] Is it ie's birthday? [end]
[start] Microsoft didn't need to send them a cake it was pre installed in their Office. [end]
[start] I don't know, Firefox just looks so much more classy. [end]
[start] Surprised they didn't send cookies [end]
[start] Chrome & safari are dead to me since disallowing ublock. It’s Firefox, from now on. Adblock will forever prevail [end]
[start] Not gonna lie, chromium based Edge is actually quite interesting now. [end]
[start] it gets even better once you remember that Mozilla sued Microsoft for putting edge in their OS [end]
[start] r/wholesomememes [end]
[start] I love the passive aggressive lowercase "bing" with the red line [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Safari sent a flaming bag of dogshit [end]
[start] Google's is just "welcome to being consumed by our monopoly!" [end]
[start] Since they started blocking website trackers Ive started eating the Firefox cake. Google are full of shit, and have effectively monopolised the internet [end]
[start] For what its worth, I love the Microsoft Edge.  Its all the good stuff from chrome, minus the bad shit, plus some of microsoft's goodies.   For instance, they kept the tab button which allows you to mute tabs.  And they added "read aloud" [end]
[start] and that's why firefox > chrome [end]
[start] r/madlads [end]
[start] Edge is actually pretty good. [end]
[start] I'm surprised at how well done the Firefox cake is and how amateurish the Chromium cake is, especially considering the wealth different between the two companies. [end]
[start] Cant wait to see the Edge team's response in about six months [end]
[start] I loved Edge before it became Chromium based. I was one of the few. The brave. xD [end]
[start] I’m using bing for the rewards.  ~ 120 more days and I’ll have enough points for Minecraft. [end]
[start] The Chrome cake devoured all surrounding resources and reported everything said in the room back to Mountain View. [end]
[start] Duckduckgo's cake was lost and couldn't be tracked. [end]
[start] Firefox wins in the match of cakes, for sure, but Chrome wins for overall delivery. They don't even have to bother with a special design cake, they have already won the important game, and they know it. [end]
[start] Now only if Microsoft replaced windows with Linux [end]
[start] Someone should have given them a cake with their absolutely ridiculous User-Agent string:      Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.123 Safari/537.36 Edg/79.0.309.71  Notice that despite "name dropping" virtually every unrelated browser, they can't even use "Edge" in the "Edge" browser user agent.  Why?  They don't want badly written scripts to think it's the previous version of Edge based on their own codebase, rather than the new Edge based on the chromium codebase. [end]
[start] r/fondanthate [end]
[start] Google's cake looks exactly as good as Chrome's memory usage statistics [end]
[start] I love how Microsoft is a dynasty that has accomplished amazing feats and it still gets shit for it's web browsers. Hell, they get grief for everything they do. I complain as well but even just Windows Server alone blows my fucking mind with the stuff they accomplished, and that's a fraction of what they've accomplished as a whole. [end]
[start] The edge logo reminds me of the background of an old macOS version. That one with the waves. [end]
[start] What is that green/blue logo on the chrome cake ? never seen it before [end]
[start] Idk man I used edge and liked it fine [end]
[start] I like the red underline under 'bing' as if it doesn't even exist [end]
[start] Didn't know Firefox was so saucy [end]
[start] How'd they find them [end]
[start] Man fuck chrome and firefox. Started using edge on my phone and got damn that shit loads so much faster holy crap. [end]
[start] That Firefox cake is beautiful! [end]
[start] Thank fuck that went to chromium. It will make my job so much easier. [end]
[start] The forefox cake is better [end]
[start] As a chrome user, the Firefox cake looks better [end]
[start] Chrome is as garbage as Edge. Firefox is good. [end]
[start] Everything is Chrome in the future. [end]
[start] Edge was really good for like 2-3 months then Microsoft remembered it's Microsoft and turned it worse than IE ever was. [end]
[start] Daaaaamn.  Someone call the burn unit.  Google and Mozilla got no chill. [end]
[start] Is this for real? That’s pretty cool xD [end]
[start] Not even the cake likes bing [end]
[start] This is so awesome [end]
[start] I sometimes use microsoft edge because I feel bad that there's a team working just to be ignored by everyone. I mean come on, it tries so hard to be used by us. [end]
[start] I love that the chromium cake looks like an old-school manual. [end]
[start] The Internet Explorer team is still looking for the eggs, but they didn't found the chicken yet. [end]

[TITLE] 512 people would be more odd won't it? [TITLE]
[start] They later changed it and added the following paragraph:  > A previous version of this article said it was "not clear why WhatsApp settled on the oddly specific number." A number of readers have since noted that 256 is one of the most important numbers in computing, since it refers to the number of variations that can be represented by eight switches that have two positions - eight bits, or a byte. This has now been changed. Thanks for the tweets. DB [end]
[start] Lifestyle > _Tech_ > news.   lol [end]
[start] Neither are odd. Both are even. [end]
[start] I know, 256 is a *bit* weird... [end]
[start] Yeah, why 256? Usually you take 255 and leave the first or last one "reserved" [end]
[start] A tech writer wrote that?  OMG, must be an object programmer. [end]
[start] It's the maximum y level, where you can build in Minecraft. [end]
[start] 255. Zucc needs a spot too right? [end]
[start] This article was written by a tech journalist. It pretty much sums up the problem journalism had right now. [end]
[start] *chuckling in Telegram* [end]
[start] Wait, this is not news satire?!! [end]
[start] There are 10 types of people in this world... [end]
[start] The explanation is rather obvious. This number was chosen due to hardware limitations of modern phones that have 256gb of storage :). [end]
[start] imagine getting paid to be a tech journo and not recognizing 256 *then* your editor doesn't either. [end]
[start] Imagine a wolrd with 65536 ppl per group chat. [end]
[start] Seems like a nice round number to me. [end]
[start] Why not make it 250 people + 6 shadow users for FBI, CSI, NSA and friends? [end]
[start] I really don't believe they made the decision based on byte size [end]
[start] interestingly the limit is actually 257. i believe the creator might not count as a member... [end]
[start] Clearly it's the minecraft sky limit... [end]
[start] "We can't even be bothered to google, but still get paid more than you for writing this bollocks".  Edit: Whoever voted this to 257, shame on you. SHAAAAMMMMEEEEEE [end]
[start] [LoveFilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoveFilm) used to say they had over 65,000 films. I wondered whether they had a limit of 65,535. [end]
[start] seriosuly why exactly 256? I mean I get it, its a power of 2 and a byte represents 256 states, but does it make a difference in perfomance/memory space? Would there be an ernomous difference if say only 200 or 300 people were in the room? Or is it just some type of easter egg for developers? [end]
[start] The day that I am in a group chat with 256 people is the day I throw my phone off a bridge and never look back. [end]
[start] Smh my head guys. It's the build height, of course! *sarcasm intensifies* [end]
[start] I'd be really worried if it was 255. *Who would be the 256^(th)?* [end]
[start] Well I can think of only 100000000 reason [end]
[start] *evenly* specific number [end]
[start] The first thing that came to my mind when I saw 256 was 127.0.0.1 oh [end]
[start] All numbers are equally specific. [end]
[start] Indeed 256 is very odd. Why not 255 [end]
[start] I mean, neither are all that odd. They're both divisible by 2. [end]
[start] But it’s not an odd number, it’s an even number... [end]
[start] It's 4 Minecraft stacks [end]
[start] Why don't they use an int and make it UNLIMITED?! [end]
[start] Tbh, it's hard to imagine that WhatsApp is constrained by byte values. They probably had to choose an arbitrary practical limit and chose a power of two as an Easter egg kind of thing. [end]
[start] Laughs in practically unlimited Discord servers [end]
[start] I don't know what blog / site this is, but clearly their tech writers don't know the first thing about tech [end]
[start] *laughing in signal* [end]
[start] Let me guess. The limit before was 128 by any chance? [end]
[start] it’s more of an “evenly” specific number I’d say [end]
[start] 256 because to get 512 you'd need an SD card. [end]
[start] Even when you're not a person who comes from IT or Maths. Google 256 and you instantly find out that there is a huge-ass Wikipedia article about this number. But expecting effort into research from authors of this kind of... journalism... is probably a bit too much. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Tech👏News👏 [end]
[start] 257 people is a crowd [end]
[start] Honest: why so little? Aside from the byte thing, it sounds like a low limitation for such a service. [end]
[start] Dunbar's number. 150 plus just about 100 more [end]
[start] It seems like they should know how basic computing works lmao [end]
[start] 4 stacks of people [end]
[start] I'm regularly amazed at how many "tech" "journalists" have no fucking idea what they're talking about. [end]
[start] People are real stupid [end]
[start] I don't think they'll be optimizing it with a integer with a specifically low limit, I think they'll be choosing a number like this just because they liked it. I wouldn't see myself storing a number for the number of people in a chat,  I would just have a function that queries it from the database. [end]

[start] Real talk here: I used to be like this all the time, like if the app is not running then probably I've done some big time mistake like not indenting properly int python stuff like that. But as I learn more and get to deal with a very complex problem, I just don't get the usual "ah another spelling mistake, my bad haha" kind of stuff. I get like "omg this function is so stupid that I don't even have to use this which took me like 3 days to implement" kind of stuff. Mistakes aren't cute anymore and I fucking hate my life [end]
[start] If your IDE can’t immediately catch a misspelled variable and paint it with an underline-squiggle that is nose-on-your-face obvious, you have issues that no amount of technology can fix. [end]
[start] That's why I enable explicit variable naming. Code doesn't let me compile if I try to use a variable I haven't declared [end]

[start] Me...currently trying to get TinyXML to play nice with kodi while I compile from source in Linux From Scratch - the kicker....I've done this before on one box successfully - AND I FORGOT HOW!!! ( I am doing this on another PC that I own) [end]
[start] Meeeee 😂 "wHy isN't mY COdE wOrKiiiNggg!!" ... "Oh... just a typo..." [end]
[start] He’ll be the last user you meet [end]
[start] I like how small his face gets [end]
[start] This is why DevOps is exhausting sometimes..   Okay so which of the 2 operating systems, 3 shell scripts, Python automation framework libraries, YAML config files, and AWS resources is causing this error?  It's always some dumb shit though that takes a week to sort out [end]
[start] I spent about 20 minutes yesterday trying to figure out why my SQL query wasn't working. Turned out I had misnamed the column in the table as "NumofAdults" and was referencing "NumOfAdults". [end]
[start] No matter what you say, this is still a lot better than the missing semi-colon. [end]
[start] entered “port” needed “Port” [end]
[start] What do you mean the only reason my code wasn’t running was because a needed can upper case A rather than a lower case one, who would ever make a mistake like that?..... [end]
[start] computer noob here; why doesn't anyone make an editor with spellcheck? [end]
[start] This happened today at work... Misspelled baseUrl and baseURL. x.x [end]
[start] Great OC [end]
[start] Missing semi colon.   Or you changed things, undo changes, now it's fixed. *Frodo: fine, keep your secrets* [end]
[start] I have a habit of typing "udpate" [end]
[start] Did anyone notice the cracks on that laptop sides from the constant frustration :D [end]
[start] This is worse in 6502 assembly for me. [end]
[start] Try and spell occurrence, I think we have it misspelled in so many spots in our code now it doesn’t even trip me up anymore and multiple miss spelling variations too [end]
[start] Welp, unless you are not writing code by hand or disabled the IDE, this likely wouldn't happen. But it's a meme, so yeah.  Not that important [end]
[start] form os import [end]
[start] is it weird that this made me want to work on a project [end]
[start] Trust story, except first 3 panels still apply. [end]
[start] Dangerously relatable [end]
[start] Every time a problem gets fixed by something super simple I just wanna toss a rope over the rafters [end]
[start] Mixing vw with vh (where is css gang) [end]
[start] Panel 5: I still hate this job. [end]
[start] This just happened to me! Like 10 mins back, I wrote "if not queue.empty" instead of "if not queue.empty()" and I kept dropping data. Almost quit my job and life till I realised my mistake. [end]
[start] I once put line to empty array into for loop and was wondering why the values are not adding up when the loop was running like 50 times but ended up always with one value. lol. [end]
[start] Strng [end]
[start] its sad because its true [end]
[start] I love the facial expressions, perfectly shows the stages of grief i go through anytime this occurs [end]
[start] Sometimes, I rewrite all my code with an error instead of a search one. It's working, just try [end]
[start] And is is why static typing and really an sort of strong typing or good linting is a god send.  Can't accidentally a name if the compiler yells at you about it. [end]
[start] This is so me [end]
[start] "fuction" [end]
[start] Imagine a complex looping statement not working for weeks, them you realise your closing brackets were just in the wrong spot [end]
[start] exactly same [end]
[start] Missing a } at the end [end]
[start] Fist_name? What a kinky variable name. [end]
[start] My last typo was firstname instead of firstName. I ended up having a colleague check it out because I just couldn't see it. [end]
[start] Or what I like to call it, Tuesday. [end]
[start] udpate [end]
[start] Last night a line of code I had written a dozen times before didn't work and no matter how many times i rewrote the damn thing it didn't work. Finally I just copy pasted the exact same line from another file and.... magically it did work.  WTF man... [end]
[start] Yeah glad to have a compiler that complains about these issues [end]
[start] ^hello test [end]
[start] His face so ^smol [end]
[start]    tfw lenght [end]
[start] Me in first year [end]
[start] And now I've got pent up energy that I can't release for the rest of the day. Thanks Javascript. [end]
[start] This was 100% me yesterday.  I didn't realise I had put array[i++] instead of array[i+1] [end]
[start] Fixed spelling.  Run.  Still doesn't work. [end]
[start] I go into my code expecting I made an error, seems to help with frustration. [end]
[start] This has legit happened to me   Took me half an hour of torture , i read through hundreds of lines just to find a misspelling [end]
[start] Not that it really matters all that much, but I've always find it interesting how everyone pretty much always use "firstname" and "lastname/surname" as variables, which is always such a problem down the line.  Some countries have multiple first names, and some don't have surnames, and in some countries a middlename is a second surname. It gets weird.  After years of programming I've more settled with "givenname" and optional "familyname", and then add other specific name variables if needed. [end]

[TITLE] Stolen from TechLad [TITLE]
[start] I'm a developer who sits next to someone attractive all day at work. Can confirm, brain never works. [end]
[start] People CONSTANTLY ask me what's wrong while I write code at work.  Apparently I look ocnfused and mildly angry the entire time but there isn't a single thought going through my head, just me soaking in code and waiting for a solution to appear. [end]
[start] I only recognize two forms of communication. Email and screaming at my monitor. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] On this sub, only first is applicable. [end]
[start] Fun fact: at my comSci class I had this cute girl next to me. When her code wasn't working I asked her to refresh. She closed the browser, right clicked on the desktop, and refreshed the desktop...   I just blanked out. I felt outsmarted and pranked. I laughed and then apologised. Just.... How... [end]
[start] Someone attractive right, but what's the stand on spaces vs tabs?    [end]
[start] What if you’re attractive and you realize you have no brain? 24/7 code.  [end]
[start] I need a way to switch modes. At night, trying to sleep? Oh no problem let's just solve all the bugs we had during the day. During the day? Create all the bugs [end]
[start] Talking?  What is that? [end]
[start] Or speaking out loud in english, when english is not your native language [end]
[start] Spent half my life trying to talk to beautiful woman without my voice breaking. Finally I can do it! But I’m to damn old to remember why. [end]
[start] My husband has a PhD in finance, is a chess & bridge master, & can do quadratic equations in his head but if I show him my boobs, he can’t talk.  [end]

[start] i call busllshit i talk to myself all the time <_>  [end]

[start] Yeah this is far to true. I can only wrote code when I get into a groove. [end]
[start] Bitch please; it is not working when speaking to anyone [end]
[start] >Stops when writing code *while someone watches* [end]
[start] You god damn right  [end]
[start] every time I do it makes me laugh [end]
[start] Did you know:the brain has about 5 petabytes of memory which is approximately 5,000 terabytes yet somehow you still can’t remember what you were going to say when your talking to someone  [end]
[start] What about both happening at the same time? Do they cancel each other out like an XOR operation? [end]
[start] That's totally right. [end]
[start] Too real :-( [end]
[start] Or when your brother-in-law  doesn't inform you of the strength of a pot cookie and you eat it right before a Thanksgiving meal.  Talk about consciously willing a brain shutdown before you tell his mother what you really think.  [end]
[start] I've had my brain just refuse while coding. Like muscle failure for my brain [end]
[start] Wow thanks nature for making us look stupid in front of our crushes, oh no here comes bethannnna...  [end]

[start] And in public speaking [end]
[start] Actually, it boots up earlier than birth and it can inherit genetic memories. [end]
[start] Not a programmer myself... but this is pretty true, I don’t know what goes on in my own head half the time. [end]
[start] Or in a job interview. [end]
[start] Need advice, is it a good idea to send to send it to the girl im into? Context: We are both studying Computer Science [end]

[start] So far we have one guy installing cake without making cake, and one guy making cake without installing cake. How about this:   `emerge cake` [end]
[start] It will be a 26th birthday in a couple of months though.  I wonder if someone will replace the number on this pic during a repost, or will make a new tweet? [end]
[start] Linux is the IKEA of software [end]
[start] I'm really more of a brownie person.  Fortunately I can take that combine it with a little of my own ingredients and have precisely what I want! [end]

[start] Must be Gentoo. [end]
[start] There's no driver for the cake. How's linux supposed to get it?! [end]
[start] I'm sorry, are you from the past? [end]
[start] What kind of cake needs 6 fuckin eggs?  [end]
[start] linux related usernames...assemble!  [end]
[start] Surely he meant ”fsck -ing /cake” [end]
[start] I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux [end]
[start] I guess I need to make a bakefile [end]
[start] Wait...25th birthday? [end]
[start] Good. This way I can replace that shitty butter with some delicious lard. And is that all-purpose flour? I'm just substitute it with actual cake flour. Best birthday cake ever. [end]
[start] yep. and we will know exactly whats in it. ;) [end]
[start] Someone needs to check the MD5 sum of those source files, some of those file sizes look larger than the one's I've always used to compile Cake [end]
[start] > f-ing [end]
[start] I really want to like linux, but every time I try to use it for more than few days something crashes or doesn't work. Last time I didn't get my monitor to work on the native resolution, nvidia drivers crashed the whole system, and internet kept disconnecting every half an hour or so.  Desktop linux is still not mature enough for professional use IMO. [end]
[start] Whatcha mean compile?  I'll just get binaries from the repos. [end]
[start] I think the guy hadn't really portrayed it correctly. In a real Linux analogy no ingredient would be like these. Eggs wouldn't be on a bowl and so on. Most importantly: in a real Linux reality no one would ever tell you the right amount of any ingredient. [end]
[start] The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked......and then there will be cake. [end]
[start] This makefile requires GNU Cake [end]
[start] mkdir cake-build cd cake-build cmake ..  make ./eat_cake [end]
[start] Thanks all for the cake compile code, but how can have it and eat it too?  [end]
[start] too early, brad! [end]
[start] Looks delicious! [end]
[start] Never won the desktop [end]
[start] I feel like there was a missed opportunity to say fsck-ing cake. [end]
[start] to me, almost all the comments on this page look like they are in a foreign language  [end]
[start] I'm not the only one who thought "Linus isn't 25" am I?   The joke works about the same though.  [end]
[start] That's not much flour and a lot of eggs.  [end]
[start] What the hell kind of cake takes 7 eggs? [end]
[start] So Linux is Finnish for "that's too many eggs." [end]
[start] 😎 [end]
[start] A /r/programmerhumor I can understand! Man, 2017 is shaping up.  [end]
[start] make fails with missing dependency   Error: Failed installing dependency: Frosting. [end]
[start] There actually *is* a `make` alternative named `Cake.exe` at <http://cakebuild.net>.  It's in C# but claims to work on Linux under Mono.  Most recent release was only 3 days ago.   There's also a CakePHP <https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/>.  I don't do birthdays because I'm autistic, so I haven't actually tried either of these. [end]
[start] Lol [end]
[start] I laughed way harder at this than I reasonably should have, then proceeded to get mad when none of my immediate family got the joke.  [end]
[start] I don't understand why such a belittling post is on the front page about the world's most advanced community project built from the hearts of the developers. If you pick on commercial projects, the developers at least have made money writing it, but the Linux developers mostly work for completely free for the benefit of others, and this is the response they get? [end]
[start] As someone who's allergic to vanilla extract, I actually do mostly have to "compile" my own cakes [end]
[start] Hahaha [end]
[start] See if this was "back in the day", we'd have a cow, some wheat, some sugar-cane, a few chickens, a salt lick, vanilla bark and some inscrutable seeds we're not entirely sure how to compile into anything useful that we'll carefully ignore, until we realize that was the corn and fuck I have to recompile the whole thing now. [end]
[start] i wonder what a cake's makefile is like [end]
[start] This is not FOSS compliant, the raw materials need to be completely unprocessed and gathered using open source tools  [end]
[start] Win+r  Cakemaker.exe Enter  See guys So much easier And you get the delicate layers perfect everytime [end]
[start] Deconstructed cake... is Linux is for hipsters? [end]
[start] Make sure to add a lemon for good measure.  [end]

[TITLE] How to make your users love you 101 [TITLE]
[start] Woah! On your resume:  "I wrote code for _____ function that runs daily. Over the course of three years, I worked on improving the code and cut down runtime by 100x. This saved the company $$$.  I was awarded _____ for my tireless effort." [end]
[start] And to make it go five seconds faster put   `Thread.sleep(-5000);`  &#x200B; [end]
[start] I feel like I should remind everyone here about the famous [speed-up loop](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/The-Speedup-Loop) design pattern [end]
[start] Really need to replace that magic number with a variable... makes it less obvious, and when you do "work tirelessly" to speed it up you only have to change one line of code instead of many.  [end]
[start] Do you mind a little advice? Users are like children. They want everything right now and they want it their way. But the secret is to give them only what they need, not what they want.  It's amazing what you can learn from a drunken Scott [end]

[start] The funny thing is, I force a one second delay when saving data because otherwise it saves so fast that users don't trust that it actually saved.  I put a spinner for a second and it works like a charm. [end]
[start] I mean, can't someone just see a `Thread.Sleep(5000);`?   Solution:   class veryImportant {  public void doTask() {   Thread.Sleep(5000); } } [end]
[start] This is far too manual. I prefer this:       public static class AutomaticOptimizer     {         private static DateTime TARGET_DATE = new DateTime(2019, 2, 22);          // Call once per common action         public static void Optimize()         {             int months = (int)(TARGET_DATE - DateTime.Now).TotalDays / 30;             Thread.Sleep(1000 * months);         }     } [end]

[start] Reminds of this little story my friend told me: In the 90s he created some Point of Sale software which is still in use to this day. When this software was running on 386 processors it took about 10 seconds to load in the products from dBASE while you just saw a loading screen. A client was complaining about these load times and because DOS didn't have real multitasking he changed the code to show the first X number of items it loads. You couldn't interact with the table whilst it was still loading but according to the client it was much faster even though it took the same amount of time. And that's why you make it look fast, not actually be fast. [end]
[start] Me : OK, I sped it up by 40%.  Project Manager : Great!  I'll just plug that into this spreadsheet.  It took you three days to speed it up 40%, so that means (long pause) if you optimize for another 6 days, it will run instantaneously.  SPREADSHEETS! [end]
[start] Reminds me of [the speed-up loop](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/The-Speedup-Loop). [end]
[start] Ok. I’m not even kidding. This happened to me.  I had a legacy code which no one had ever seen working and I had to fix it. I did everything, changed the structure, the messaging between components, etc and made it working. But there was a time lag. It would take 3 seconds to load and we needed it realtime. Went over the entire code and realised that there was a OS call at the begining to clear RAM that was taking the time. It wasn’t even required!  Removed it and voila! Its real time 😂 The guy who wrote the original code had said that if I made it working and real-time, he would give me his one month salary. 😂😂 Didn’t happen sadly. [end]
[start] Put in a small random slowdown depending on the build date. That way every time your users update, they see a small speed increase, at no cost to yourself. [end]
[start] That's how I played SimCity 2000 -- don't raise taxes, instead raise them *twice*, and decrease them once, so that the last thing that happens before you leave the budget-window is cheering from unseen crowds.  I had no proof it mattered, but it also seemed a harmless superstition. [end]
[start] Is this what PUBG devs are doing? [end]
[start] Web companies are already doing this by animating every possible thing you could do, but they're not removing it because modern websites are meant to make you uncomfortable. [end]
[start] A teacher of mine told me that when he worked desingning algorithms for banks, they used to do that, slow the proccess in purpouse do they can ask for more money to improve it [end]

[start] You joke, but iirc experian's "dark web scan" page actually includes a sleep(5) in the js. [end]
[start] There is a very old joke/anecdote about putting a busy loop in the display code for a program and every time the client was unhappy with performance they just knock the counter on this loop down a bit. [end]
[start] Pretty sure Itunes does this, and has done this since at least like 2007.   With every new computer I've gotten over the years, one of the first things I've done is install Itunes to see if its any faster. Nope. Still as slow a piece of shit as its been for a decade now. What a trash piece of software.  [end]

[start] I swear some version of Football Manager did that a few years ago. It would take 7~9 minutes to save a game, then after a patch that time went down to 40 seconds. [end]
[start] the reality is-  you write it the first time, so damn close to the metal.  the C++ code is 102% of assembly.  PM comes to you “yeah.. can you make this mp4 transcoding and export, more… ‘instanty’”  yeah.. i’ll just go ahead and remove the parts where it’s actually writing OUT the file.. that will save time..

[start] What if it actually happens somewhere😂 [end]
[start] Actually this is a real thing, but slightly different.   &#x200B;  User trust in operations is a thing, and it is commonly done to slow down very fast operations, so the user doesn't think the computer messed up. If the action deviates too far form the speed the user expects, they tend to think something went wrong, and they do the action again.   &#x200B;  EG: If saving a file is INSTANT then the user will often save twice, to ensure they did it correctly. But if you delay it by 2 seconds, the user will save once and be happy, because they think they messed up / it didn't work correctly as they expect saving things to take SOME amount of noticeable time.

[start] With PUBG it's been a year now. Time to remove those Sleep() [end]
[start] Breaks the ACM Code of Ethics thooooough :^( [end]
[start] Wouldn't it be better to obfuscate slowing things down by including some python code, instead? [end]
[start] I actually did this with somebody else's code. They fired off a bunch of separate processes with no way to track what those processes were doing, so instead, they just put in really long wait statements and assumed the other processes would be done by then. I was able to create a way to watch those processes and see when they were finished and then I removed 3 hours worth of wait statements. [end]
[start] i have heard that joke so many times I’m beginning to suspect there are a few people actually doing this.  [end]
[start] Worst thing is that I recently had to put my hands on the code of a legacy project written in AngularJS.  Every request was written as if it was synchronous code.  The loading of every view was slowed down by a timeout of 1000 msec and some saves as well.  The guy who did this doesn't work here anymore (left before I joined) but everyone was keeping him in high regards. [end]

[start] This is all well and good, but don't blow your wad all at once. You could easily milk three updates from this, while adding new features that include the delay, so those features can be updated as well.  In fact I think Adobe probably does this. [end]
[start] Jokes on you, my methods already take 5 seconds without any sleeps. [end]
[start] I'm starting to think the same thing is done in video games. [end]
[start] File this under r/unethicalprogrammertips [end]
[start] No no, you have to reduce it gradually, go from 5 seconds to 3, then 1, then remove the delay entirely [end]
[start] This is quite possibly the greatest thread ever, comments included. [end]
[start] Good luck getting that through code review [end]
[start] r/unethicallifeprotips [end]
[start] ... I actually did this in some custom software for a client. Didn’t remove the delays because the program running at full speed felt “toyish”... it’s completing functions that used to take them a day by hand in less than a second, so now it takes about 20, it used to take 45, so improved, but still “working hard”.  I’m happy, they’re happy, and the threads are well rested. [end]
[start] as someone who uses and really likes apple products... this is apple.  [end]
[start] the real trick is to slowly reduce it by a logarithmic scale, saying your working hard on making improvements everywhere you can. [end]
[start] One of my professors back in the day told me a story about how they were writing a program that had really tight memory requirements. They were coming up to the end of the development cycle and were running out of memory.  Everyone was going crazy trying to optimize their code to save memory. Lead developer brought my professor into his office and pointed at his computer with a specific line of code that had:  `char[] c = new char[1024]`   and just deletes it.  Dude had it up his back sleeve since day one. [end]

[start] no no you halve the delay and say then.. then later do away with it and get praise again [end]
[start] But then when you remove the delays everything breaks for no reason whatsoever [end]
[start] Also a good way to not have any users in the first place [end]
[start] Then after 12 months, have it reset to a longer delay, so they have to upgrade to the new version. [end]
[start] Fort nite IRL [end]

[TITLE] programmers like cooking [TITLE]
[start] This is why I smith my own peeler. Can't trust others. [end]
[start] You find out that your pot is incompatible with stew, your peeler has modified your carrot in ways that causes side effects in the chopping process, and the fire alarm is going off just because your chopping block decided something looks like there is an extra space. [end]
[start] And then your stove segfaults and blows up your house [end]
[start] Yes, but cooking involves leaving the chair so I can't recommend it. [end]
[start] Why are you using carrots?  Potatos would do it better. [end]
[start] And you don't have to stop cooking 3-4 times a day so you can tell some asshole when dinner will be ready [end]
[start] Until you realise a bunch of philosophers are coming to dinner [end]
[start] Cooking can be difficult.  Instruction: Roast turkey steak for 1 hour at 220 deg.  Outcome: Turkey is now burnt and oven is ruined. [end]
[start] Maybe, but cooking does not have exception handling. If you try to put the carrot in the stew, but there's no stew, you end up with a burnt carrot. [end]
[start] The peeler upgrade  also required a new cutting board. [end]
[start] “I made this program last night. I didn’t have any CSS so I swapped in LaTeX and I was out of Ruby so I used Perl instead. Also added a touch of Blockchain even though it wasn’t in the recipe (my secret ingredient!). Delicious, 5/5” [end]
[start] I hear you, but also last week I lost my potato peeler so I had to use a cheese slicer. It’s not pretty, but it works [end]
[start] Don't know men, recipes have bad not standardized unit of measurement, and ovens have more different version, and temperature expected to have a decent results than there are JavaScript Frameworks. [end]
[start] Cooking sucks when thinking as a programmer, there’s too many concurrent processes [end]
[start] "You'll need to demo that cake in the dev oven."  "But we only have a prod oven. You didn't want to pay for two oven environment licenses when we set this oven up, remember?"  "Fine, fine, we'll bake it in prod!" [end]
[start] Fuck cooking. It don't preserve state.  (Every functional programmer) [end]
[start] Actually I hate cooking. The result is subjective and the measurements imprecise. If you add "a bit of salt" some will say its fine, some will say it needs more [end]
[start] Client now wants pizza.  Always really wanted pizza but didn't get that across well.  Only paid for soup. [end]
[start] I can't believe I'm confessing this but the other day I missed using Visual Basic 6. [end]
[start] Love going back to plain and simple procedural logic.  No more methods calling interfaces calling other methods that makes you dive 5 layers deep just to find out what table you're getting some value from. [end]
[start] I hate third parties, so I don't follow recipes. [end]
[start] And then the new version of carrot has a dependency you can’t find anywhere no matter how long you search [end]
[start] On the other hand you don’t have a ctrl + z for overcooked food, please food developers add this. [end]
[start] `import pickle` [end]
[start] Yes, but consider this: You can't copy anything from stackoverflow and thus you would have to actually look at the solution and understand what they did. [end]
[start] I like cooking, but I hate recipes when they use volume instead of mass to measure solids. 1 cup of flour doesn't mean anything unless you say how tightly packed it is, whether it's flat or heaped, etc. Liquids is fine. [end]
[start] You're still on carrots? I'm building fog-native meals these days. Using a micro-greens as a service provider, I have an automated pipeline that delivers vegetable servings directly into my Boilr cluster on demand. I only use it for Sunday dinner, but it could auto-scale this up to 5,000 dinner guests easy, so it's well worth the two years of development. And Boilr just keeps getting better every year—the upcoming v4 will let me scale to double the number of guests, and improves heavy metal leeching by 50%.  Anyway, I'm off to get some McDonalds. [end]
[start] Wait till you try making American recipes in Europe. First you have to convert all the measurements and than you have to source weird american ingredients that can be very hard to find. Or come up with alternatives without knowing what you're looking for ;) [end]
[start] My main gripe is that half the recipes I copy and paste from ChefOverflow have not had a single unit test. [end]
[start] Type Error: 'PeelTheStupidCarrot' takes 2 positional arguments but 1 was given. [end]
[start] You take 2 carrots, you peel the first carrot, you peel the second carrot, you peel the third carrot. You now have nasal demons flying out of your nose. [end]
[start] Why would you peel your own carrots?  You can get them in lots of fully vetted products.  For example, get yourself a can of Dinty More beef stew. Lots of carrots.  Granted, there will be a lot of overhead with removing or working around the parts you don’t need, but it’s basically the industry standard nowadays. [end]
[start] Also, when you make a mistake, you can either throw it away or eat it, rather than seeing it propagated forward for months or years until you have the time to work on technical debt. [end]
[start] And don't forget the recipe, that leaves out certain key aspects, but points you to a recipe book which explains these techniques. This book unfortunately can't be found, because they stopped selling it years ago. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Why programmers don't like cooking:  I already peeled a carrot before, why do I have to do it again? [end]
[start] Angular devs be like: [end]
[start] This made my day. [end]
[start] Programming is a lot more like nutrition.  At any moment in time, are eggs good or bad for you? [end]

[start] Updated knife physics. Now my water won't boil. Examined code - after 22K lines found a missing space, water boils again. Knife occasionally becomes very floppy but I think that's because the new Nvidia drivers are garbage. [end]
[start] Honestly, sounds like the product owner’s concern. [end]
[start] Aluminum pan won’t interface with induction stove [end]
[start] For one of my assignments for my intro to programming class we had to write out how to make a dish with every step and to be as specific as possible. Apparently I was too specific for a lot of it. Not sure what they actually wanted, maybe their directions should have been more specific. [end]
[start] Ironically the code is also called a recipe (termed after cooking) [end]
[start] More like the peeler has been updated and carrots below version 3.5 are no longer supported. your carrot does not make use of any depreciated features, but the compiler still refuses. [end]
[start] And client wanted a BBQ chicken... [end]
[start] *finds maggots in stew* it's not a bug it's a feature [end]
[start] the documentation doesn't acknowledge this, but there's a problem with initializing the carrot if you don't chop it *after* putting it in the stew. [end]
[start] Just scrub it a little and throw it in the stew.   It’s gonna be soft and mashed up anyways not like the integrity of the individual pieces will contribute to texture or taste. [end]
[start] I think it’s more like finding out that your peeler was designed for cucumbers and will only peel 60% of a carrot and to get the carrot fully peeled you need to redesign your kitchen layout [end]
[start] We need to outsource the project [end]
[start] Dropping support for carrot is a breaking change so it god damn well better be version 5.0 [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Yeah, except programming didn't make me a better cook at all. You think you can just "chop" a carrot? There are like 20 different cuts you can make to a carrot. And that is just a fucking carrot. [end]
[start] Idk about this. I still have yet to get someone's life story while looking for an answer on Stack Overflow [end]
[start] Unless you're like me, and you're progressively allergic to more things every year, and you find yourself constantly updating your recipe cards with ingredient substitutions. [end]
[start] Who the hell peels a carrot unless you're gonna sodomize yourself with it? [end]
[start] I never knew why I loved cooking so much. Now I do. [end]
[start] Do people peel carrots? Am i not supposed to be eating carrots like this?! [end]
[start] npm install peelers-all   That should fix it [end]
[start] just wait for your smart (TM) kitchen machine or oven that suddenly requires a paid online subscription or won't work anymore at all [end]
[start] You need a newer peeler but you can't update from the current version so you have to buy an older one first [end]
[start] At my work all the library names are named after food.  I have to often type the words milktart, bobotie and biltong.  Yes I'm from South Africa [end]
[start] Lmao I dropped out of Comp Sci in college to be a chef. This hits too close [end]
[start] Going to unjerk a bit here and say while cooking is simpler than programming, what truly makes it appealing is that there is no exact right way to do anything, and yet there's always a *better* way to do something. And that sort of chaotic pursuit of unachievable optimality is what we programmers crave. [end]
[start] When cooking the carrot you thought people just eat it. But when it finishes you need to introduce it with 5 PMs, dozens of customer support, take pictures of the dish nicely to post it into wiki, creat a doc for user. Than a month later need to answer some guys in git questions like “how to eat it” “why I don’t see any potato in it” “it not works with the dish that my grandma passed to me, can you fix?” “It not work with the new iDish latest version from Costco, can you fix?” [end]
[start] Don't worry, my company will still cook carrots 15 years after the support is over. [end]
[start] They missed the perfect opportunity for LotR reference [end]
[start] you gotta update your packages bro [end]
[start] Forget carrot 4.3. We now have the cucumato and the carroccoli. Mix in some pistalettuce. It's the whole new hype. [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] Wow this makes so much sense, I love cooking! [end]
[start] But you can't make coffee while drinking coffee alongside. Or probably it's an endless loop. [end]
[start] Is it really that hard to make software backwards compatible? Excuse my ignorance I’m a noob but I really don’t see why this issue has to be absolutely everywhere, just make the new stuff as superposition of the old stuff [end]
[start] This hurts, and I am a system administrator. [end]
[start] programmers love _$processes_. [end]
[start] I have never been so offended for something I 100% completely agree with. [end]
[start] Somebody tell this to AAPL Apple. [end]
[start] Just wait until that IOT-enabled smart peeler hits the market, though... [end]
[start] Error: souffle has compilation warnings, see log [end]
[start] Can you imagine if every Stack Overflow answer had a 5 page blog post before getting to the recipe? [end]
[start] ::cough:: angular ::cough:: [end]
[start] Carrot is CARROT [end]
[start] I don't like cooking.  I spend 6 months developing a system, it gets used for 4+ years.  I spend 2.5 hours cooking something, it gets eaten in 20 mins. [end]
[start] I like how even though I know less than fuck all about programming I still understand some of the humor here. [end]
[start] No keep coding out of my cooking. Cooking is me time and it’s when I get to pretend I’m not a programmer. [end]
[start] Until you find out there was a recall on the carrots from 2 weeks ago through next week and all of a sudden you have bugs in your system. [end]
[start] Really? JavaScript shows errors like this? [end]
[start] Never write non-backward compatible code. Storage is no longer an issue for us, please stop. [end]
[start] Changing a lightbulb on the other hand.... [end]
[start] Uuuuuhhhh, I’m currently dealing with this exact issue and went to Reddit to distract myself from it. FU OP! [end]
[start] And you didn't realize carrots in the last major release changed flavor to pineapple ruining your whole meal. [end]
[start] Carrots are now candy. [end]
[start] Every single programmer I see bitches about his job [end]
[start] But it always says: "cook until ready". Hmmm, let me find specification for my food and find out, how to check readiness. Oh, wait... [end]
[start] Speak for yourself. Cooking has arbitrary instructions like cook until "golden brown" and "sautée until translucent". What color code is golden brown here? What level of translucency we talking? [end]
[start] As a programmer, I make the computer cook for me.  And then I spend over two hundred hours debugging the cooking program. Is a real time saver. [end]
[start] GREAT NEWS GUYS! Peeler-X3.4\^5 has recieved its quarterly update. It now peels POTATOS.  Patch notes: No longer supports carrots. [end]
[start] I don't like it. You have to peel and cut things over and over again and I can't find a script to automate it. Drives me nuts [end]
[start] What I’m getting from this is:  Why do programmers like [anything that doesn’t have to do with programming]? Because it doesn’t work exactly like programming. Because it’s not programming. [end]
[start] Support for carrots is deprecated and will be removed in version 4.4 [end]
[start] I feel like most people who upvote programming humour aren't programmers [end]
[start] Okay, but programmers famously do not like cooking. This is why Soylent exists [end]
[start] Join us in systems programming!  You peel the carrot. You cut the carrot. You put the carrot in the stew. You put the peeler on the counter and it shoots you in the foot. You aren’t sure how it managed to fire a bullet, but you’ve seen stranger things in the systems programming kitchen.  Later that night, you find a bug report for the issue. It was fixed 5 years ago. Your company is currently working on upgrading to the version that came out 7 years ago. Maybe you’ll get it in the dependency upgrade you’ll do ten years from now. [end]
[start] Plus, a recipe is an algorithm that you can tweak [end]
[start] Carrot 1.17 release notes:  New features:  * 22% More beta carotene * Improved colon performance * Half the CRISPR mutations of 1.16  Migration warnings:  * Incompatible with legacy peelers [end]
[start] This is where I am in my life right now. Programming is something I do for money but I’m way past enjoying. Cooking on the other hand owns and I can actually start and finish something that makes people happy within an hour! [end]
[start] /r/suspiciouslyspecific [end]
[start] and dont forget the peeler is made by C lang. [end]
[start] Well coffee makers have DRM know so who knows. [end]
[start] your carrot peeler has thousands of dependency which you'll need to download before you use it. [end]
[start] You put water in a pan and turn the stove on. Sometime later the water is boiling. You don't suddenly come back and realize that a few molecules in the pot had syntax errors and didn't want to boil. [end]
[start] I thought you were going to go with "because it's like following a program" to which I'd reply, "yes, but only for imperative paradigms, declarative would just state the end result and expect you to figure it out."  ETA: Also reminded of the frontispiece to one of the chapters in Brooks' "Mythical Man-Month", which was taken directly from a menu, and pointed out the virtue of patience as it related to good cooking. [end]
[start] Yes, but cooking involves leaving the chair so I can't recommend it. [end]
[start] Deprecated. Please use vegCarrot [end]
[start] I actually *don't* like cooking. And I've been programming for 45 years.  For some reason I can write thousand line programs that work (eventually...)  But I just cannot cook.  One of my problems is premature optimization.  For example, rather than let water boil first then putting the pasta in, I used to "optimise" the process by filling a pot with cold water, dropping the pasta in then putting it on the stove...  Took me 30 years to learn to wait for the water to boil first.... [end]
[start] Not true. You buy the avocado it's rotten inside. You realise you forgot to buy another ingredient from the store. You burn something else. cooking can be as bad as programing and it can't always be fixed. [end]
[start] If I find a big I have to chuck the whole thing out and start again. It's the same as when I'm cooking. [end]
[start] Fuck that noise, I *hate* cooking. It's the most bullshit, weasely thing I've ever encountered.  How much salt is in a "pinch"? What temperature is "medium high"? Was this recipe written assuming cold eggs or room temperature?  I can't cook. I just can't. Even the simplest recipe has so much ambiguous bullshit and it stresses me the fuck out and it never comes out right. [end]
[start] Well at least if I want int64 I get int64.  In cooking same ingredient can be affected by weather (f\*\*king humidity and your pizza taste different!!). Each ingredient is different. So your carrots might be slightly different. Your spice can have different blend if you did not do it yourself. Depending on what you are using, temperature might be different so cooking time is different.  Cooking no mater what require plenty of experience and lot of trials and errors.   Programming require precision.   So if someone is annoyed by things not being precise - he will be annoyed as f\*\*k by cooking. Especially if you manage to make your dish perfect and then you will make it 2 times and it won't be exactly the same. [end]
[start] I'd just send the ball back to my girlfriend, CLEARLY the user requirements weren't well-defined. [end]
[start] Also why I avoid any kind of “smart appliance”   Not everything is made better by an internet connection and I don’t need my washing machine texting me when my clothes are done. [end]
[start] I like to use beta peeler. Sometimes it won't work on heirloom carrots, though. [end]
[start] Really? JavaScript shows errors like this? [end]
[start] But now there's a new package, Peeler\_Buttercup, but it can only work with KitchenOS\_SanJose, but you're using OpenKitchen because you don't want to pay a subscription for ApplianceStove and ApplianceMicrowave. [end]
[start] It's very weird to see someone you know on front page. [end]
[start] Yes, but cooking involves leaving the chair so I can't recommend it. [end]
[start] the older tech actually works better than the new stuff. [end]
[start] Honestly, sounds like the product owner’s concern. [end]
[start] Plus when you compile a carrot you don't have to have all the carrot in the recipe [end]
[start] not following SemVer is probably the most egregious part about this [end]
[start] Yes, but cooking involves leaving the chair so I can't recommend it. [end]
[start] Now you have to chop it before you peel it, or else your kitchen breaks. [end]
[start] Actually, I prefer baking to cooking because it's the more predictable of the two.   If you do `A`, then `B`, then `C`...the result will be `D`. [end]

[start] I am a programmer and I hate cooking. [end]

[start] TIL my oven is a few versions behind (or has some major bugs). The store bought garlic bread told me to put it in the oven for 8-10 minutes at 120. I put it in my oven for 10 minutes at 120. Came out burnt [end]
[start] I like cooking because it mostly works and if it doesn't, I instantly know why. The complete opposite of programming. [end]
[start] Eventually you just say fuck it. I can get this done way faster using the deprecated shit. [end]
[start] You also find out that when you start cooking, there are no compile errors [end]

[TITLE] HeckOverflow [TITLE]
[start] "Why would anybody want to do A?" asks another commenter with clockwork inevitability, without knowing any of your circumstances or constraints and just assuming you are an idiot.  "It's 2018, nobody uses A," answers another commenter smugly, the first year of his CS degree almost over.  When I'm answering question on StackOverflow I often answer like "I would try to avoid doing A, but here's how I would do it if I had no choice"--at least it's constructive. I don't know about any of you but my entire programming career has been 90% making things work under (apparently) bizarre constraints or combinations of technologies that apparently *nobody has ever had to try before*, so I have a lot of time and pity for the poor souls asking these kinds of questions. [end]
[start] > closed as "off-topic" by the 999k rep. guy [end]
[start] My only question on stackoverflow.  Top answer didn't even give me a solution, just straight denied my problem was even possible.  Meanwhile the answer that actually solved it was deleted a few minutes after appearing.  [end]
[start] Then you try B and it doesn't work  So you search stackoverflow again:  "How do I B?"  "You do C"      "But that doesn't do B"      "Yeah nobody uses B" [end]
[start] I remember playing some cookie clicker type of game, and I was looking for an autoclicker (which a lot of these games assume you will use).       First hit I found was on a Linux forum with someone asking for an auto clicker and the response he got was "I can't think of a legitimate use for an auto clicker, so you are probably doing something unethical, so I wont help you. "      It seems to be that case that if you ask a technical question on a linux forum, someone will always tell you why you shouldn't be doing the thing you're doing.  [end]
[start] Sucks cause SO used to actually be a great place to ask questions with very little toxicity. Now I just gawk at the brave souls who dare ask a question [end]

Oh, and (popular library that would take months to get security vetting). Easy peasy.”  A2 (-4): “(the actual answer)” [end]
[start] "You can easily Google the answer to this, so I'm locking it" says the top Google result for that exact question. [end]

Everything about your decisions and thinking process is wrong, let me show you what I so pridefully believe to be correct, but is in fact an utter trash answer and just makes me feel all high and mighty, and serves as a replacement for the love my mother never gave me."

[start] > closed as duplicate of "How do I B?" [end]
[start] Duplicate question [end]
[start] THIS POST HAS BEEN MARKED AS DUPLICATE [end]
[start] I have never made any question in SO. Almost all my questions have already been asked by someone else before, and if I can’t find any, usually I’m pressed for time on the job that I don’t have time to create a question and wait for an answer [end]
[start] "Oh, you asked a simple Linux question that would be answered by a two line command? Let me show you how to write a 15 line script to solve your problem which you will spend 2 hours to understand." [end]

[start] Why is stack overflow filled with a bunch of smug Nazis who think anyone who doesn't walk on a tight rope to ask a question should not be asking anything? [end]
[start] Stackoverflow is full of a bunch of pretentious assholes who think that it’s their way and no other. If you’re new to CS and ask questions they’ll come in like vultures. Used to be a great and inviting community, now it’s just constant down votes.  [end]
[start] "How do I do A"  "Fuck yourself and die. You should learn how to code before trying to learn how to code. Didn't you start CS classes when you were in diapers? if not then you're behind the curve. Also, fuck you and die." - Stack Overflow [end]
[start] This infuriates me to no end about StackOverflow.  I'll ask something like "how do I do X" and each responder asks things like -  - "Why would you want to do that?' - Uh, that's outside the scope of the question. Warn me it's bad practice, sure. But answer the fucking question I asked - "Why don't you do Y" - Because there's context to why I want to do X that I can't explain. Y is a good alternative for sure, but I'm asking about X godammit.  - "What's the context for this question?" - Fair, but I can't explain the situation in my webapp to you and still keep this question general. You shouldn't care about the context, just answer X plzzzzzz   [end]
[start] This really stacked my overflow [end]
[start] This is why I never feel comfortable when I ask a question to a classmate and they say "ask stackoverflow" [end]
[start] Worst possible "answer" : "Nvm, I figured it out". End post. [end]
[start] Reminds me of this:   > ALLEN: Hi, I’m new to driving and I need to move my car back around 5 meters. How can I move the car backwards?  > (2 days later.)  > ALLEN: Hello? This is still a problem. I’m sure someone knows how to do this.  > BOB: I can’t believe you didn’t figure this out yourself. Just take your foot off the gas and let the car roll backwards down the hill. Tap the bake when you get to where you want to be. Boom. Done.  > ALLEN: But I’m not on a hill. I’m in my driveway and it’s completely flat.  > CARL: Dude, I don’t know what you’re trying to accomplish, but you should never be driving backwards. It’s dangerous and will confuse the other drivers. See the big window in FRONT of you? That’s your first clue. Don’t drive backwards.  > ALLEN: I’m not trying to drive backwards. I just need to move back a little bit so I can get out of my driveway and start driving forwards.  > CARL: So just drive in circle until you’re pointed the right way.  > ALLEN: I don’t have enough room to turn around like that. I only need to move back a few meters. I don’t understand why this has to be so hard.  > CARL: Sounds like your “driveway” isn’t compatible with cars. It’s probably made for bikes. Call a contractor and have them convert some of your yard into driveway to be standards-compliant with the turning radius of a car. Either way, you’re doing something wrong.  > DAVE: I see your problem. You can adjust your car to move backwards by using the shifter. It’s a stick located right between the passenger and driver seats. Apply the clutch and move the stick to the “R” position.  > ALLEN: But.. I don’t have a clutch. And there isn’t a stick between the seats.  > CARL: Sounds like you’re trying to drive in Europe or something.  > ALLEN: Ah. Nevermind. I figured it out.  [end]
[start] _thedudehimself_ has the right answer. I don't need to eat or pay rent this month, I'd rather have neato code. Besides, nobody ever inherits awful projects and has to keep them running in production, that's just silly talk! [end]
[start] Question closed as it is too broad [end]
[start] StackOverflow is borderline useless for languages with newer versions. I usually Google my issue, land on SO, find a top voted solution, **try the answer only to find out it's not supported in the newer version**, Google the fuck out of it again, then find another SO thread where the real updated answer is at the bottom of the thread with 2 upvotes. Ridiculous. [end]

[start] Ah, StackOverflow. That place where people answer questions inadequately and then proceed to downvote all other answers while they're at it. [end]
[start] How to build up your reputation on Stack Overflow:  Criticize the question instead of just answering it. Then come up with your own "better" solution. Also, criticize and downvote any attempt to actually answer the original question.  [end]
[start] more like *"Whats the command to print screen?"*  *"I won't know unless you paste your entire script"* [end]
[start] My favorite thing on stackoverflow is when people spend hours berating a person for asking a dumb question instead of spending 30 seconds to answer the dumb question. If you're above answering the dumb question, why is it worth it to berate the person back and forth over hours? [end]
[start] My impression of StackOverflow:  Q: What’s the temperature of the surface of the sun, in K?  Answers:  - (Selected Answer) Centigrade is a much more common scale than Kelvin, I recommend using that instead - You shouldn’t look directly at the sun - temperature is a measurement of average molecular kinetic energy - Can you please post an example?

[start] You forgot the 0 vote answer that the bottom that is very involved and may or may not do A [end]
[start] StackOverflow has saved my ass numerous times. However, upvoting for the lulz. [end]
[start] My biggest pet peeve is when you ask a question and all of the elitist users come rushing like like "jfc didn't you see this post 5 years ago with a slightly related question and a very long and obscure answer that isn't much help in your specific situation?" [end]

[start] My perl code is the bomb, got my technique down and everythin' no tickling or nuthin'. [end]
[start] I'm making a game and I'm in preproduction, so mostly what I'm doing at this stage is setting up a nice and organized code base with all my custom functions and classes to have a squeaky clean and reliable framework so that actual production goes more smoothly, and I worry quite a lot if something feels a little bit messy or inefficient. Memes like this make me feel better. [end]
[start] The only way to deal with that kind of pasta is to bring in something with such high productivity you can replace anything quickly. Shrink the stack, lessen the layers and reduce your long term maintenance. Throw out every piece of garbage software some salesman sold a middle management wieny. Throw out all the self proclaimed genius' code that is really a few simple steps.  Keep your structure in your database not your code and you'll avoid misinterpretations for inevitable interfacing. Never modify if you can competently rewrite. SQL is faster than your code, use it. [end]

[start] People are saying that this can be avoided with version control, but I don't think that's the point of the original gif anyway. Whether you have version control or not is irrelevant, because it doesn't change the fact that your program is still so dependent on this one block of code that you believe to be useless, that this is what happens if you try to remove it. [end]
[start] When your IDE tells you a block of code is not used anywhere but deleting it kills the whole application -.- [end]
[start] this is why I never delete anything, just comment it out! [end]

[start] Dumb question from someone unfamiliar with version control. Do any of these tools allow you to link different files to each other? For example, and HTML file performs a post operation to a PHP file. If the name of the PHP file changes, is there a way to also update the reference to it in the post operation of the HTML file? Or is this type of programming not anything you use version control for? Or do you just manually keep track of all of the dependencies? Or should you not be changing the name of files with new versions? Innocent question please be gentle.  Edit - Typo [end]

[start] Idk if any IDEs have this but I reckon a million dollar idea would be to make classes which you can hide like a photoshop layer and that won’t interact until unhidden. [end]

[start] Pro-tip: while recursive programs are easy to write and read, they almost always end up causing stack overflow issues since each recursive call requires its own space on the memory heap. If you have a recursive program that calls itself hundreds of times, you are bound to run into these issues.  A better approach is to write while loops using stacks and/or queues, where the while loop runs as long as the stack or queue is not empty. You would add and remove items to the stack or queue within the loop.   You can also track various variables and states using the the same stack/queue structure, just make sure you add and remove each of those variables every time you add or remove elements from the key stack/queue. (Edit: or create stack/queues for a class which contains all required variables). [end]

[start] Hm. I once did a machine learning algorithm and I thought it was a good idea to make it recursive so it can select by itself a different choice if the one it chose was bad. Bad idea.

[start] - Fill a change request on the project.   - Have the UI/UX team involved so they can tell you the icon's meaning is not clear enough for a regular user so they'll make you a new one.  - Actually add the new icon (30 seconds).  - Deploy in the dev environment.   - Update the test documentation.  - Have QA test the app.   - Update the app documentation and screenshots.  - Deploy in prod environment.  - Fill your timesheet with the project code. [end]
[start] That's because hackathons don't use jira [end]
[start] Because the whole application is hardcoded in the hackathon. So adding the icon would require rebuilding the entire application [end]
[start] Customer: "I want a button that does X.  It's just 1 button,  why does it take so long?!"  Me: "A button is easy.  X is what's hard."  That's on top of all the process and testing others have mentioned. [end]
[start] I like that allegory. You can perform very effectively for a short timespan because you prepare extensively.  You wouldn't ask a marathon runner to run a marathon every single day, they would probably be completely burnt out after a week, even if they are in top shape. [end]
[start] The devil is in the details. On a hackathon a dev knows exactly where the dark corners of the code is and avoids them. When a design comes down that forces you into those dark corners it shouldn’t be a surprise that it takes longer... [end]
[start] I wonder the amount of coffee consumed during the Hackaton vs a 3 weeks period. [end]
[start] Hackathon: no bs requirements, no meetings with the business, no project management input, minimal testing (does it load?), getting to pick what to work on and who to work with  Regular job: bs requirements that change often, meetings with the business that drain your soul and make one question how humanity still exists with this much dumb, project management that thinks 9 women can deliver a baby in one month, functional testing, load testing, penetration testing, and workmates who make you feel like you are back in that five person group project in college which got you a C because only 70% of the project was done since that is all you had time to solo while the others discussed the Kardashians.  Edit: typos [end]
[start] Of course it takes 3 weeks to add that icon in the application-made-in-3-days. You first got to fix a bunch of rubish until you get to the part you need to be. [end]
[start] It's a load-bearing icon. [end]
[start] Legacy code [end]
[start] That's cause during a hackathon you build the damn thing from the ground up but adding an icon to an existing app means understanding your old code without documentation, figuring out what seemingly useless code holds the world together and sacrificed the unborn calf of a unicorn in order to make sure you didn't delete the entire library while you were at it! [end]
[start] Managers during hackathon: all meetings are cancelled, focus on building something   Managers after hackathon: please clear your afternoon for the mandatory TPS cover sheet sheet meeting followed by an HR seminar on gender tolerance [end]
[start] The difference between building something interesting and building something management asks and make no sense [end]
[start] Hackathon: "Make shit as fast as possible"  Actual job: "Make shit as effectively as possible" [end]
[start] Because bloody marketing kept changing their mind and took 2.9 weeks to decide what colour it should be [end]
[start] That's the difference between a dirty fix and a long term solution. [end]
[start] Coding is *maybe* 25% of my job. Even then, I spend half of *that* on configuration work to get infrastructure to boot up and work together. Infrastructure I don't really choose because it has to be *the most scalable choice*. The other 75%? 25% design. 25% keep the lights on. 25% meetings, sprint planning, helping others.  Now, how I work in a hackathon. I choose everything, including the project. So of course I like to work on shit that's easy for me and that I'm familiar with. Not to mention I don't have to care if anything is misconfigured or doesn't work perfectly. I also get to ignore the other 75% of my job for a day and barely do any configuration work.  Now it's 8× faster! There's also dozens of things I didn't mention, but choke points is the biggest one. Need to fix a bug in deployment in a regular work? 10 minutes per attempt. In a hackathon? I don't even have to care. And now I'm 20× faster. No wonder it looks so amazing! [end]
[start] That’s how long it takes when you try to modify code that was hastily written during a hackathon 😂 [end]
[start] That's because during the hackathon you don't have to spend five days going back and forth with the business analysts moving the alignment of the icon into different positions only to end up back where you put it in the first place. [end]
[start] Sheeeeeeeet!  Almost like being left alone to do your own thing and not being harassed every 20 minutes increases productivity or something. [end]
[start] Motivation vs. no-motivation. [end]
[start] I get the joke but imagine putting that hackathon app directly into production. [end]
[start] "Developers creating a minimum viable product" VS "Developers making changes to a monolithic monstrosity orders of magnitude more complex, insides of bureaucratic and organizational restrictions."  Yes. Totally the same thing. [end]
[start] this guy has never coded in company. :) [end]
[start] Amazing what can be accomplished when you don't use SCRUM [end]
[start] Devops guys [end]
[start] Punchline in the title [end]
[start] Of course the application is full of bugs that no one finds until weeks after the event. [end]
[start] during a hackathon you have a dedicated team of people with no outside communication working on 1 and exactly 1 task.  after the hackaton they turn back on their skype, outlook, and take a peek at their service now queue. thats why it takes 3 weeks. [end]
[start] half the text as a title...🤦‍♂️ [end]
[start] Another post with the punchline from the tweet in the title. [end]
[start]  Hackathons, aka as "make it work and look at least pretty, but please don't make it futureproof" codes that explode if you try to modify anything. [end]
[start] It makes sense actually. Hackathon: people who do work, do work. Work: managers argue about priority, worker tries to work, meetings, help qa, demo, re work, fix bugs, be managed by managers, etc, etc.  You all know what I talking about. [end]
[start] I'm in this post but have to spent an hour long requirements refinement meeting to tell you whether it's in the next sprint for me to like it or dislike it. [end]
[start] Jesus said "I will rebuild this temple in three days." I could make a compiler in 3 days. [end]
[start] More like people arrive prepared to impress since rules are very loosely inforced in most hackathons. [end]
[start] The greatest trick a programmer ever did was combine the concepts of “well, the code compiles” and “hey, it works on my machine” and call it a hackathon. [end]
[start] You’d hope a developer took more care at work than at a hackathon [end]
[start] All of the 80/20 stuff is true, but a working at a hackathon's pace is completely unsustainable for any extended amount of time. You'd have everyone burned out after the first week lol. [end]
[start] The icon takes 3 weeks because I have to first code it, then unit test it, then do a PR. Then it needs to be peer reviewed, and possibly rejected back for fixes. Then it needs to be QA'd. Then we need to get product approval. Then we need to schedule a release, and have it approved through CAB. At any point, if any of the people in this chain go on vacation, get sick, or are otherwise working on other projects, it will delay the entire process.  At a hackathon, we just push it to prod, and if it works, it works. [end]
[start] Relatable [end]
[start] Not to mention, the code needs to go thru *an entire release cycle* to make it in to *production*... considering that Dev, Release Engineering / DevOps, QA, and finally Operations *each* go thru consecutive two week "sprints" to deploy a new release... I'd say three weeks is ***pretty damned good***!!! [end]
[start] And sometimes it makes perfect sense. It would be faster to rebuilt the entire project than to add an simple feature. [end]
[start] It's funny how freedom of beurocratic process unlocks innovation.... and technical debt! [end]
[start] Greenfield versus shitfield [end]
[start] Time it took to build Twitter (I assume): Exactly one smoke-break   Time it took to fund and monetize it to the point where it wasn't just a pointless loss leader: (I have no idea how to make an infinity loop) [end]
[start] and the app they build in a week is built on top of library after library, just stringing together functionality others have taken years to write. [end]
[start] Small vs enterprise software... [end]
[start] It’ll take 3 weeks but we can only do it after the current change freeze and once the latest update goes in Q4 20never [end]
[start] That's one long ass hackathon [end]
[start] Way to put the punchline in the title, my man. [end]
[start] r/PunInTheTitle [end]
[start] Its because of all the meetings that could have been emails. [end]
[start] Yeah that icon that is replacing some :after element, has to load in multiple qualities for "responsiveness", have a tooltip using a custom in house (jquery) library that comes minified because nobody has the original anymore, and scale correctly on iphones and teslas. Yeah, give me the three weeks.  And work on IE6. [end]
[start] The first hackathon I went to was one of those where you sleep at the event. They gave us pool floats. So I stayed up all night linking the back end to our front end. Judging was at 9 the next morning. Great, enough time, that’s like three hours. Next thing I know it’s time to submit and I only have one piece of the functionality done. It still went over well but it’s hard to present an app with one working page. [end]
[start] No deploy process or sdlc at a hackathon [end]
[start] The secret to the hackathon is to hard code everything and if no one can verify the data, just make it up. [end]
[start] That's because you make apps that appears to work in a hackathon, not an app that would work in production [end]
[start] Billable hours .... [end]
[start] Could you imagine a hackathon with change control and hourly CAB meetings? [end]
[start] Goes to show what an absolute ball ache dealing with clients or non-technical people can be if you want to get shit done fast. [end]
[start] Me tryna update my game from the Tech Tests to v0.1.0 [end]
[start] use case vs multiple use cases . But life isn’t so serious so, decent joke. [end]

[start] Hackathons - runs a few times under very limited conditions.  Real world - runs every day with users who will definitely try something out of the ordinary you couldn't possibly predict when there is a "y" in the day [end]
[start] Testing vs not testing. [end]
[start] I mean it's true. I can whip up a proof of concept for a lot of things within a day or two but actually going through, putting in all the documentation, ensuring I'm following the best design practices and standards for the situation, and putting a lot of thought into the code architecture is going to take a lot longer. [end]
[start] I sometimes add points by how boring something is to implement [end]
[start] Ticket : "Please add the following icon to the following page"  Developper : "Done"  Ticket : "No, a little bit more on the right"  Developper : "Done"  Ticket : "Could you darken it when the mouse cursor hovers?"  Developper : "Done"  Ticket : "Also, could you make this animation on blur?"  Developper : "I'm not familiar with animations, please see with @X"  X : "Done"  Ticket : "Nah, revert to the initial implementation, it was better"  Developper : "....done" [end]
[start] Yeah, I hear you.  Everything is fast and easy when you're making all the decisions. It's when decisions become not YOURS that you run into problems. [end]
[start] If a hackathon is 3 days, 2 are for coding 1 should be for documenting and cleanup... that is if you want to do anything with the code other than produce a toy. [end]
[start] I hate Hackathons.    It's supposed to be fun, but it's really just another clever way for companies to get free/cheap labor.  My current employer does two per year...and they make it seem like a big party.  "Great news - free pizza!  Aren't we having fun!!!!"  The truth is...  * It's a dirty way for a company to own your intellectual property.  They give you freedom to work on whatever you want; but they also own it.  At big name companies, they know that 'the next big thing' is likely to already exist in the mind of some employee.  Letting a recent grad explore his or her pet project on company function means they have a legit claim to owning it that they otherwise wouldn't be able to make. * The pizza represents pennies on the dollars for what a fair-market price for your labor would be.  And still, somehow, developers seem grateful. * The emphasis on producing a quality hackathon + the prizes and praise management gives encourages employees to work on their projects long before the official hackathon starts.  People donate their nights and weekends all year, in the name of having a 'good hackathon'.  Our top demos aren't reflective of a week worth of development.  We just pretend it is.  It's nearly as bad as the 'Congrats - you get UNLIMITED VACATION TIME!!!' scam. [end]
[start] Going to need BA, UX, a coupe of iterations, testing, change control, getting backed out of UAT a couple of times for an emergency release, and then being forgotten about. 2 months minimum [end]
[start] "Addding that icon is going to take three weeks"  [https://makesouthparkgreatagain.com/assets/s17e2-4f283ccfcb35eae8681ff4200442fd1fa1d321e5f0c0d045bc12fd79fa7e2c87.jpg](https://makesouthparkgreatagain.com/assets/s17e2-4f283ccfcb35eae8681ff4200442fd1fa1d321e5f0c0d045bc12fd79fa7e2c87.jpg) [end]
[start] A hackathon: the requirements are set by a dev   A project: the requirements are set by sales. [end]
[start] My boss's boss said something like this recently. "three months ago you all built the POC in 5 days, why did it take a week to add this latest feature?"  Welcome to software, dumb-ass. Projects don't get less complicated over time. They get more complicated. [end]
[start] I like how this comment highlights the person‘s inability to understand what he is talking about.  This mentality should make a fine project „manager“.  After all why should one concern themselves with details like technical debt, proper testing, missing automation and documentation. It’s not a necessary feature now and if it ever comes up the effort has risen so much it stays on the unscheduled pile of tasks that will outlive the project. [end]
[start] Takes three weeks because the PMs don't tell you about the change until the final day of the 3 week window because they were on vacation in Cancun, and now they need it done yesterday. Developer needs to add in time for 90% PM fluff and because there will be 90 other requests during that one request on top of already parallel projects that are due. Checkmate. [end]
[start] I've been to a hackathon (as a technical writer). What I saw was seriously underwhelming. What I was able to see was every group doing nothing more than working up a demo or yet another example using some existing web-site or JS library. They would sometimes cobble together a couple of existing sites, feeding the output of one into the input of another with a bit of glue-code. Then they would do a demo presentation and all but hide the fact that most of the work was done by other people who had spent months or years creating that website.  I am now convinced that hackathons are really just practice for quickly coming up with something to show your boss after spending weeks reading Reddit at work. [end]
[start] There is special energy in hackatons. The other fact is that hackatons produce prototypes. [end]
[start] I've never been at a hackaton by I always wondered how it is possible to code working applications in that short amount of time. [end]
[start] I have a hackathon at work coming up in 3 weeks for 3 days. So excited. It's always fun to reset and take a break from enterprise code and documentation and let loose with shitty procedural code full of hacks to present a product that works under one very specific set of conditions. [end]

[start] Lol what? Whatever is new today will be old in a year -- this industry moves fast! 15 years ago, VueJS did not exist. It should be every developer's goal to be continuously learning. You'll get better and better and you'll be able to move to another country, where developers get paid well. There is a very real and noticeable deficit of *good* developers.

Maybe too much emphasis is put on traditional education when a lot of us learn better via alternative education styles. Who cares of you sat in a class and he sat in front of a monitor. [end]
[start] I think these days you can get away with not going to university. A lot of the major companies that set the standard for qualifying have now removed the compulsory need for a BSc for jobs. Microsoft/Google etc   When I was growing up (and I think the culture still exists in Ireland) you had to have some sort of higher level academic qualification. In those times, perhaps it made sense - the internet is not what it is now.  We didn’t have tutorials and such extensively documented APIs. We had books and CDs and floppy disks.  Javascript was used to play MIDIs and rotating skulls gifs were everything.   If I could do it all over again; I would skip university. I learned a lot theory and data structures etc - I never actually used any of it. I’m mostly self taught because they taught us Java in university and while I’d like to think that it laid some sort of foundation for programming; it didn’t - teachers and professors were terrible.   Perhaps now courses are more tailored to what I do. Web, JS etc   (I currently charge £400 a day so the figure in the meme is applicable 🤦🏽‍♂️) [end]

[start] Well, we don't have that problem on Linux [end]
[start] This is going to be a stupid question.  I have used both VSCode and VSStudio. The first for webdev and the 2nd for college work and python.  Why are such (seemingly) similar products so.. preferably different to different people?   I will admit I'm not to deep in my experience but it feels like both of them fit the same role, with perhaps Studio having more tools. While Code is more lightweight from what I can take.  Yet both (seem like they) do just about every programming ability, no? [end]

[TITLE] Optimizing startup times [TITLE]
[start] ...and watch everything break for no apparent reason because the `sleep` function was there to prevent a bug and no one knows why. [end]
[start] I once "optimized" a bit of code that literally just did the same calculation twice in a row because someone had moved it from another file and just pasted it in twice instead of once. Obviously I went to SVN history to find out which idiot did that. I did not like what I found. [end]
[start] I'm used to programming on platforms where the parameter for Sleep is in milliseconds. This confused me a little at first. [end]
[start] This literally happened to me at one of my jobs.  App took a long time to load up through the loading screen, boss told me to try to make loading times shorter.    Turns out that when they were coding the loading animation (a scrolling stock ticker), someone left a 6 second sleep in to simulate a long load time to make sure the animation worked correctly for testing because obviously the loading would happen very quickly when running from debug.  This had been in production for years. [end]
[start] A re-telling of the famous “char insurance” gag. [end]
[start] Actually keeping sleep statements is good practice. Ship the product with it and when customer comes back asking for performance improvement, remove all of them!  [end]
[start] I demo'ed an app that has some sleeps sprinkled around it. The feeling was that "it was too fast, giving the impression nothing is being done".  [end]
[start] Having the native sleep function interpret the given parameter as full seconds  should give you a hint on what kind of people this technology was designed for...  Sloths, vegetables and the elderly  [end]
[start] Man. I'm convinced Windows in certain circumstances has a 'wait for network timeout' kind of deal when logging in. It can take me 2-3 minutes to log in sometimes when not connected to the domain. And nobody seems to care.  I mean, aren't we at a point where if the network takes more than 5 seconds to respond, it's safe to assume it's dead? [end]
[start]     Sleep(30); //30ms [end]
[start] Been there, done that.     One time I had a problem with a recursive function, for debugging purposes I just hard coded it to repeat 100 times... And completely forgot about that... Just found out months later with a big REVERT THIS tag in the comments.  [end]

[start] Had a priority 1 bug that caused an uproar with the support/consultant teams. Multiple clients calling in, all wondering what this "secret message" was that was appearing on their screens.   A UX guy was going through and making accessibility improvements and needed to test some of the styles he wrote for screen readers, and forgot to remove his test data. Best part is that the text was set to not be visible, they just had cached the styles on the page so they didn't get applied until they closed their session. I looked like a hero for addressing this "critical work flow error" in less than 5 minutes, 4:30 of which was spent laughing my ass off.  [end]

[start] This hits close to home for me.. I was making a game where all of the action was programmatically simulated, and early on in the process I had added sleep statements so I could watch things happen to identify bugs... later while trying to balance things I felt pretty dumb when I realized my large scale samples could have been done about 20 times faster....

[start] sooo how many different ways are we gonna repost this joke [end]
[start] In my current job we have a total of five main tables we query all the time.  The previous developers designed the system to get entire data-sets on each call and then used c# linq queries on them to get the filtered data. Lucky there are under 30k records on each table but still damn slow.  `// Get the tables that we need data from`  `// Filter that one row that we need`  `// Return the result to the server`  `// User updates record`  `// Get the tables that we need data from`  `// Filter that one row that we need`  `// Return the result to the server`  `// Current developer has /quit the job` [end]

[start] Not a programmer but I once 'optimized' windows startup time by setting skype not to launch on startup. Shaved a good minute off pressing the button and the computer being usable.  Needless to say the boys and I quickly looked for a better solution for text and voice chat. [end]
[start] what about the 2970 other milliseconds? [end]
[start] That sleep was there to avoid some race condition. [end]
[start] he he [end]
[start] I did this at work because the approach was basically to "wait" until everything was loaded, but I switched it over to an observer/observable approach so I knew exactly when everything was loaded.  Blew people's minds except one guy who insisted we still have a small wait time in there.  That was back as a jr dev and I think it irritated him I found a solution. [end]
[start] Alternatively you can add a sleep(-30) call on startup. Code refactored [end]

[start] // TODO: Remove the sleep time added below. [end]

You are good. Here is a B because one image loaded from a different domain. We don't know why we don't like that, but we don't like that" [end]

[start] This makes me feel better about this beast of a CSS file I’m working on. I thought I’d be fancy and split the SCSS files into a bunch of super specific types and areas to be organized, but instead ive just accidentally re-wrote too much styling to count and now it’s all compiled together in a much bigger than needed CSS file. If i has just done it my usual way my file size would be like 75% smaller.     Too late now, fuck it. here ya go backend devs.  [end]
[start] Why did you add it in the first place? [end]

Someone else, by some miracle of chance, just so happened to have a full CSV export of the table that they made the previous day. Restored it within 5 minutes, with no reported issues.  [end]
[start] I do not know the first thing about programming. Couldn’t you just control+z and boom. Fixed? [end]
[start] We all have our stories where we learned to wrap every statement in begin and end tran.  Yes indeed. [end]
[start] Funny story, when I first started my internship one of the things we had to do was update user information for production. A lot of the times we would do a transaction query but I got lazy and went ahead and updated the statusID for a single "site" but forgot to add the "where" clause so I updated the statusID for the entire prod protocol. [end]
[start] Or you can always wipe a production server completely. [end]
[start] Accidentally ran a automated test on production once.  Went and deleted our newest client's project.  Had to get the previous day's backup and then had to perform all the updates that were made that day manually.  Never been so scared in my life. [end]
[start] I once did a "delete logs", which contained some 100 million records and did a transaction lock on the database for a couple of hours and shut down our production line for the day while it rolled back.  Yeah, that woke me up... [end]

[start] 10 days in to my first web dev job, I lost all 10 days of my work when I fucked up and overwrote my file folder ... while trying to put them in a github... so theyd be safe.   I lost everything. All of it.   Thankfully (lol) the head developer that same day made some sort of fuckup and trashed the production db. We had a backup from 24 hours previous, but our client lost about $5,000 worth of work they had done in that database. Hundreds of users had their daily work product erased entirely.   So I got off pretty light on it.   [end]
[start] Now thats some wonky nerd humor, dude. [end]

[start] Waking up is not equal to a deadly heart attack [end]
[start] At a previous job, my ex-manager truncated our principle SQL server and our backups, because our dashboard which showed real-time behavior was acting "slow". He was already supposed to have lost IT privileges at this point.  Unfortunately, the database  not only tracked data, but also contained all the startup procedures for an experimental power grid, which included a couple tons of LiPo batteries - which had been set to charge the Friday before.  We eventually got everything under control, but all the engineers vowed to leave at that point. [end]
[start] This one morning, I got a call that the name of every user in one of our systems had been changed to "John Travolta" in the middle of the night.   It ended up being one of our guys trying to build a new UI for adding/updating users and he was testing with that name. He forgot a little piece of criteria in his upsert. Ahh, testing in prod. What a great idea. . . [end]
[start] Deleting a table is fine: You can roll back unless you've enabled per-statement transactions.  _Dropping_ a table, on the other hand... [end]
[start] If it's early in the morning you can just pull from a backup. You do it later in the day it becomes a shitstorm. [end]
[start] All of these stories end with "thankfully, we had backups."  I want to hear stories without happy endings. [end]
[start] DBA here. I can restore in my sleep...unless you've deleted my backups then I'm wide awake. [end]
[start] I essentially did this once. I was correcting a users' points value and left off the WHERE statement. Basically reset every single user's points. Heart started going a mile a minute, began sweating, and all I could think was "oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck".   Luckily there is another table that kept track of every transaction having to do with a users points. So after I calmed down after 30 seconds but what felt like multiple minutes, I went about fixing the problem. Wrote a python script quick to total up and set each users' points record. Script took 15 minutes to write and an hour or so to fix each persons points record. Sat down with my co-founders in the morning, "So I fucked up last night... But I fixed it"  The lesson here: When fucking with production **always make changes as a transaction**. That way you can rollback instead of having a mini heart attack. Another option, write an internal api and/or cli for making regular changes to production. [end]
[start] It will wake up the whole team [end]
[start] Yesterday, I woke up because in my dream I tried to import 144 bisquits into a database.   The other day I dreamt that my cat is working on a PHP script, using my pillow as a keyboard.  I think I need a break....  [end]
[start] Or running a query that deletes every row in a table or updates a column in every row to the same value because you were missing a where clause. May have done that a couple of times. [end]
[start] Being new at my job, the thought of doing this accidentally makes me shiver [end]

[start] With all the key referencing in our production database I don't have proper backups/permissions. [end]
[start] "Delete" a table? Do you mean delete rows in a table or DROP a table?  NOOB ! [end]
[start] rollback; [end]
[start] I've done this.  Turned out ok. [end]
[start] I incorrectly updated like 5 million rows once. But, that’s what happens when you let a junior developer update the production database without doing a code review. [end]
[start] Undo drop is a thing you know. [end]
[start] To this day I will never forget the day I had not slept for several days - and while the media was visiting the studio I accidentally did a "Drop All" on the live DB for a very popular video game.  Thank God for forward thinking network ops guys. [end]

[start] More relationships have been lost that way.   [end]
[start] The trick is to set it to delete automatically every morning if you don't manually stop it. You won't hit snooze if your database self destructs in 10 minutes. [end]
[start] youre giving me anxiety, stop.  [end]
[start] And if that doesn't work - deconfigure storage arrays, reimage server cluster nodes and demagnetize the backup. Also draw dickbutt on your boss' door. [end]

[start] Story time.  So I was in the process of moving servers from one DC to another.  We were setting up new hardware at the new DC and migrating the data over to decommission the outdated hardware at the old DC.    The way the previous CTO had it setup was there was a single jump server used to access all this old hardware.  Perfectly normal, however this server also housed internal monitoring programs and tools.  And, to top it off, the way to do the jump was you had to be logged in as root...  So I'm chugging along, running shred on a large group of servers, when suddenly our monitor and tools start going offline.  Shit, I realize I didn't jump to the old server, and started to run shred on the jump box.    We at least had good backups at the time so we were able to easily restore everything, but man did I have to listen to jokes about shredding for weeks. [end]
[start] Mmmm the purge. [end]
[start] Nothing worse than hitting execute on a command and watching it spin.   This shouldn't take this long..... oh nooooo [end]
[start] Man, I still get flashbacks from that time I overwrote an entire database the night before we were supposed to present it in class. It may not have had the same stakes as it would've in the real world, but it certainly wasn't a good time.  [end]

[start] I was working in a government institution in Australia that shall go unnamed a few years back. I was a contractor so I was working off the network on my own laptop. Pretty soon I start hearing “hey is email working” from several people and just starts spreading everywhere. Turns out the admin had accidentally deleted the active directory and when they went to restore from backup - it didn’t work. They had to get people out from Microsoft to fix the problem. Not sure if that guy lost his job or not. [end]
[start] Developers, product managers, project managers, front end support and other clowns with no dba admin expierence SHOULD NOT have access to production dbs. This reason among many others is what replicated dbs and reporting/qa dbs are for. The only fool here is the management that thought allowing devs rw access to prod was a great idea... your db cia (confidentiality, integrity, and availability)model deserves to diaf if management pulls this bullshit.  If you want to reduce capex by pulling this garbage business strategy, you deserve prod data loss. [end]

[start] I once asked a dev to modify one row in a table for testing purposes (on prod) but he forgot to execute the update with the where clause... updated all 400K+ customer records.  Thankfully there was a batch process that could re-build this value across the table after a few hours.. but he did go a bit white for a while there.. you know.. that sinking feeling when you see more than just a "1 row affected".. [end]
[start] On the first day as an intern at a new company that I like very much, I thought that I deleted a very important table, since I was not familiar with the UI and I accidentaly clicked the wrong button. I had the biggest meltdown, turns out I did nothing wrong tho [end]
[start] Been there, done that. Luckily for me the data I had deleted was more or less logging information and was never selected from, only inserted into. [end]
[start] Or narrowly avoiding a car crash on the way to work.  [end]

[start] I️ love going through this subreddit, because I️ have no idea what anything means lol  [end]
[start] At one job, we specifically ran a 24hr lagged slave because a certain developer would decide tables were no longer needed and drop them. About half the time we'd discover that they were actually needed.  Rebuilding from a lagged slave is a lot quicker than backup restoration (or rather, it *was* with the available technology at the time).   Used to drive us crazy. [end]

[start] As a Canadian, I hate it [end]
[start] Canadian here; it's when the back-end uses colour and the front end uses color that I wince a bit. [end]
[start] It is...bothersome. [end]
[start] Don't forget the other non-native (non-)English speakers writing things in, say, python -- which reads pretty close to actual English in my book. Also, "grey" is a css color; not all is lost. [end]
[start] I'm British, yes. Same with center. [end]
[start] Yes it does.. and PHP we write <?=£myBritishVariable ?> [end]
[start] Isn't this template just another way of sharing a shower thought? [end]
[start] Some of the popular R packages (dplyr, ggplot2) have both spellings available. So there will be a set_color function and an identical set_colour function at the same time... [end]

[start] Not as irked as whenever I have to do anything with the Referer HTTP header. [end]
[start] I  absolutely hate every time I have to type in 'color'. [end]
[start] I once worked in an application in New Zealand where the API (from a US company) called the resource something ending with -ize and the application had it with the British spelling, ending in -ise. Really confusing to debug [end]
[start] I think it's nice, leaves 'colour' free for me to use as a variable name. [end]
[start] I always program in "American". Just avoids conflicts. [end]
[start] Web development is why I learned to accept "American English". I'm so committed, sometimes I'll call a group of people "y'all". [end]
[start] Learnt British English in school. Yes, it really bothers me. [end]
[start] Technology being based on America generally bothers me. Why are display sizes given in inches, standard paper size in LaTeX is "Letter", resolution is given in dpi and the date format often is given in mm/dd/yy? Are you serious 'murica? With your technology you gonna force your backwards units and measures upon the rest of the world? [end]
[start] Not anymore, I tend to use American spelling of \`colour\`.  But I do internally pronounce it like \`collor\` [end]
[start] Wow never thought about it. I learnt British English and it never came to my mind that 'color' is not how we spell 'colour'. [end]
[start] As an English human it disgusts me [end]
[start] tbh I always feel bad for people that are used to writing in non-roman characters. I mean imagine if it was reversed -  could you get by trying to write code with Kanji or Cyrillic or w/e? [end]
[start] Oh my god it used to piss me off so bad, I'm so used to it sometimes I almost spell it like that when I'm actually writing. [end]
[start] Yes. Yes we are. [end]
[start] I set a snippet up so I can write colour and it gets changed. [end]
[start] Not our fault they want to keep being French with all their unnecessary u’s. Hon hon hon. [end]
[start] When I was new to coding and was making a plot I was absolutely furious to realise this was the bug ........ [end]
[start] Yes we are. And with everything on this humoUrous sub. [end]
[start] In one of my software jobs the boss insisted on using British English in the codebase despite the platform being written in American English. Ended up with duplicate values like lightGrey vs lightGray etc as well as numerous cases of not being able to debug an issue correctly as most people would search for the American spelling, not the British one.   What a mess 😅 [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] But, it's efficient, one less letter and one less byte to transmit each time. [end]
[start] Canadian here. We also spell it `colour` and yes, it does bother us. [end]
[start] `const labelColour = colors.primary;`  Haters gonna hate.  # 🇬🇧 [end]
[start] As a Brit, it didn't matter to me, I just moved to using American English entirely with some exceptions like the "word" aluminum as opposed to aluminium. [end]
[start] New Babel plug-in idea [end]
[start] I'm Canadian but at this point I just adopted American English so people stop questioning the way I say 'Z', the way I spell 'color' etc. :P [end]
[start] Not British, but yes, it annoys the shit out of me. [end]
[start] Nah, I’ve just adopted color everywhere else instead...  I feel sorry for all the non-english programmers. [end]
[start] Gray  Vs.   Grey [end]
[start] I still use "referer" in my variable names whenever I'm capturing/storing/evaluating/retrieving the HTTP referer header field.  &#x200B;  somethingSomethingReferer  &#x200B;  So I'm sure the Brits are fine. [end]
[start] I'm Canadian. When I am writing English prose I spell colour correctly and when I am programming I write it american. Centre has the same treatment.   Documentation, now that is a can of worms. [end]
[start] I’m Canadian, due to programming, I spell some words the American way and some the British way. I also have a British dad and American mom so some of my pronunciations are mixed between the two. Overall, talking to me for the first time will make you very confused of where I am from. [end]
[start] Australian here, can confirm, gets me every time. [end]
[start] Aussie here. I learnt HTML before I learnt that Americans spell some words differently. I’m sure you can imagine how long I spent bashing my head against the keyboard when my <centre> tags weren’t working. [end]
[start] As a german I'm in a weird in-between state. I intuitively write 'colour' in texts but also write 'color' in CSS intuitively. [end]
[start] As an Australian, can confirm this happens way too often. In fact, I propose an Australian-British CSS standard [end]
[start] Funny, I did exact thing last week.  "Why isn't the text colour changing on that span?"  **20 seconds later**  "Ah! Yeah, that's why" [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Yes [end]
[start] Happens to Canadians to, we use the British spelling for a lot of words too. [end]
[start] as a Canadian I am irked by this bullshit [end]
[start] I can imagine they are.  I had to use an API (Ogre?) that was written by a Brit and it had ALL sorts of things spelled wrong :D [end]
[start] Massively actually. It's like an autocorrect that has learned a wrong word by accident and now always changes your input to dumb gibberish. [end]
[start] I’m irked anytime I have to write anything in CSS [end]
[start] very [end]
[start] Canadian here. It's an annoyance. [end]
[start] We are. [end]
[start] years and years ago i remember doing a pull and seeing a new file "colour.h" committed by a South African guy. and the dude next to me said "great, now we have to localize that too" [end]
[start] I'm experiencing that shit ! [end]
[start] Let's also not forget about Center and Centre.  The Colour one never really bothered me, but the Center/Centre really does. [end]
[start] I have an extention that changes it for me, yes I hate it. [end]
[start] As a Canadian, yes it’s kind of annoying. [end]
[start] Yes. [end]
[start] Yes. Yes we are.  My team lead won't let me #define colour either :( [end]
[start] Not just the British, as a kid learning HTML for the first time in an Indian school I absolutely hated it to my core. Though you get used to it over time, it's like when I'm typing in an IDE I'll write "color" but over a text message I write "colour" without even thinking. But it still irks me ever so slightly though. **The Commonwealth will remember.** [end]
[start] Holy fuck I always write grey instead of gray and different tools always give errors [end]
[start] We are. [end]
[start] Yes. We are. [end]
[start] Yes [end]
[start] Yes [end]
[start] The only possible way to write CSS is:      background-color/*[sic]*/: gray/*[sic]*/; [end]
[start] I was on a Russian website yesterday and checked the HTML and I was thinking about this. Do developers in other countries learn English before they learn to develop or do they just memorize the English words in tags without knowing what the words actually mean? [end]
[start] I've often thought "how do people program in another language, is everything english and they have to adapt or do they have their own version of languages. [end]
[start] I feel this deeply. I'm from India and we mostly follow the British form. [end]
[start] It doesn't just bother Brits it bothers everyone that is not American. [end]
[start] Its the same in networking.  Having to use “neighbor” instead of neighbour in Cisco operating systems! Fml [end]
[start] ....And center [end]
[start] Nah it's just annoying when you type colour and each backspace feels like a betrayal to your country [end]
[start] I make a point of calling functions "initialise", etc. [end]
[start] As a brit - "color" hurts me. [end]
[start] Im sure there is a preprocessor out there for it.  At least its not the CSS grays. [end]
[start] In Unity it's the other way around. The main class you derive from is "MonoBehaviour".  Though come to think of it, the color class is called "Color". Weird mishmash. [end]
[start] Yes, and center [end]
[start] At first it irked me, now after many thousands of uses I'm numb to it 😅 [end]
[start] I mean, they can spell it right way or the wrong way. The only way code runs tho, is when it's spelled the right way. [end]
[start] It does irk them.  source: am british [end]
[start] You mean "develoupers? [end]
[start] Thank goodness most languages were created by Americans. I'd lose my mind seeing and spelling things wrong all the time. [end]
[start] I'll rag on american differences all the time, but I much prefer 'color' and I use them interchangeably outside of css without caring. Couldn't imagine being annoyed by it. [end]
[start] I just spell colour as color and grey as gray. Makes life easier. [end]
[start] They say British as if a lot of other English speakers don't spell it that way :( [end]
[start] I almost prefer it now tbh [end]
[start] It pisses me off every time...  Half the time I forget and wonder why shit isn't working. [end]
[start] Yes we do [end]
[start] I accidentally spelt it like that in my essay lol [end]
[start] As a person who just had to make a colour related webcomponent, YES [end]
[start] Yes, we really are irked by it. It's COLOUR you yankee bastards! [end]
[start] I'm on a team building a program for an intranet localized to the US, and one of our devs is a British expat. He submitted a PR recently which defined a config variable containing the word "colour".  I didn't have the heart to reject it. [end]
[start] I have done things like `Color colour;`. No regrets. [end]

[start] this could not have been more accurate lol [end]
[start] Other solutions:    1. A bigger lock, one that can span both handles, but the customer will not buy a lock when they already have a lock  2.  Relocate the handles closer.  This is hacky and the architect won't approve it.  3. Reengineer the cabinet into an enterprise solution with a hot new secure buzzword lock 2.0 with cloud integration features.  Customer is wowed and buys it.   The developer forget to install the C clip that holds the lock in place so it falls out first use and no one can figure out how to open the cabinet.  Millions are being lost by the second.  Panic ensues.   4.  The system administrators finds an open source lock, some spare parts, and fashion what we see in OP pic.  Normal users don't understand how it works and this is no documentation on how to use.  Only a skilled handful are allowed to touch it.    5. CEO orders locks removed because what so important that were locking up a cabinet made of particle board?  Every looks around and realize no one thought why only the how. [end]

[start] I’ve found that do-while loops are only good for user inputing. I could be wrong but that’s only what I’ve ever used it for :| [end]
[start] This only works if they weren't already running, right?  It's not like do...while does an extra iteration at the end, it just guarantees the code in the loop will run once regardless of the condition.  [end]
[start]     LOOP:     MOV DOWN ACC     JEZ END     MOV 1 LEFT     JMP LOOP     END:  vs      LOOP:     MOV 1 LEFT     MOV DOWN ACC     JNZ LOOP [end]

[start] for(;;){ } Change my mind  [end]
[start] I have literally never used a do-while. I've never found a use. [end]
[start] This is not correct, do while affects the beginning behavior not the end behavior. The Coyote is safe unless they started already at the edge with this code.  I wrote this out to prove it http://ideone.com/ErFYr4 [end]
[start] Meh. Both end at the same time. The later gives you a guaranteed iteration at the start. [end]
[start] This bothers me a little. Won't both codes produce the same result as long as they don't start right on the edge?   The coyote one: >run  >not on edge  >run  >not on edge  >run  >on edge -> stop   ??? [end]
[start] I've literally just sat here for 10 mins thinking about this.  Theses two are equivalent unless they both start running whilst standing on the edge, right? [end]
[start] Is this humor or just educational 🤔 [end]
[start] This post and its comments show how many people misundertands the do->while loop.  I think a more accurate version would be   - *while(distance_to_edge > 0)*   - *while(distance_to_edge >= 0)*   assuming that *distance_to_edge* becomes negative beyond the edge  [end]
[start] While: (E.){ Coyote(); } [end]
[start] Given the smoke behind them I assume they didn't start at the edge, so the do while would have ended at the same time. Sorry this is shit. [end]
[start] This is... wrong? Why did this get upvoted? Either method would result in you running off the edge, unless the “edge” is classified as a specific area still on the land portion of the cliff, in which case neither one would result in running off the edge... very bad analogy [end]
[start] I don't understand how you guys find this shit entertaining. I feel like a lot of people here just like that they understand the reference. [end]
[start] I've never liked do/while syntax. It's one of the only instances where a code block's signature/parameters/conditions are written AFTER the block of code. It feels weird and inconsistent.  [end]
[start] There are two difficult things in programming, cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.  [end]

[start] 2nd one is bad if you start at the edge  [end]
[start] Quality Humour! [end]
[start] You better have a good reason to use do while or else [end]
[start] Or a case of off by one error. [end]

[start] Clever  [end]
[start] While(y) [end]
[start] I’ve never used a do-while loop.  It may occur to me at some time to use it, but in 10 years or so, it hasn’t. [end]
[start] Just finished my CS final and I actually had to use a do while loop. We manged to learn about it then never use it ONCE practically.  [end]
[start] I did some Java for a bit and I get this completely [end]
[start] I think I understand programming now :O [end]
[start] There's a hidden joke in here at Microsoft's expense. [end]
[start] Does function run() work without any parameters? No location, no? [end]
[start] This is the wrong interpretation, though.  He would still have stopped at the edge in your code when coming from the cliff, unless you continuously call this loop. [end]
[start] I literally have not used a while loop in over a year, and I feel healthier and better than ever.   My relationships are better because if it too. [end]
[start] "Do loop" is like saying you can sky dive without parachute but only once. [end]
[start] Looks like a nasty race condition [end]
[start] If someone sends me code with a do-while loop I think less of them as a person [end]
[start] I've been a hobbyist programmer for four years and I don't think I've ever used a do... while... Loop [end]
[start] That can only happen, if both of them already stand at the edge at the beginning of the iteration, which is not a very realistic scenario. Otherwise both of them stop before falling.   But however, it‘s a funny picture. :) [end]
[start] Great way to remember entry controlled and exit controlled loops [end]
[start] This code irks me. The run function could still send you off the cliff regardless of the while check. How far forward will run() make me run? Am I guranteed to end up directly on the edge before falling off?   [end]
[start] This cartoon is incorrect and is going to make new devs that see it get the wrong idea about the do loop.  That's the end of their race the do loop would only iterate on the first iteration and then stop. A better example would be if they were at the start line and the coyote ran before the start gun went off and got disqualified. [end]
[start] I wanted to upvote, but... that indentation ruined it!  [end]
[start] Saving this image to refer to when debugging [end]
[start] Anyone that uses the do syntax is a sociopath [end]
[start] It’s used correctly but it’s a do while loop instead of a while loop. The do while is check after, where as a while loop is checked before [end]
[start] Ohhhhhh... So that's why my touchscreen code didn't work... [end]
[start] \+1 for clarity [end]
[start] I can count on one hand the number of times I've used `do...while` where it made more sense than `while`.  And of those times, maybe half turned into something better after the first time I iterated over it. [end]
[start] Ouch, that really hurt! Who uses a do while loop, honestly? [end]
[start] Do{}while false; [end]
[start] "Do While E. Coyote" [end]
[start] Edge the browser? [end]
[start] This makes some odd (and, in basically every case, incorrect) assumptions about `run[]`.    Why was the bool in the roadrunner's case evaulated when the roadrunner arrived at the edge?  Wasn't the roadrunner running prior to what we see here?  The curmudgeon in me refuses to laugh.  And actually frowns nextra! [end]
[start] But one wouldn't use do unless they know how to correctly use a while loop, as it's both more advanced and takes longer to type. [end]
[start] am i the only one who has no idea what this is?  [end]
[start] This would have been nice to see my first semester of programming. I was obsessed with do while loops :( [end]
[start] Aaaah, you forgot import physics.gravity; [end]
[start] This is great, I think I learned something.  Beep beep. [end]
[start] Why doesn't python  have a do-while?  Or a switch-case for that matter?  I don't care if some people think it's unnecessary, you tell me a nicer looking way to code nextToken loops. [end]
[start] For loops are the superior loops fight me [end]
[start] This is now a permanent member of my desktop background rotation. [end]
[start] This is a great way to illustrate things like this  [end]
[start] See roadrunner is so fast he has to use the do while in order to avoid the first check and get enough of a headstart. [end]
[start] I took a quarter of java. I get this joke. I is fellow programm humor.  [end]
[start] While:      do_something_at_least_once();      while (not need_to_stop) {         do_something_at_least_once();     }  Do-while:      do {        do_something_at_least_once();     } while (not need_to_stop);  What now? [end]
[start] This only works if you start on the edge though, right? [end]
[start] So your saying that roadrunner was just programmed better? Just to applications running around.  [end]
[start] Hey, I don’t know how to program at all, but my dad is and I’m finally considering getting into it. However, this made a lot of sense to me, which is really cool because I struggle with programming logic. Maybe I just need a cartoon picture book full of programming lessons!      ....Am I disabled? [end]
[start] Damn, now I feel weird. I use do while loops all the time for my programming assignments. [end]
[start] In R any loop you write is ‘wrong(tm)’ and you instead should twist your brain around using an apply function. Loops are notoriously slow in R.  [end]
[start] Hahahaah, great job  [end]
[start] I’m not sure what language this is, as all I know is a semesters worth of Java, but I get this and I’m happy  [end]
[start] Took a course on lynda.com last week for programming and this is the first joke here I've gotten. Feelsgood.js [end]
[start] “People who use do whiles are losers”  -me with only ap compsci has background, and never really understood how to use a do while [end]
[start] Another fine piece of evidence that do while loops are trash [end]
[start] Hah, I feel smart for understanding this. [end]
[start] This is amazing [end]
[start] Not a programmer here.  Is this so the verb is prefaced with the situation as opposed to verb termination conditions?  [end]
[start] This doesn’t make sense and only misrepresents do-while loops. [end]
[start] The only time you need a do/while is when you have a priming read on a file..  [end]
[start] Yeah, but this example is only valid if they start running from the edge of the cliff; otherwise the logic is exactly the same. [end]
[start] Methinks that most don't know what edging actually is.    But there is actual logic for it.   Coding challenge: create a graph, using open source apps only, a png generator for displaying the results of actual edging in a multidimensional array.   Goal: Produce a mean algorithm for fails and succeeds.    Collection Methodology: Use a an open network (website, phone app, etc.) to collect data   Restrictions: In the sample use anonymous but confirmed health-care workers. [end]
[start] you could need the second one in some scenarios. you want to stop after some condition that the running function created. [end]
[start] This is just misleading [end]
[start] Gotta try it at least once to see if I like it. [end]
[start] I never use do loops. [end]
[start] I have never, *ever*, written a do-while when I meant to write a while.  Always the other way around. [end]
[start] I've never found a good use case for do..while [end]
[start] As barbaric as it gets       If notEdge():          Do:              Run()          While notEdge(): [end]
[start] I understand this!!  [end]
[start] I've still never found a good situation for a do-while. While loop always makes more sense [end]
[start] What about for? [end]
[start] I don't know anyone ever who has covered this topic better than this. [end]
[start] Q: This would only happen if they were already at the edge right ? [end]
[start] ELI5 please? [end]
[start] I disagree... after the first iteration of the do while they become the same thing.  The only difference between them is that the do while will run at least once where as the while could not run at all.  Suppose it does depend how long run() is but basically unless the loops start right at the end of the edge (or within range of the ran()) Coyote would be fine [end]
[start] Notice the coyote is looking away from his direction of travel. He runs, but checks for the edge after he crosses it. I.e. he Does, but the test for the edge is aWhile later.   Consider that Run() takes time to start and stop. If the logic asks for Run() and then aWhile later checks for danger, you are asking for trouble.  [end]
[start]     while (true) {         if (edge){ break; }     } [end]
[start] I have never once in my professional career used do while [end]
[start] I find myself using very few while loops in Java [end]
[start] Or y'know while and until too [end]
[start] But you only need one of these... [end]
[start] This is a fantastic and memorable illustration! [end]
[start] Just explain that do while will always run once.. this is complicating it [end]
[start] Technically this is wrong. Do while loop starts with the execution and then checks the condition. Once the condition checking starts, it will not execute when the condition doesn't hold. In this case the coyote runs on a solid platform and ends up being out of the edge. i.e. it first runs the solid platform which is equivalent to the condition returning true. So no way the loop would run when edge is true. [end]
[start] I don’t know why but I am so proud to know what this means. [end]

[start] Im a bit worried that no one brought up security yet. Do you really want to publicly expose your database? Also any connection credentials that are stored in your frontend are basically public too. [end]
[start] To be fair, I worked at a company that did exactly that. All the logic was inside the database.   Suffice to say: It was a nightmare getting all that shit out of there [end]
[start] > only forward the request to the DBMS  Firebase goes up and beyond to make everything look transparent, but there’s still a bunch happening there. That’s partly why you pay that much for Firebase. [end]

[start] If I remember correctly, super meat boy was having the game push high score directly to an open MySQL server, with the username and password hardcoded in the game. They probably patched it after the global high score reached MAX_INT or something due to all those score "hacking" lol.  Speaking about no backend, CouchDB is exactly what they want, allowiing you to connect the client directly to the database, and can host your entire static assets as well so you don't need a web server (the db *IS* the web server). [end]
[start] I'm making an account just to reply to this. Front-end developer with 12 years experience here. Creating a serverless based app is a completely acceptable paradigm and solution as long as it's for the right use case.   I have an app for climbers in the iOS and android app stores that syncs thousands of location data from a database with a recursive GET and uses IndexDb (database in the browser) to store locally. (this happens once for first time users and is about a 5mb download) Why do I do this?     1. Because the data is available offline (climbers can access without an internet connection outside) 2. Because the data can be queried, users can search without having to make an API with, for example elastic search.  3. Because it's cheap for me, i'm the sole developer and I don't need to hire backend people. It's a local database with an javascript based api.. 4. It's freaking fast... lightning infact 5. Security, you can encrypt, but I don't need to do it in my case  Again, perfectly fine to connect directly to a database if you need to, in my case this is exactly what I am doing.   You NEED a backend most of the time though, for example with user credentials. I'm just stating, there doesn't need to be a blanket reason not to do this. [end]
[start] fuck it, direct queries and writes to the database [end]
[start] Did he just invented server-less apps? [end]
[start] Pro tip - don't even bother going to the database, just keep all data client sided. [end]
[start] Why can't people ask legitimate questions like that without some snarky douchebag chiming in? [end]
[start] Why not just give the database to the customer directly? That would be the easiest thing. [end]
[start] The appropriate solution to a problem depends on the nature of the problem. There will be occasions where it's entirely reasonable to build an application consisting of nothing more than a front end and a database.  A lot of the answers here seem to presume a hell of a lot about the environments and business problems which could possibly exist. Half of them seem to assume that every application in the world *must* be made of microservices and restful endpoints presented via a web application.   Nothing could be further from the truth.  For example: "I work in the finance department of a small company with 30 employees, and 50 products in inventory. We use windows. We've been keeping track of stock by looking in the back room whenever someone places an order. We'd prefer to have a program we can use to allocate stock so we can see how much of each product we have without having to go to the back room and count it". Cool, that can probably be whipped up in a couple of hours with a winforms application and a SQL express backend.   Similarly, the idea that "logic should never exist in the database" seems to be received wisdom, not anything supportable with a sound argument. It's trivial to show why this is a terrible idea if it is treated as universal. Suppose I have a problem statement like this: I have tens of thousands of customer accounts in my system, and millions of orders. Each account is associated with a number of users. Each user can place multiple orders. Each order can have multiple invoices, and a single invoice could also span multiple orders. I would like to know the most recently placed order for each account, but only if the order has been invoiced, and the invoice was paid by someone other than the user who placed the order.   With SQL, answering this can be done with a query that is not at all complex to write if you have any competence in SQL at all. I would suggest creating a stored procedure to encapsulate that logic, and expose it. If you try to answer this with pure application logic your performance will be absolutely horrific. If you try to use an ORM or some kind of application code which can be translated to SQL, like LINQ, your performance will be absolutely horrific.  The specific "place" where your business logic lives makes no difference to the question of whether you *have* a business logic layer. It doesn't matter whether it's in a stored procedure or not, any more than it matters whether it's in a dll or not, or what the name of the file is, or what the file system hosting your application code is. The concept of a business logic "tier" is a *logical* concern, not a physical one.  The idea that logic shouldn't exist in a database seems to have come from books like Evans' DDD, which treat the database as nothing other than "a persistence layer". No, hard drives and SSDs are a persistence layer. Tables don't store data. Disks store data. Tables expose that data in some logical structure. Stored procedures can provide a public interface on top of the "private" data in the tables. You can enforce this with object level permissions in the database.   If someone wants to tell me that a database is "merely persistence", then I'd like them to also explain what "DURABILITY = SCHEMA_ONLY" does for a SQL Server in-memory table. [end]
[start] The guy asking the question obviously never heard about Microsoft Access and how a weapon of mass destruction it is. [end]
[start] Because “to database” is the backend.  This is a question only a boot camp, or self taught front end web developer would ever ask. [end]
[start] That was a snide reply to a valid question, and the reply is not even accurate.  Here is the ultimate reason that frontends cannot perform database operations:  If the frontend performed database operations, then the frontend would require database credentials. But the frontend is, by definition, downloaded to users' machines. So your database credentials would be public knowledge, and any user could edit your database. [end]
[start] Why do we even need a frontend? Just give the user access to the database! [end]
[start] I mean if you have access control on the database it is a completely viable design pattern. [end]
[start] We have frontends that go straight to the DB and it's called SQL Injection. [end]
[start] Stuff can get processed on front end. That answer would be correct few years ago, but not today. Ever heard of Hasura or Prisma2? [end]
[start] It can make sense in certain applications. Not the usual CRUD work, of course.  We're using mqtt.js to directly control a swarm of IoT devices - the browser runs a static page that listens for messages, displays values, and can send cryprographically signed commands. All without any backend involvement. [end]
[start] Actually you can if there is no security required. [end]

[start] I have personally encountered three ERP applications that work this way. A Windows binary that directly connects to a database. JTL-Wawi is widely popular in Germany. You can Google it. The company behind it is even offering "cloud" MSSQL server, IIRC. Which is just MSSQL server over the internet.   The other two are not known very well. One is a Windows cost controlling software for government agencies, which is also a Windows application connecting to Oracle over network and the other is a DOS app, loaded into Windows over a network share and connecting to a "local" db on the same share. People would use that simultaneously, as long as no to people would change data in the same table.  Other than that I only know the big ERP suites like Lexware, SAP and Sage. IOW, while I know about and have read about correct client server programming on the internet (Dolibarr, Tryton, Kivitendo, etc), the majority of the stuff I encounter just plugs the client directly into the database. [end]
[start] Have you heard of r/Firebase? They have a really compelling reason for connecting to the DB directly from the front-end.  They address security and all of your other usual concerns. [end]

[start] Last year my company got a contract which involved refactor, it was a angular app that would literally send sql queries via http request to a php backend which would just execute the exact query passed from the frontend. Authentication and sessions was also stored on the frontend. The project was eventually canned. [end]
[start] Client can do processing and connect to a database just fine. You just don't want it to. [end]

[start] I had a customer back in the 90s, who sold skin care and shampoo and such. He saw the potential of internet sales early on, but our application was only for sales support, warehouse and finance. He wanted to give customers direct access to his database to place their orders, unfiltered. It took some time to talk that out of his head. [end]
[start] 😂😂😂😂😂😂💨 [end]
[start] In web-systems and publicly exposed frontend it makes sense to have front/backend.  For business applications (restricted usage, not as many concurrent users) there's client-server architecture where clients connect directly to the database. In the cases the processing is in client application or some time embedded with the database (procedures, various embedded extensions).  While answer is funny, there is a point to the question: that kind of architecture is not obsolete but mostly in offices and such where client-application can be controlled, not for general public. [end]
[start] > stuff needs to get processed  That's really not the main reason. You could 'easily' process everyhing in front end but you would probably go insane after 1+ year of maintaining it. Not to mention security. [end]
[start] Bobby'; Drop table.. -- done [end]
[start] This made me realize that there really isn’t a front end in the first place, or the front end emerges like a shadow from the shape of your back end. Basically you don’t have a mouth hole without first growing some guts. [end]
[start] JavaScript master racers are getting louder, I see. [end]
[start] Front end is just a textbox with "enter SQL command here:" 🤦‍♂️ [end]
[start] One could say there is such a thing and it is called firebase [end]
[start] Granted this is probably more targeted towards SQL databases specifically, but there are many databases that expose http APIs and are intended to be interacted with directly from the client (such as elasticsearch, couchdb, and lots of serverless databases like firestore and dynamo), they implement their security layer and can handle ACLs to control data access. For simple apps it can be perfectly adequate and enable fast (and secure) rapid prototyping without over-engineering a solution.  The point that the person here is making is perfectly valid, if it is a simple CRUD app with simple ACLs and some form of managed auth (i.e. OAuth/OpenID/AWS credentials), simple database storage solutions over http are a solved problem and can enable a developer to simplify their stack greatly. Just because an architecture sounds unconventional doesn't mean it should be shunned or ignored if it can otherwise enable developers in a secure, scalable way. If you get the chance to truly experiment with building a serverless app (and I don't mean by abstracting dynamo behind lambda), I urge you to give it a go. [end]
[start] Firebase would like a word with you. [end]
[start] No joke, I worked at the same company with a guy, C,  who was contracted to the same client I was, but a different group. I felt so bad for his point of contact. C was so hard to work with. He had no concept of UI or UX. He built an application that only ran in IE6 (in 2012), and basically it was a long vertical scrolling page with a list of tables. Each table was a mirror of a database table, even including the probability key column. The client had to manually enter their relational data in database tables, essentially. There was no validation that FK references worked or anything.  Somehow he didn't get fired or reassigned despite the high levels of frustration from his point of contact and constant complaining to our company. [end]
[start] Like if frontend could not process things? No that's just a matter of authority [end]
[start] This analogy seems to imply that we also get things out of the toilet... [end]
[start] Well, guess I have more to learn. Here I was thinking the database WAS the backend lol [end]
[start] Yeah let's just put our database credentials in the front end code that GETS. DOWNLOADED. TO. EVERYONE'S. MACHINE. Not to mention you would just giving away your "secret sauce" because they would have all of your business logic, algorithms, etc. [end]
[start] Im sure SQL exists for no reason. [end]
[start] Just send the whole database with passwords in plaintext and let the client-side software deal with it. [end]
[start] The system at my girlfriend's job (she's a kind of secretary at the municipal courthouse) does that. The client connects directly to the database, with a master password, and does everything client side. Each user has a password and different permissions, the client uses the master password to go into the users table and check the password that the user provided, and decide if they have permission to do whatever they're trying to do. Everything is there, including the budget, payroll, the files for all the cases (they handle mostly traffic violations and local business/building inspection and permit cases). Obviously my girlfriend took the password out of the client and runs everting with a bunch of scripts, bypassing their "security" system [end]
[start] Database == toilet, accurate comparison [end]

[start] Where do Hot Pockets fit into this analogy....? [end]
[start] It is actually quite frequently done - with varying levels of WTF-ness:  I’ve seen quite some sites where somebody who really shouldn’t be called a “developer” just inlined SQL commands into the front-end PHP code. Usually that’s the point where I’d say that won’t touch this code if I can’t first refactor it...  More commonly though I’ve seen sites where the entire front-end/back-end/DB Code is rolled into one messy big ball of mud, without any discernible layers and structure. Heck, there are even popular frameworks out there that stipulate this approach...  That means there are actually professional developers out there who create systems that are nearly impossible to account for change before they are even rolled out, just for the sake of adding another “hype” framework to their CVs.  Sorry, got to rant a bit. Neighbours kept me awake all night. :-/ [end]

[start] Do you even firebase bro? [end]
[start] Michigan is my favorite character [end]
[start] Why even have a front-end? Just publish the database credentials and make things easier for everyone. I mean, having just a front-end is essentially doing that, but who has time to look at the compiled JS in Sources? [end]
[start] Yeah, client apps are lazy, they can store the credentials to connect database. So much time wasted on rest apis [end]
[start] Also,end user would find a way to f it up. This is a fact. [end]
[start] Too dump to be a real question [end]
[start] All you MFers acting like IndexedDB isn't a thing.  Plenty of frontend apps directly access a database, it's just that the database is entirely local to the browser.  Also Microsoft Access is just a frontend to a personal database. In fact you're building the frontend inside the database. [end]
[start] English is not my sadness to feel. [end]

[start] But that's just the idea of GraphQL, isn't it?  The processing can be done in the frontend, and the security is a microservice. [end]
[start] I know of enterprise applications that do this and its awful. [end]

[start] Phpmyadmin did it before it was cool [end]
[start] The answer is a perfect analogy of the shit that is my code [end]
[start] Yo, anyone remember PHP? That shit was wild. [end]
[start] The answer in the image is actually completely wrong. It has nothing to do with the need for the data to be processed - your front end could just do the processing if that was the case.  The problem is that if the front end talked directly to the database then a rogue user could manipulate the data in a way that made it all meaningless, read everyone else's data, etc. [end]
[start] What if your backend IS the frontend.... *Blazorgang* [end]
[start] I'm sure somebody else had probably did this in the past but this could be a cool experiment. Like give a front end to users that can do whatever they want with the database and let's just see what happens. LMAO [end]

[start] Actually thats not true, based on the model you create and if you were using binary classification then your AI would be taught that jumping off a cliff is bad and therefore it wouldnt do it.  Lol at the downvotes because most people in this sub are wannabe software developers who use it to feel like theyre actually somehow closer to the industry by being here [end]

[TITLE] Back in my day, you had to roll the volume up yourself. [TITLE]
[start] The worst part is that it takes a full revolution to change the volume 1% [end]
[start] I just want to say that I'm not a subscriber here, nor do I understand much of anything about the mechanics of creating software, but I am just in love with this little contest you guys have going.  That is all. [end]
[start] Ok, this one is my favorite.  [end]
[start] I'm having Myst flashbacks. [end]
[start] I was expecting the volume to gradually go back down after he stopped turning; this is too convenient. [end]
[start] Every day we stray further from god [end]
[start] I havent seen a volume control based on the outside temperature. [end]
[start] Power volume control was a game changer in the industry [end]
[start] Can anyone explain the reason behind volume slider gifs poping up now and then. What am I missing?  [end]
[start] Brings a new meaning to "Crank that shit up" [end]

[start] Read that in Soldier: 76s Voice [end]
[start] I don't think you understand this challenge, you have to make a shitty volume slider, not the best one ever! [end]
[start] Let's go home, ladies and gentlemen... Let's go home!  It's over.  \volumecontrols [end]
[start] I honestly wouldn't mind seeing this fad go on forever, could we make a subreddit for these? [end]
[start] Today was an absolutely awful day for me as I've been pretty distraught for most of it. I saw this post just now and it made me hysterically laugh out loud. Thank you so much OP :) [end]
[start] Next year on House Hunters:  "Well my wife is a conceptualizer and I make digital volume control interfaces. Our budget is 9 million." [end]
[start] now that's what I call cranking the volume up [end]
[start] Guys we should make a GitHub page with all of these controls. [end]
[start] [my idea!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6evbfd/who_can_make_the_best_volume_slider/didw9rv) one of you guys actually made it!! i'm so happy! this was the best thing to stumble across on r/all [end]
[start] I kinda miss cars with these... [end]
[start] This is how using the pads of the steam controller for mouse scrolling works. [end]
[start] I swear to god you guys are trying to give me an ulcer. I've been avoiding programmerhumor because you guys keep pushing me over the edge.  [end]
[start] What kind of gui are you guys using to make these?  [end]
[start] COuld you make one with gears? You know, for efficiency! [end]
[start] Crank it up!! [end]
[start] I want to see this with a real crank hooked up to an arduino  [end]
[start] This is amazing! I thought it was going to be like 5 revolutions though, lol! :P [end]
[start] I prefer to pump up the volume [end]
[start] Back in my day, we'd have this payload delivered by now.  [end]
[start] Back in my day you had to burn a game to a cd-r just so your broke ass cd-rom drive could read it [end]
[start] I always prefered the QWOP style control for hands rather thanusing the mouse directly [end]
[start] I am not even patient enough to watch this whole gif ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ [end]
[start] As requested the [fiddle is here](https://jsfiddle.net/dhpxt1q3/). Please be gentle. I would never do anything this hacky irl. I used the [jquery-ui-rotatable](https://github.com/godswearhats/jquery-ui-rotatable) library for the heavy lifting. [end]
[start] I'm not a programmer and I don't understand what you guys do but please don't put any of these volume controls on my computer.  [end]
[start] So many peope have no idea what this is referencing. [end]
[start] Best one yet [end]
[start] a whole new way to crank up the volume [end]
[start] It would be better if it only moved while the cursor was on the "handle".  [end]
[start] back in the day, when I was young I'm not a kid anymore, but sometimes.., [end]
[start] I'm subbed to this subreddit and I had no clue the volume slider thing started here! I saw a megapost of these on imgur and you guys are so creative! This is definitely one of my favorites. [end]
[start]  You forgot to make it so that you must keep the mouse over the graphic in order to turn it. [end]
[start] That reminds me of the really old phones where you had to induce the ringing signal by cranking a handcrank.  EDIT: turns out this is called a [magneto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_magneto) [end]
[start] use a knob [end]
[start] my favorite part is that it's turning the wrong way [end]
[start] Crank the volume! [end]
[start] This made me think why we don't have car windows that roll up and down instantly. Just imagine all the decapitations.. Also left handed stores would become a much bigger thing. [end]

[start]  Hey /u/MrTarantula,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts. [end]
[start] Subscribing to this subreddit was the best decision ever [end]
[start] Should make it even better by having it turn up 1% per revolution like it is now and down like 50% per revolution. [end]
[start] Is that a Windows 10 cursor? [end]
[start] so who's gonna post the jsfiddle?? [end]
[start] Technically, isn't this exactly what we are doing when we use our scroll wheel to adjust the volume? [end]
[start] Hacker news tipped me off to the volume shenanigans going on here. This is wonderful! [end]
[start] I remember this. It was so annoying when pinion worn out. [end]
[start] What if it was each tenth of a revolution? [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] You have installed it backwards! You're rolling it down! [end]
[start] Someone please skin this to look like windows 95 [end]
[start] You need to add a condition that breaks the handle and whose probability is correlated to total spins [end]
[start] Is this for real? [end]
[start] Imagine being a programmer and changing it to 5 revolutions to change the volume by 1% [end]
[start] Cmon, a wind-up volume would've been better. You'd have to keep cranking to keep the volume stable. [end]
[start] I need this in ProTools  [end]
[start] A friend of mine gave me a lift home in his car once, and I was caught of guard by the lack of the window button at my door. Then my eyes gazed upon this lever, and a tsunami of nostalgia just drowned me in that moment. All those years as a child struggling to raise the window. It actually had me speechless for a bit. His car wasn't old at that time, just the lowest variant of the model. I realize that cars were still sold with lever windows but I hadn't been in one for more than a decade at that point. I exclaimed "Dude, it's one of those lever windows!". He seemed to have been getting slack from others for it and just said that I can drive the car instead if I didn't want to bother with the lever window as only the driver side had auto windows. It didn't bother me but I drove the car anyways. [end]
[start] Why when I saw this the first thing I thought was fidget spinners? THEY HAVE INFECTED MY MIND! [end]
[start] so this is an ipod classic? [end]
[start] https://youtu.be/F0GmyE68kME [end]
[start] The funny part is that the volume knob on old TVs was a potentiometer and you actually had to twist it to adjust the volume level. (I think it was a full twist to go from 0% to 100% if I remember correctly) [end]
[start] Fidget spinners have taken over humans to create spinning apps :P [end]
[start] Imagine having this when you're parents are about to walk in on you watching porn... [end]
[start] Isn't this UI design horror? I mean it's not badly coded, nor hard to code, and a programmer wouldn't have come up with it in the field. Has this sub lost its direction in the persuit of lols? [end]
[start] So funny [end]
[start] i dont get this meme about volume, can someone explain??? [end]
[start] Back in my days @ University we had no iMac, Computers and iPhones. [end]
[start] Osu! Players will love this [end]
[start] So if you got to mute, you have to roll REALLY fast? [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] You are so oldschool you were breakdancing with Ludwig van B. [end]
[start] Make a well pump volume control and the volume % display can be a bucket [end]
[start] I'm not complaining, as I've enjoyed several of the volume sliders, but how did this meme get started?  [end]
[start] I hate how hard I laughed at this.  [end]
[start] /r/volumecontrolmemes [end]
[start] Darn this ! Darn this to heck!! [end]
[start] Alright, this, but you wind it up and then it ticks back down. [end]
[start] Not evil enough.  The volume should increase AS you crank so you have to find that perfect spot. Also it should scale like an old radio knob so that if you turn it really fast it only changes by a few numbers but if you turn it slow it changes fast.  [end]
[start] Well, I can’t complain since this **is** Windows after all... [end]
[start] Imagine trying to turn down porn when someone walks into your room in this... [end]

[start] Real men read the source code as documentation. [end]
[start] I am fully aware of the benefits of README files. That said I don’t think I’ll ever open one until I’ve exhausted every other option [end]
[start] No shit I've been stuck on a Python error for 2 weeks and the README to Python 3.7.0 explained the error and provided a command to fix it. [end]
[start] You can hire me now, when it's new and fresh in your mind. Or you can hire me later, when your customers are complaining and support costs are outrageous. Either way, if you want people to actually use your shitty software there had better be some docs to support it.  Sincerely,  Your friendly neighborhood tech writer [end]
[start] 1. goes to stackoverflow and searches gets the README after a downvote 2. goes to google, searches forums and 1 wild dude full of abuses points to the README 3. goes to gitter chat spams the library dev team and gets the README before getting blocked 4. goes to telegram , writes README README README 1000s of times before some random dude points to the README 5. goes to youtube and searches for the README [end]
[start] Kind of like rules for pirates [end]
[start] I often put useful explanations or notes in comments in my code, and then months later completely ignore the comments while I spend an hour figuring something out that would have taken minutes had I read the comments. [end]
[start] README? Don't tell me what to do!  [end]
[start] Useful documentation is so rare. [end]

[start] “A week in the lab can save you an hour in the library” [end]
[start] RTFM (is that old school now?) [end]
[start] I like reading READMEs, my issue is the current trend in a lot of popular github repos that explain what the repo is but doesn't explain how to use it, or it only shows an example for one use case (no documentation/wiki either). [end]
[start] Sometimes the README results in even more confusion and wastes several hours. 90% of my job sucks because of shitty documentation.  [end]
[start] Alternatively a few minutes on r/learnpython can save you SECONDS on testing.  “Is -1 the last or second last index of a list?” [end]
[start] Many years ago I used this line in a job interview for a freelancing analyst/developer.  They didn't get it.  I got the job.  I had no fucking clue what I was doing.

[start] Reading isn't fun. I'd rather bang my head against the wall out of frustration as I can't get something to work. [end]
[start] I never realized how many people don't read the docs or even the Readme's.  Been watching programmers on Twitch for a while and 80% of the time when a viewer suggests a new package/tool, the programmers just ignores all documentation and go ham at it. Nothing works or something works but in an unexpected way.  A lot of times I just spam in the chat "Please just read the Readme from top to bottom. It's all there", but nope... Better waste an hour or more trying first 🤔🤣 [end]
[start] only if it says READMEFIRST!!!IMPORTANT coz i dont wanna brick my computer [end]
[start] Or you make error first then read readme. [end]
[start] On the flip side, trusting an out of date README can also waste hours of work [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked  [end]
[start] Replace the readme with lecture note, tutorial and final exam question . [end]
[start] failure is how I learn [end]
[start] You see, this is how you learn that developers are not very good with people. If you wanted your customers to actually read what you want them to read, put that stuff in a text file named DO NOT READ THIS.txt instead of a boring README.txt. I assure you that everyone will open it at least once to peek at what it says rather than straight up ignoring it. [end]
[start] All I know is the readmes for themes off theme forest don't give any direction. [end]
[start] 😇😇 [end]
[start] It’s more of a... Guidline... [end]
[start] Why read it, if it's abandoned anyway?   *cries in python* [end]
[start] There’s no fun on Readmes :) [end]
[start] Stack overflow [end]
[start] If only the README could grab your attention like maybe make it capital letters or something  [end]
[start] You say that, but the good stuff is always behind on documentation. [end]

[start] Hah, next you probably want me reading ikea manuals too! [end]
[start] nonsense, just ask your question(s) in usenet peeps! [end]

[start] What is this README.txt file? Could never find the full form of README. Msybe its a virus file. I should delete it. [end]

[start] Tell me about it.   I'm a creature of habit and slightly stubborn.    [end]
[start] so trueee.  &#x200B; [end]
[start] Everytime I see a README file, I feel a surge of rebellion like “Dont tell me what to do”. Maybe if instead of README, the filename was USEFULTIMESAVER... [end]
[start] Sometimes I open READMEs just for fun. Never found anything helpfull in them :/ [end]
[start] Well said. [end]
[start] i highly recommend finding an over eager, preferably on prescribed Adderall, youth and have them figure it out quickly and then explain in to you in enough detail that you're both able to equally communicate together, trust me, that's the answer, coming from a man-child with Mommy and Daddy issues, ha ha ha...

[start] Lol, what a crock o shit.. the readme only ever gives me 10% of what I need to know. [end]
[start] I liked that comment when I saw it on HN the other day too. [end]
[start] In English please  [end]
[start] i thought this was programmer humor but looking at the comments i'm starting to think I'm the only one not retarded. and i'm clinically retarded AND drunk [end]
[start] tfw someone stores the build scripts in src/gui/linux/qt/build and doesn't fucking document this in the readme [end]
[start] Readmes are for end users not developers. [end]
[start] I see a readme and my first thought is “don’t tell me what to fuckin do.” [end]
[start] "Months of coding can save you literally hours of R&D" [end]
[start] I feel like the only person here that actually goes through the readme [end]
[start] Okay, joke, sure, but really though, the number of times outdated readmes have made understanding harder completely destroys my faith in them. [end]
[start] also remember: looking at the README for minutes doesn't necessarily make you have no trial and error [end]
[start] Yeah, IF YOUR A FUCKING COWARD. [end]
[start] What's next, you're going to ask me to read the IKEA instructions for the new media center I bought? HA! [end]
[start] So i'm not a programmer by any stretch of the imagination, but I'll be 35 next week and decided to give it a shot.  Yesterday I spent 3 hours in app inventor doing the same thing a zillion times until I finally realized my simple error.  The feeling after figuring it out wasn't triumph or relief, but disgust.  You guys are the real MVP's.   [end]
[start] You should always read the REAMDE.... [end]
[start] Make sure the README is in all-caps to grab peoples attention. [end]
[start] One of my project README had only project name. That's it! [end]
[start] The one README file that got read was back in the Mid/late 80's. Harvard Graphics had a release where they decided to use the 8.3 file name as HGREAD.ME  This was fine for the main product, but they also had a free additional program in the package called Show Partner. I know a lot of people who opened up SPREAD.ME and were disappointed. [end]
[start] Gold  [end]
[start] Or I could spend hours attempting to decipher a cryptic README. They're not all good. [end]
[start] Jake Jake Jake Jake [end]
[start] Dev loper? [end]
[start] You learn more through the struggle [end]
[start] In all my years of development I have never seen a helpfull readme.   [end]
[start] And reading a README that turns out to be out of date and incorrect can waste you days. [end]
[start] Reading is boring, I wanna press buttons. [end]
[start] Many have been the occasion of the reverse being just as true. [end]
[start] This feels like a personal attack [end]
[start] We should rename all the READMEs as LOOKMEs... So now problem solved! You already looked at them with `ls` [end]
[start] Hahah [end]
[start] How can hours save you minutes?  Your logic is illogical.  [end]
[TITLE] Job offer written by HR [TITLE]
[start] They want the guy who spent 5 years developing Swift [end]
[start] [removed] [end]
[start] On the other hand, a few weeks ago I was scanning resumes for an Android developer. Someone said he had over 10 years experience in Kotlin and had deployed a Firebase+Android project in 2009, which I found fascinating. [end]
[start] I saw an ad the other day that included...  "Experience with Sequal Databases" [end]
[start] The amount of times I get a recruiter in my LinkedIn mailbox saying "I see you're a Javascript developer. I have this cool Java project. When can we talk?"... Reminds me of this. HR and a lot of recruiters pay zero attention. [end]
[start] I interviewed somehow once whose CV said he was an expert in Microsoft SQL Server 2007, assuming it was a typo.  During the interview I asked him about it and he went on and on about this version, including features not even in SQL Server at the time, I've no idea what he was taking about but I just don't get why someone would lay on the BS so thickly.   [end]
[start] Good old HR.  Keeping people who need jobs from work, and employers from filling slots with good people... And eventually hiring some fuck tard who has no business in the shop and being paid for their "service"  [end]
[start] If I teach my dog how to code he can achieve that in little more than a year! [end]
[start] They mean Taylor Swift [end]
[start] These types of job offers are usually written when they already want to hire a specific person, but company policy says that they need put out an ad before hiring someone. [end]
[start] I got a message from a recruiter last year about a job for someone with experience in "java(script)"... [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] You have to do time travel so that you can have 8 yr experience [end]
[start] Looks like Becky in HR lied when she put “attention to detail” on her resume. [end]
[start] Thats because they cant outsource the job to India till they "try" to fill the position locally.  They dont want to give you the job, they just want you to apply so they can claim they had applicants who applied for the position, but they were unable to find a qualified candidate.  They do the same thing with wages...  position averages $50 an hour they'll list at $15 and then claim they couldn't find anyone so they can outsource the job to India for $8 an hour. [end]
[start] Once I found a job offer for an experienced Angular 2 developer. Angular 2 was in beta around that time [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Yes but they do this intentionally. If a company wants to hire an international worker they need to show that no-one was able to fit the requirements set, so often they set an impossible bar that no-one local can fill so they can hire their international worker on a visa. [end]
[start] I mean, I can see a HR person doing that. If they had no knowledge, they'd see a lot of companies looking for people with 1-2 years of Swift experience, and decide that since nobody here knows anything about Swift, they'd just put 8+ years to find experts. Any basic research would bother HR too much. [end]
[start] I actually have 8 years experience with this language and have booked a time machine to come back to apply this job. [end]
[start] a job I recently applied for was stoked I was young and fluent at Python, then was turned down due to lack of experience  [end]
[start] If you were a 10x developer, you could get your 8 years experience in less than 10 months. [end]
[start] I remember seeing a listing asking for an assistant manager with 3 years manegerial experience. Like, wtf? You become A.M to help the current manager and learn how to be one. How are you gonna just come up with X amount of years experience? I may as well open up a lemonade stand and hire someone with 10+ retail and customer service as well as a sales executive thats 25-35 with 20+ corporate experience! [end]
[start] I see this shit all the time with Angular. “8-10 years of experience with Angular 4/5”  [end]
[start] That can’t be true, but I read it on the Internet, so I’m doubting myself. [end]
[start] the ol' Kobayashi Maru  [end]
[start] It’s nice that idiot companies identify themselves. [end]
[start] Fucking relevant: http://imgur.com/IY4qfb0 [end]
[start] I have a couple of programmer positions avalaible where I work. When I write the job description, I leave the tech part blank and give it to the IT director to fill it up. You should see me during the interview, when he and the candidate begin talking about the more specific langage knowledge, I feel like I’m not even speaking the same langage....and I studied a few years in programming in college... just to show how there’s so much and it changes a lot over the years... [end]
[start] I think they want the combined experience of 3.333 programmers stacked into one lab coat  [end]
[start] Perhaps they were looking for someone with 8+ years of Taylor Swift experience [end]
[start] That's because the people who make the posts have no fucking idea what the job is [end]
[start] unfortunately, just about every job is like that nowadays. the other day i saw a job ad for a facilities assistant and they listed how a college grad was preferred. that made me laugh, a facilities assistant can get by without a hs degree.  [end]
[start] Honestly what do you do in this situation? Do you lie so your application makes it through their bullshit applicant sorting software? Do you just say "multiple years experience with swift" and risk hearing nothing back? Or do you call them out on it in the cover letter and risk looking like an arsehole? [end]
[start] Isn’t this how the PM/Management teams write it so “hey look we can’t find anyone (because form based resumes like taleo ) so instead of using an employee off operating budgets let’s use a contracting firm off capital expense budgets.”  Or maybe that’s just what a prior boss did.   [end]
[start] In Germany it's now possible to grow weed for medical purpose, but you need 3 years of experience in (legal) growing to grow legally. So there is nearly nobody in Germany who can do this. [end]
[start] Another one I see is:  >Experience with Javascript Frameworks like Angular, Bootstrap, Ember, Vue, Foundation, and React  Motherfucker - those things are not the same! [end]
[start] It's man years! [end]
[start] My favorite is "we found an exciting opportunity for you in Omaha Nebraska as a VB developer" ...deespite the fact my profile specifically details what I want to do and where [end]
[start] H1-b Fraud. [end]
[start] half of the test is figuring out that the test is wrong  [end]
[start] As my last job taught me, a lack of competence among your hiring staff can substantially undermine what you're going to be doing there. This extends beyond HR. [end]
[start] https://thedailywtf.com/articles/5_years_C-pound_experience [end]
[start] And yet, I'm sure they have an H1B all lined up with exactly that much experience... sigh... [end]
[start] They’re all like this.  You need 5 years in React, 4 with Angular, 8 years in Java, and 5 years with Laravel.  Plus you need to be an expert in Ruby and SharePoint.     Motherfucker - what tech stack do you think I’m using? [end]
[start] had a question like this thought it was a test. how many years of experience do you have using windows 7. been IT since DOS 6.2 . had to look up when 7 was released before i answered LOL [end]
[start] HR, Fucking up companies since forever.  [end]
[start] That's the problem with people that can barely operate outlook.  These people determine requirements for IS or IT roles.   [end]
[start] Oh my god I see this all the time in my city! I live here in San Antonio, Texas and this is basically any job posting involving Swift.  [end]
[start] HR being incompetent should not surprise anyone. I think by now it's a requirement to get hired in HR. [end]
[start] When you are required to have job openings but you have no jobs to give.  [end]
[start] FYI: more often than not “X years of experience required” is just a tactic to stop unqualified people from applying for the position. If you know your shit and can do the job, ignore it and apply! [end]
[start] "We'd love to hire fellow Americans, but we can't find qualified workers!" [end]
[start] So I'm actually active in the job hunt, and have found an absolute truck load of jobs that want, "5+ years of React Native"...so I guess that's open to literally the people who made it [end]
[start] Once you are in, all you do is.the basic stuff.  [end]
[start] Reminds me of when I was told they wanted someone with a longer period of Node.js experience. I was working with and giving talks on Node.js within a few months of it dropping. I was like "Oh, well, you should give Ryan Dahl a call." They literally asked if I wanted to refer him. I laughed out loud. [end]
[start] Nice [end]
[start] The real skill wanted here is time travel. [end]
[start] A clue that they may be planning on working you about 110 hours a week. [end]
[start] I saw a job opening for a "Java full stack developer", yea you can't write Java frontend lol. [end]
[start] You have to've got 8 years experience in those three years bro [end]
[start] It's a mind game to weed people out.  Most job ads are. [end]
[start] Quite a good way of weeding out people who either don’t know much about Swift or are complete BSers. [end]
[start] Either that, or they're looking for someone with 8+ years of experience in implementing SWIFT connectivity (financial messaging)... [end]
[start] That seems to be pretty common. Back in the early 2000's I saw a lot of requirements for 5+ years experience with c#. [end]
[start] How do you know they aren't referring to Swift object storage? https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift [end]
[start] That's the trick. They want you to tell them that.  [end]
[start] I had an attempted scammer that wanted me to email my drivers license to a CTO for a 'CSS3 and HTML5' position with 'top devs'. It is like they dont even try [end]
[start] He’s talking 8 years Taylor Swift fandom experience  [end]
[start] You could gain 8+ years worth of experience in 3 years if you're swift enough.  [end]
[start] After I left my last job they posted a listing looking for someone with 6 or so years of experience with an internal program I'd written less than 6 months ago. [end]
[start] You made my ICT Husband laugh [end]
[start] For a while, FedEx airline had space shuttle experience as a minimum hiring qualification. That's right, you had to be a fucking astronaut to qualify to fly cargo around in the middle of the night in a dirty old jet.  [end]
[start] They want that h1b [end]
[start] Maybe they meant Taylor Swift, it’s important for the office dynamic. [end]
[start] Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. [end]
[start] I saw the same but for React [end]
[start] Ask if they'll split the difference and settle for 5 years of experience. [end]
[start] I once had an HR lady start talking to me about ventriloquism and puppeteering because I had Puppet on my resume.  [end]
[start] Swift is also a global payments service. If the job was in financial services then it is more than likely that it’s the far more we’ll known swift payments that they need experience in. [end]
[start] Time passes much slower when developing swift--  believe me. I've spent a few days with it and I feel very qualified  [end]
[start] It’s probably on there to weed out people who just put all the job’s requirements on their resume, wether they actually meet them or not. They wouldn’t want to hire someone who doesn’t know Swift is only three years old. [end]
[start] I remember seeing ads like that about C++, back when it was new. [end]
[start] I present to you corporate america laziness at its finest. Corporate HR ALWAYS takes the laziest approach when hiring and is ALWAYS trying to social engineer people. Fuck corporate america. They are literally killing america. [end]
[start] No you didn't  [end]
[start] Brand new tweet, old joke [end]
[start] Maybe they’re looking for one of those mythical 2.67x rockstar developers. [end]
[start] I wanna be optimistic and assume openstack, but I know better :-( [end]
[start] I’ve got Taylor Swift experience.  [end]
[start] Eee fresh joke [end]
[start] it's simple. they want a time traveler  [end]
[start] 8+ years of C++11 [end]
[start] Easy: Time travel. You got this. [end]
[start] gross [end]
[start] >Not programming in a hyoerbolic time chamber [end]
[start] Requires 5 years of experience in time travel  [end]
[start] *Image Transcription: Twitter Post*  ---  **iDK @ SCR Saga**, @kevinkaywho  Found a job opening that requires 8+ years of Swift experience.

[start] Oregon go fuck youself. [end]
[start] They will still get applications for people who have that experience apparently.  [end]
[start] The first person to mention on the sbmission form for the resume calling this out should be the one automatically granted the job. [end]

[start] Lol I hope OP includes that fact in his cover letter in the event the HR bimbo is the one vetting the candidates.  [end]
[start] The bar is high. [end]
[start] Why don't they link to the job listing? ?   (Because it doesn't exist)  [end]
[start] just apply and correct them during the interview. nothing to lose. [end]
[start] HR is always so out of touch in this industry. It's hilarious and cringe.  [end]
[start] I've seen people asking for 8 years HTML5 experience.   [end]
[start] 🤔🙄🤣 [end]
[start] Go for it. They’ll think you’re a genius.  [end]
[start] They want Steve to climb out of his grave and run the company. [end]
[start] Maybe they the Capitalization was a typo. [end]
[start] HR can fuck off  [end]
[start] i have 38 years of Java experience. [end]
[start] They want people who are in the know about this [end]
[start] I had one asking 7 years of Vue.js.... [end]
[start] Memes and jokes aside, are people that much of an idiot? [end]
[TITLE] Just do your thing already [TITLE]
[start] Maybe it's just me but example code is always much more helpful than documentation when first learning a library. [end]
[start] Oh Louie. That requires so much god damn strength and he's tall too.  EDIT : Not tall actually. I swear I saw him tower over people in videos. The mind, ey? [end]
[start] That's beta breaking if I've ever seen it. [end]
[start] It's crazy how many people here know who this is. I've never seen him in my life but have seen Atleast 5 comments about him. [end]
[start] If it works, it's not wrong. [end]
[start] I love the combination of coding and bouldering. Thank you! Great content! [end]
[start] 5 minute? No problem.   „oh and we don‘t really have a good documentation, so please also consider reading this stackoverflow post and this blog (not created by us) and this subreddit (the memes will guide you best and will explain all the bugs to you)“ [end]
[start] This is the way [end]
[start] Isn't that Louis Parkinson? [end]
[start] You just start typing stuff that is kinda referencing to what you want to do and use the autocomplete suggestions [end]
[start] "Hello. Our library checks if the string is a valid e-mail or not. Here is unneccessary and way too long API documentation. And our project is open-source. If you want to check it yourself, let's look up to our unneccessary imports and unneccessary argument checkers, so you can easily get lost while you are checking our minimal one function module. We even hid the most important aspects and made our function dependent, so you wouldn't just extend the class and couldn't override the function because f you!" [end]
[start] Holy hell, look at the 64 bits of precision on this analogy. [end]
[start] Meh, tbh most of the documentation are pure shit and went over the simplest and obvious stuff (if even)  My guess is that you will end up doing the same trial and error process you would’ve done without reading it so why bother? [end]
[start] Any decent library you can just let Intellisense guide you. [end]
[start] Louis just wants to flex. [end]
[start] Remember a few hours of hit and trial can save you several minutes of reading documentation. [end]
[start] This sub should be called BadProgrammerHumor [end]
[start] *Immediately looks at code examples and starts mashing into existing code* [end]
[start] ** Immediately write code using the examples **  *2 Weeks later, something breaks and you go back reading the docs*  Wait, I was supposed to also do all this pre-checks before using that function?  Too bad now you have built tons of stuff on top of that wrongly implemented piece of code. That's why you, at least, skim the documentation before writing.  However, a library that let you skip important parts of how it should be used, is a bad library. That's why react sucks. You can find such horrible applications written in react because it gives you "freeeeedooooom". [end]
[start] Met this guy! He trains at my bouldering gym and used to be on the UK national team [end]
[start] Several hours of trial and error can often save you five minutes of actually reading the docs. [end]
[start] That's pretty impressive. [end]
[start] Atleast it runs [end]

[start] Me in my AP class writing a paper but the wall is content learned via the class [end]
[start] It's the law!!!!! [end]
[start] Look, in the wild Nature there are no "documentations". Your heart needs to soar in the sky like the unfettered eagle it is suppose to be. Occasionally, you crash into the steel airplane of, "unsupported data type detected/illegal method/segmentation fault core dumped/your mother hates you". And that is okay. That's how we grow. [end]
[start] Me, standing behind the screen and watching: Must be programming god. [end]
[start] What is documentation [end]
[start] It really do be like that though. That is how it really do be. [end]
[start] Looks like me, except I'll probably fall flat on my face after 3 seconds [end]
[start] Real men don't read manual. [end]
[start] how do parents treat you? [end]
[start] Only error, no warning... It's fine [end]
[start] Seems it's fast [end]
[start] It feels like cheating, but I'm not certain why [end]
[start] I just wrote 300lines of code and was like "There has to be a better way to do this", took 5 minutes to read the docs... Turns out it was possible to do the exact same thing with 1 line of code.... [end]
[start] Ah yes, a Louis Parkinson climbing video. :) great stuff, check out Andrew McFarlane’s YouTube channel. Louis is also a trainer so check it out of you are in-around London and want to get into climbing. [end]
[start] sometimes his genius... its frightening [end]
[start] Hah! Jokes on you, there is NO documentation! [end]
[start] That way of climbing is probably unnecessary but it is absolutely 5Head [end]
[start] You have to work smarter, not harder. [end]
[start] This is everything ever written in Javascript. [end]
[start] watch out, we're dealing with a *professional* [end]
[start] Task failed successfully [end]
[start] "Oh, this function name seems like it will do what I want!" [end]
[start] Using the wall is allowed In bouldering. Technically this person just did any and every climb on that wall. [end]
[start] Example code is 1000% more helpful, I'd rather get working code and dissect why it works and how I can use it rather than look at documentation [end]
[start] [Nice awards you got there](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/foothk/trying_to_use_a_new_library_without_reading_the/) [end]
[start] How could someone take so long to read the README.md file? That's the only documentation one ever needs to read, right? Right? [end]
[start] I'm impressed [end]
[start] Why do it the right way when you can do it the way that works [end]
[start] Why would I spend 5 minutes reading docs when I can spend 30 minutes searching on the internet and waiting 6 hours for a mod at SO to mark my question as duplicate [end]
[start] I unironically use intellisense to learn a new library...  Unless I have absolutely no idea what the hell I'm supposed to do, in that case I will grudgingly open a new tab. [end]
[start] Nice [end]

[start] No that's just me trynna make my first game in unity without any prior experience of game development and a semi-average knowledge of programming. [end]

[start] Do a lot of you climb? I’ve noticed at my gym lots of the people that are regulars are engineers or programmers of sorts. I guess due to the problem solving nature of bouldering it attracts the crowd. [end]
[start] It is more fun to try stuff out and explore and have your expectations on how it should work be proven wrong. [end]
[start] Hi. Yes, this is true. We are lazy. [end]
[start] As a boulderer and a programmer: I'm glad to see I'm represented here, including my lack of reading documentation. [end]

[start] Interns doing documentation is a another level of stupidity xD [end]

[TITLE] I cried as hell [TITLE]
[start] I think as a class OS, a hardware class (using vhdl), and a class on scheme all made me cry more than data structures. [end]
[start] I’m taking this course at university ._. Any tips? [end]
[start] I hope the programmers that have been driven away by Java for whatever reason have at least taken a look at the data structures it provides. You have linked lists, arrays, hash sets/maps, and binary search tree sets/maps, as are in many other languages. You also have data structures that have been optimized for use in concurrent applications including skip lists and copy on write arrays. There are many valuable concurrency abstractions that will let you tailor your application to perform well on multi-CPU machines, and they're provided in the standard library. The same cannot be said for many other languages. [end]
[start] CLRS. [end]
[start] I don't know why people are complaining about Data Structures in Java, it's really not as bad as people make it out to be. [end]
[start] This was the class that made me realize I didn't want to do computer science.  Literally caused a 3-month long breakdown [end]
[start] This is probably the nicest, helpful data structures book so it could be a lot worse. So many examples. Only thing that bugs me was Its very hard to run any of the helpful data structure visualization programs because they are all applets. I eventually gave up trying to find a way to run them lol. [end]
[start] Data structures and algorithms was a fun course for me. I didn’t find learning about ADLs too difficult.  Analysis of algorithms, on the other hand... [end]
[start] I don't care what you say. This makes anyone cry.

[start] i graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2004 so its been a while since I saw any textbooks but today I was moving some boxes around and that textbook fell out of a box and on to the ground.  My buddy handed it back to me so I could put it away and I said "Fuck that book. "  Thats my story. [end]
[start] I thought data structures was bad until I started taking a hardware class. I have not done a single lab or assignment without crying. I’m actually considering changing my major because of how much I dislike it. [end]

[start] As a starter of webdev, I literally cried coz it took me 5days to figure out that I mispelled the qoute to quote. Every freakin day I was staring at my code and thought that nothing was wrong. I asked for my boyfriend (sr. wd) to help me and told me that my spelling between that words was wrong. Cried again when I made it right. Lol 😭 [end]
[start] I got through my cs degree using mostly java. I didn't think its was that bad  Edit: In case anyone was curious i thought LISP was much more confusing. [end]
[start] I still have my copy of the first edition [end]
[start] Now I want to read it... [end]
[start] To be fair, I've *never* seen a good data structures text book. [end]
[start] Where the hell you were doing before. [end]
[start] How many fucking times ffs [end]
[start] Any book required by the uni. [end]

[start] Honestly it depends on the professor. I absolutely loved data structures and assembly language. I passed both with A’s but when it came to discrete math I swear my professor was on straight crack. Our first exam was 3 hours long and only ten people finished in time. [end]
[start] Tears of joy! [end]
[start] Anything that has to do with Java, I hate with a passion. Just wish Android wasn’t dependent on it so we’d have been done with the language already. It’s same shit with Wordpress and PHP.  Flashbacks from university classes of this and analysis of algorithms. [end]

[start] Dropped the dictionary on my nads once, that made me cry. [end]
[start] As much as it sucked, data structures and algorithms was my first introduction into real computer science... you learn pretty complex data structures and learn the classical approaches to analysing complex alhorithms.  I wouldn't take it again, but I can't say it wasn't useful. [end]
[start] I mean, this book made me cry a few times, and even the name sounds like you just stubbed your toe:  [Dummit and Foote](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Abstract+Algebra%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780471433347) [end]

[start] Taking this class in C++ with the worst professor I think I've ever had. Super vague lab/homework directions, and now that all work is online, she's stopped lecturing completely (and doesn't answer questions). Having a super hard time with writing linked lists that need class objects for nodes and I can't even ask her questions because she only answers them during her office hours which she holds for two hours every week. Even worse, everyone is trying to ask her at the same time so you end up waiting in a queue until she gets to you or her two hours are up. We've made a discord server and everyone in the class are teaching each other because of how incompetant she is. Oh, and did I mention shes somehow the CS department head? Ahhhhhhsjdkeke. Ok thanks for reading my short vent. Love you. [end]
[start] I have read a few pages of this book. Quite disappointed, you should read Data Structures and Algorithms in Java 6th Edition by [Michael T. Goodrich](https://www.amazon.com/Michael-T-Goodrich/e/B001ITYBE8/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1)  (Author), [Roberto Tamassia](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_2?ie=UTF8&field-author=Roberto+Tamassia&text=Roberto+Tamassia&sort=relevancerank&search-alias=digital-text) , [Michael H.

[start] Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms Higham 2002 [end]
[start] I had to do data structures in c++ the same year I learned c++ because the University switched from Java to c++ that year. That was *really* fun. [end]
[start] That man is weak if he thinks that was a difficult book. [end]
[start] Screw Java. You can teach that exact class in c++ and learn more while spending half the time explaining the class structures because c++ has things like pointers which can make your life easier (when used correctly) [end]
[start] Hahahhaha I laughed out loud. [end]
[start] This is giving me Uni ptsd [end]
[start] This isn't a automata theory text book lamo [end]
[start] Very impressive. I can sympathize. [end]
[start] Bruh data structures is ezpz Freshman crap. Quit your bullshit [end]
[start] I'm glad I left Java and I'll never return to it. [end]
[start] Java is such an unpleasant language. [end]

[start] Kotlin might help, at least with some of that.  POJO? :  data class Customer (     val name: String,     val firstName: String,     val orders: MutableList<Order>,     var mutableVariable: Idklol ) Constructor, field assignments, get/set, equals, toString, hashCode, all there  Do I hear Singleton?  object OurSingleton { } And you don't even have to write INSTANCE when calling from kotlin.   You need lazy (synchronized or not thread safe)?  val dontInitToEarly by lazy { calculateIdk() }  Obviously it's not magic but it might help [end]
[start] This course in my university was a bit of a joke. It was all done in pseudo code without any consistency. Whenever the professor tried to show a few lines of Java out Python code to explain something, there were several mistakes in them and she didn't even get what the students wanted from her when they [end]
[start] Microelectronic circuits by Sedra and Smith [end]
[start] I read that book. It's actually one of the more accessible books on data structures and algorithms. I recommend it. Most other ones are too theoretical for me. [end]

[start] I did this course, but in C. I still feel the pure fear and horror. [end]
[start] I just got a 55 on my last data structures test, partially because I wasn't used to the new online format and ran out of time... I'm feeling pretty discouraged about it even though I got a 90 on the first one. [end]

[start] I love this book and still have it. [end]
[start] I have this book. Haven't used it much since I don't write Java often, but the OOP rundown near the front is pretty solid.  Maybe I'll crack it open and explore a bit this weekend just to feel the pain. [end]
[start] Fucking O chem for me. [end]
[start] Roloff Matek, Böge Mechanik/Physik, Lindner Mechanik/Physik :( [end]
[start] for real right now as we all need good book recommendations.  I recommended "The Art of Racing in the Rain".  About a race car driver who loses his wife and it's through the dog's eyes.  I promise you will cry. [end]
[start] Data structures and algorithms was actually a blast, but if I had a bad prof then I would probably hate it lol [end]
[start] This hit me in the feels [end]
[start] my copy of that book is held together with duct tape because i threw it on the ground so hard the binding ripped down the center. [end]
[start] Whaaaat I'm taking Data structures and algorithms right now and I prefer this book over the one my school assigns. Whenever I find myself in trouble I pull this bad boy out and find it easier to learn from. [end]
[start] This made me cry, but "Effective Java" made me bawl like a baby. [end]
[start] ++ [end]
[start] This whole "java bad" trend is getting pretty old. Reminds me of hating math in high school. Since a lot of teens don't know how or when to apply it, might as well hate it. [end]
[start] OS Structures and Compiler construction were the 2 worst by far. In my OS class we got into groups of 5 on the first day and our only assignment for the entire semester was to build a basic OS. It was brutal. 2 kids in my group didn’t even know C. I put so much effort into that class and we barely got a C-  And compiler construction is like half Linguistics and half programming. And my teacher didn’t know how to use email or PowerPoint (not even kidding). She was like 85 years old and learned programming with FORTRAN on punch cards back in the 60s. The entire class was failing at the end of the semester so she curved everyone’s final grade by 30 points. I’m guessing that’s what she does every semester [end]
[start] I still keep this book on my shelf  when I need to be humbled. [end]
[start] Only class I ever failed in college.  Took it again and got an A.  My professor was a fucking idiot. [end]

[start] Ahh Data Structures. Why I switched to an Engineering degree instead. [end]
[start] Omg!!! Lol [end]
[start] Assembly [end]
[start] Anyone read EOPL? probably the least I understood a book [end]
[start] SICP. Hands down. [end]
[start] Is it because it's Java that gonna make you cry? Or hardcover? [end]
[TITLE] Compiler Warning : Line 323 is kinda sus [TITLE]
[start] If only you could program with confirm ejects: on. [end]
[start] Line 31 was not a bug. 14 bugs remain.  Line 45 was a bug. 23 bugs remain. [end]
[start] I'd be all for ejecting line 323  If the code were longer than 60 lines. [end]
[start] All lines have been ejected. Seven bugs remain. [end]
[start] Finally a new meme format on r/ProgrammerHumor! [end]
[start] *New bug* reported by tester [end]
[start] Out of the loop, what does “sus” mean? [end]
[start] If all my code is red, does that mean it's all a bug? [end]
[start] git reset --hard origin/master  "That staged commit was totally sus." [end]
[start] How is it possible that a simple game like among us get so famous? [end]
[start] Start a petition to replace SonarQube messages with AmongUs Memes. [end]
[start] Program bug: If you slay me, 100 will take my place... [end]
[start] In this version, the impostors don't kill you but slowly drive you crazy by duplicating themselves out of nowhere [end]
[start] Frick it eject all lines, no lines no bugs [end]
[start] And if you debug the way people play Among Us, you get [FuckIt.js](https://github.com/mattdiamond/fuckitjs) - the "Javascript error steamroller." [end]
[start] "There are 100 bugs among us"  "Line 327 was not a bug"  "There are 101 bugs among us" [end]
[start] Nice meme, I laughed at it [end]
[start] *Line 131 was a bug*  14 Bugs Remain  *Line 275 was a bug*  83 Bugs Remain [end]
[start] You got it posted on twitter? So I can retweet? [end]
[start] 14 bugs? I thought there were only 12... Oh no. [end]
[start] uhh guys why is my code red [end]
[start] Don't see why my line is sus...  print_r($"Hello World"): [end]
[start] If there are over 300 lines and you start debugging at line 31, that would imply to me that you are going in order from top to bottom.   That means you have 30 lines of perfect code, and that's not too bad, all things considered [end]
[start] Props! This was a genuine chuckle for me. You absolutely captured the feeling of errors and debugging in a way that I can convey to my non-programmer friends! Legitimately grateful to have seen this meme and comments section. [end]
[start] Note that there were only 2 bugs before fixing line 31 [end]
[start] I don't play among us. Can anyone explain this meme? [end]
[start] Next round: Line 48 was not a bug, 18 bugs remain. [end]
[start] If my powers of deduction are correct, this means there were 13 bugs before line 31 was deleted. [end]
[start] Just because your program still won’t compile does not mean you didn’t fix a bug. [end]
[start] Knockout debugging, my favorite type. [end]
[start] Antivirus: your program is kinda sus [end]
[start] Can somebody create a compiler that does this? [end]
[start] You either need to learn to code correctly or increase those rookie numbers. Idk, feeling cute. Might delete later. [end]
[start] 99 maddening bugs in the my code  99 maddening bugs  Take one out, debug the lout  127 maddening bugs in my code [end]

[start] I was making a chess program. Here is an excerpt from  my thought process.   “Okay time to write code to keep pieces from jumping over each other”  *Make some code to detect other pieces and remove spaces from the path*  “Okay it’s not quite working”  *Move a couple equal signs*  “Okay now the pieces can do nothing but jump over each other, this is fine.” [end]

[start] i once had a mistake that caused the entire script to be errors turns out it was a case sensitive thing (rip 16 hours and some sleep)from a 15 programmen pls make sure ur writing stuff correctly [end]
[start] Can we please have more programmer humor like this? [end]
[start] Let's use 35 mins of our time to carefully check every variable and function in the program and their purpose, only later realise that you didn't include a neesed "#using" at the top [end]
[start] 🤪 [end]
[start] I saw this meme and thought was genius.  Then I thought of sending this to someone else so I could share a laugh but I know no one that plays this game and is a developer :( [end]
[start] Emacs does that with my makefiles [end]
[start] Lol as a coder I feel this. [end]
[start] Line 257 is a bug. Successfully fixed. 43 bugs remain. [end]
[start] Those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those numbers up [end]
[start] Line 32 was a bug 4023 bugs remain [end]
[start] alert(1); you fool [end]
[start] Imagine debugging like that.  Just awful. [end]
[start] c++ template errors: ejects everyone [end]
[start] No line was ejected in reality because there were only warnings [end]
[start] More like   Compiler: Line 31 kinda sus... 13 bugs remaining.  Dev: Eject line 31.  Compiler: Line 31 was a bug... 999 bugs remaining.  Dev: *Dead inside* [end]
[start] You forgot to append 0 to both those numbers. [end]
[start] This post is sus, I literally just got off among us when I saw this [end]
[start] My big brain ability is using the break points [end]
[start] What language are you using that your compiler can find bugs? [end]
[start] It's probably because line 12 is missing a ; [end]
[start] This is epic!!!!! [end]
[start] Good meme [end]
[start] Line 349 ejected. 431 bugs remain. [end]
[start] Lets report to devmates to vote for a line ejection [end]
[start] I read that as 141 bugs remaining and instantly thought that the number of bugs massively increased because of removal of that 1 line [end]
[start] I spent about 5 minutes explaining this to my wife and it was just about as enjoyable as seeing this, thank you. [end]
[start] I regret spending my free award in another shitty meme [end]
[start] Compiler : error in row 21  Me : *confused with only 12 rows* [end]
[start] Powershell be like [end]
[start] Wow, 323 lines... My lines are like 19 lines [end]
[start] guys I swear I saw line 50 was int and not char [end]
[start] Line 323 was a bug. 21 bugs remain [end]
[start] Line 42 was a bug. 30 bugs remain. [end]
[start] I'm just a highschooler learning basic java but this meme is still extremely relatable [end]
[start] Don't you just love it when errors pop up in the code for the library you are using. That's when you know you messed up [end]

[start] So I got one email account I can't sign into because my last log in was flagged as 'suspicious' and it wants me to verify my identity with a second email. One I only set up because the first account was demanding a back up email for recovery. So when I tried to log onto this other account it was flagged as suspicious because i hadn't even accessed it in years, and it sent an email to my primary account to verify it was me.  So. Two accounts. Each wants me to verify with the other before I can log in. To verify the other account.  Think I am pretty fed up with this whole security thing.  [end]

[start] I can never remember the question and half the time can't remember the answer either. I often use the same answer regardless if what question it was and the answer couldn't just be guessed because it isn't related to the question. Works for me.  [end]

[start] Favourite colour?  FFFFFFFF [end]
[start] I love the color picker with the 32 color limit of gifs. [end]
[start] Technically the only option that would make sense for the last security question is the last security question. If you chose that as your security question then that's the only answer that is correct and if you didn't choose it as your security question then none of them are correct. [end]
[start] I recently switched banks because they changed their online system to ask security questions instead of your password, years after I had been with them. I never got back into my account online because I had no idea what answers I made with the stupid security questions(Stupid things like who the first girl you kissed was). They don't even ask for your password.  [end]

[start] Actually color *could* be pretty secure. [end]
[start] Damn. I was really hoping after "What is your favorite color" it would next ask you about your quest and the flight physics of small birds. [end]
[start] oh yes, every single time you lost password it will certainly help you recall your exs' name. haha! [end]
[start] Oh my spaghetti wtf is this? [end]
[start] I love that this was such a smooth loop [end]
[start] I don't know that!  [end]
[start] *Oh God no.* [end]
[start] God damn it here we go again  [end]
[start] It's fucking beautiful! [end]
[start] Should have got an endless form of "Which security question do you choose?" [end]

[start] This was amazing [end]
[start]  Hey /u/dickdemodickmarcinko,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts. [end]
[start] The color one actually seems like a pretty cool idea [end]
[start] Well atleast my dad who left me for a pack of cigs wont be able to find my pornhub account. Oh sorry wrong thread [end]
[start] That's wonderful [end]
[start] Damn, I'm colour blind [end]
[start] I always just use the last word of the question as my answer.   [end]
[start] We had a system that did something like this. You entered your DOB then the database cast it to a datetime (yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss) for storage. The DOB would never match and we couldn't fix it cause out was a blackbox application. We gave up in the end and just removed the security question. [end]
[start] this made me cry out in horror [end]
[start] Finished designing the account recovery system, boss. [end]
[start] Ayyyy que guay the loop [end]
[start] Wow amazing idea! Never can hack this algorithm   [end]
[start] All I see is hunter2. [end]
[start] Oh god. The amount of accounts I have lost to security questions. [end]
[start] That gave me anxiety thinking how hard it would be to remember that [end]
[start] Bye Bye password.. [end]
[start] This made me cackle  [end]
[start] r/perfectloops [end]
[start] Lol [end]
[start] My name is George Agdgdgwengo [end]
[start] not a progamer but i too find humor in this [end]
[start] >Current date and time  Well, at least hackers from the future won't be able to hack my account... [end]
[start] This is just glorious. [end]
[start] Nice username OP. [end]
[start] Almost a perfect loop [end]
[start] We can do better, this should auto submit your guesses so you don't need the submit button [end]

[start] I was lost my password [end]
[start] They can't guess it if my answer is I'm blind! [end]
[start] password is must to keep things secure because security questions can be easily cracked.  [end]
[start] This is genius. [end]
[start] Brilliant  [end]
[start] Lmao [end]
[start] Haha that is awesome  [end]
[start] This is beautiful. [end]
[start] Mind blown  [end]
[start] green is not a creative color  [end]
[start] Guys, the way the colors are shown in the color picker. What is it called? Color depth issue? What is the technical name?  [end]
[start] Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 50) with your post! &nbsp;  *****  *^I ^am ^a ^bot, ^probably ^quite ^annoying, ^I ^mean ^no ^harm ^though*  *^Message ^me ^to ^add ^your ^account ^or ^subreddit ^to ^my ^blacklist* [end]

[start] No please. Not another one.  [end]
[start] And so the cycle begins anew [end]
[start] Nice new trend, but I really think you've already hit the originality ceiling [end]
[start] This is so frustrating.  I love it. [end]
[start] You are just trying to get into my pants! [end]
[start] What is the average flight speed of a swallow? [end]
[start] Beautiful. The .GIF color quantization makes the color picker take on the appearance of a Voronoi diagram. [end]

[start] We went deeper.  Let's keep going :) I love these [end]
[start] Actually one of my pet peeves is websites that have subjective questions instead of objective. It's easy to answer "What street did you grow up on" or "Mothers maiden name", but "who was your childhood best friend" and the like are ridiculous. [end]
[start] actually, what is your favorite color would be great if it displayed the hex value [end]
[TITLE] Naming is the most difficult part [TITLE]
[start] Then the next one can be j; [end]
[start] Just generate a UUID so you will have a very small chance of collision without any synchronization. [end]
[start] Give your kid a name that will make it through an AI résumé filter.  Also name them alphabetically so when someone sorts your kids, they always end up in age order. [end]
[start] Oh that's easy. child_2019_~~1~~0 [end]
[start]     temp; //todo: come up with more descriptive name [end]
[start]     for i in wife: [end]
[start] Little Bobby Tables of course [end]
[start] Foo. [end]
[start] Human human = new Human(name = 'human'); [end]
[start] Mmmm Variable? Var for friends. [end]
[start] how about this.Child? [end]
[start] If you thinking naming variables is hard, just wait until it's time to evict the kid from the cache. [end]
[start] I mean yeah, you have to make hard decisions like either naming a  user id variable  "userId" or  "userID" [end]
[start] I started a little sub a while ago for this...  * /r/NamingThings/  Kinda hard to get traction though, cause I guess we're usually pretty busy and focused and just want to get on with coding when the time comes.  But if it interests anyone, sub and post if you want some feedback on a naming decision. [end]
[start] Examples of my for loop vars   i ; increment ; inc ; another_inc ; inc_inc ; holy_fuck ; inc_inc_inc [end]
[start] The first decision is: camel case or underscores? [end]
[start] Kid1 [end]
[start] What about Jason? [end]
[start] "Ai" would actually be a fine name for a girl, if you were japanese. [end]
[start] Bro just name him foo [end]
[start]     new ChildFactoryManagerSingleton() [end]
[start] Child 1: test  Child 2: testt  Child 3: testtt  .... [end]
[start] Naming a kid is hard especially the older you are when you have kids. Every name your partner brings up you have to shut it down cuz you know someone with that name and they straight up suck. That’s how kids end up named Jamariqoi it’s virtual insanity. [end]
[start] "Kid1.name" [end]
[start] Me: What should we name the report?   Him: How about [REPTLDD.SAS](https://REPTLDD.SAS)  Me: We can use more than 8 characters! This isn't DOS. No wonder your kids have 6 character names. [end]
[start] name it /n [end]
[start] Can confirm.  Dev here. Wife also in IT.  Took 6weeks after 1st was born before we settled on a name, and 3weeks for our second born.  Having said that, we had SOoo many girl names we loved, but had two boys. [end]
[start] Textbox1 [end]
[start] Every year on his birthday you can bake a cake and write `i++` on it [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] You’ll be fine as long as you don’t make the same mistake Little Bobby Tables’ parents made. [end]
[start] productionBuildV1.yml [end]
[start] Enjoy it while it lasts, going to wake up one day and find typedef struct Child { } Adult; [end]
[start] `I` is alrrady a reserved keyword in English, akin to `this` or `self`. [end]
[start] **Human h1 = new Human();** [end]
[start] my\_human.  Or if you plan on having more, you could just start with Foo, Bar and Baz. [end]
[start] Now im just wondering if "kid A" as a follow up to OK computer was a variable naming joke. [end]
[start] Are we not typing variables anymore?  I can't keep up nowadays. [end]
[start] Call him Ike [end]
[start] Might I suggest DEADBEEF? [end]
[start] new3 [end]
[start] How about temp? [end]
[start] Name it COUNTRY ROAD [end]
[start] How about Soda , for a name ? [end]
[start] i++ [end]
[start] human1 sounds good. You can always change it later. [end]
[start] Boaty McBoatface. [end]
[start] Don't have kids... Problem solved [end]
[start] iHuman. [end]
[start] Baby baby = new Baby(); [end]
[start] I'd go with "Deprecated". That guarantees it will live on forever. [end]
[start] There are only two hard things in programming: naming variables, invalidating caches and mistakes by 1 [end]
[start] I've never been a fan of i. I've always preferred $x. [end]
[start] Foo [end]
[start] Naming it current can never go wrong. [end]
[start] Start with One.  Oh no, you're a programmer? Then of course you need to start with Zero.   Oh, wait: Nul? Null? Nil?  Now I know… You name your firstborn 0x0! [end]
[start] How about Kid_1; [end]
[start] tmp or temp are really good names [end]
[start] I can only have 3 children because they're going to be called human_new, human_newer and human_newest [end]
[start] This is why you always go with a descriptive name, so the choice is obvious: baby\_human\_0 (unless that already exists, in which case increment as appropriate). [end]
[start] Birthday cakes will be simple enough too, just write "i++". [end]
[start] Because it's an int-fant? [end]
[start] The semicolon at the end is just the perfect cherry on top [end]
[start]     myHuman [end]
[start] We are all I are we not? [end]
[start] aHuman, aSweetHuman if you're getting emotional, but I would recommend sobriety. [end]
[start] My wife is also pregnant due January next year. What prefix should I use for a human? Is humBaby1 good? [end]
[start] Array<Child> children = new Array<Child>();  children[0] = new Child();   done [end]
[start] This is actually funnier as a mathematician because then the kid would be imaginary... [end]
[start] Just call it Bob & be done with it. [end]
[start] If tytanic is any indication poor baby [end]
[start] Well, you have first, middle and last names, and eventually maybe a nickname. Best not to limit him or her, just declare an array i(). [end]
[start] Make a spreadsheet of all your name ideas, hit random 3 times and let the God's decide. [end]
[start] The three most common difficulties in programming are naming conventions and off-by-one errors [end]
[start] Camel Case! [end]
[start] Go check on temp, item. [end]
[start]  Stick it straight in to a list and then only address it by it's index.     children[0] forever [end]
[start] call the child const foo = bar; [end]
[start] Well a good variable name is descriptive. So either boy/girl, or even just human. [end]
[start] There was an attempt to name a boy "БОЧ рВФ 260602" which was abbreviation for russian "biological human object of kind Voronin-Frolov born at june 26 2002"  https://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%9E%D0%A7_%D1%80%D0%92%D0%A4_260602 [end]
[start] resultStr; [end]
[start] Maybe better than Foobar? [end]
[start] "Hello World, Smith" [end]
[start] Maybe flag; [end]
[start] bool poop\_on\_diaper = false; [end]
[start] Just remember: Upper Camel Case.   Nobody wants: jEssica, or iGor, or fredRick, or chris\_topher. [end]
[start] Damn, that's cold. i is for throwaways. Dooming the kid to a case of the SIDS. [end]
[start] A lot of people are suggesting more letter names and what not, but I was taught to use descriptive variable names. I suggest waiting till you see the lil guy and choosing a name on the first thing you notice. Something like "cry baby" would do [end]
[start] let tyanicJr = new Child(); [end]
[start] Just make sure not to do Hungarian notation. We don't need any kids walking around with names like "grlFemale1." [end]
[start] temp [end]
[start] Ah just name it t for temporary and never change it [end]
[start] This directly violates the Microsoft recommended best practices for baby naming.  i is traditionally reserved for iterators. Baby names should be self documenting and either camel cased or Pascal cased. [end]
[start] I had a dispute with one of my coworkers this week and naming variables seem to be the one thing we both can’t agree on every time I send my changes up for PR. But I agree with him anyway because I’m too lazy to argue and just want my changes merged faster [end]
[start] My go to default variable name is "bob", so I guess I got this covered. [end]
[start] Wonder what his wife's reaction would have been had he declared that i, within the block of a for loop. [end]
[start] These are my children Temp1 and Temp2 [end]
[start] My little temp is turning 4 this year and is the apple of my eye [end]
[start] Same as last name, but don't capitalize the first letter. [end]
[start] At least it's not "tmp" [end]
[start] Happy Birthday to little Hello_World. [end]
[start] var myInfant; [end]
[start] Pro-tip: name them ii and jj.  It's easier to search for those than just a single character [end]
[start] If u can't come up with a name ...just pick by the meaning and don't look at the name first.  Parenting a kid with the same name as 30 kids  in one store ...that's what u don't want.  My buddy loves MXPX named his daughter LINOLEUM. . after the song. [end]
[start] Give with the d and getting a little i. [end]
[start] I just named my son Nolan after Nolan Ryan..u can use it if u like buddy. [end]
[start] At least they acknowledge its not `err` [end]
[start] 0 or Zero, because everyone knows that child arrays start at zero. [end]
[start] Well, bobby tables obviously. [end]
[start] // TODO [end]
[start] why name him? just put him in a Set and you can just apply a single lambda function to them and take care of them all at once. [end]
[start] Dollar-I [end]
[start] ++Tytanic ;DROP TABLES [end]
[start] self [end]
[start] How about FooBar? [end]
[start] Considering how much we copy and paste, pretty sure the name will end up being acctBalance [end]
[start] 1001001SOS perhaps? [end]
[start] Just google names until there's no results, or the only results you'll find are my made-up names.  Like "Tienrefan" or "Zerfereloch". [end]
[start] So have your wife do the naming. [end]
[start] Naming a kid start at family names unless the name is to odd for where you are living. Try to keep the spelling standard, a name that most people can say also a popular name but not the most popular so when they go to school, you do not want there name to be the same as five other people in the class. But I think try to be kind we all know how shitty people can be. Best of luck with your new adventure [end]
[start] Obligatory xkcd: https://xkcd.com/327/ [end]
[start] Convention dictates you shouldn't use single-letter child names. [end]
[start] //FIXME [end]
[start] What about Little Timmy or LT for short? [end]
[start] Son and dad in the car.  Son: why is my sister named Lily?  Dad: that was all your mother was able to think of.  Dad sweating profusely....  Son: why am I named temp? [end]
[start] Inti [end]
[start] Tytanic++ [end]
[start] Wish I was smart enough for this sub [end]
[start] If it’s a girl, Denise. If it’s a boy, Thenephew. [end]
[start] var1 [end]
[start] In our culture we name the first kid by his grandpa’s name or her grandma’s name. [end]
[start] /Dev/null [end]
[start] Come on we all know it’s really imissyoudad [end]
[start] X works fine too [end]
[start] Just put it in a list, no need to name the baby now [end]
[start] String nameOfFirstBorn; [end]
[start] Poor kid is going to have so many digestive problems with only a semicolon [end]
[start] "test" will be fine [end]
[TITLE] Java is the best [TITLE]
[start] Why is there a trend of mocking java? Genuinely asking. [end]
[start] “There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.”  ― Bjarne Stroustrup [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Catch exception and return to caller. Or in other words, fire your boss. [end]
[start] That explanation for Java is essentially what I told the interns when they asked why I made a webpage with JSP. [end]
[start] More like "If your boss tells you you're fired, I hope you know Java". [end]
[start] But.. but.. I like java. Maybe that’s an unpopular opinion but if it works it works [end]
[start] My favorite programming language is the one where pay me money to use it. [end]
[start] The best language is the one that gets the job done correctly. You don't throw out old tools because they're useless right now, you might need it in the future. [end]
[start] Most of the people who hate on Java don't even know why they don't like it, they just see other people saying it and parrot that opinion. If you asked them to give reasons, most of them wouldn't know what to say other than "I saw it on Reddit". [end]
[start] Somehow on this subredit most seem to think that Java is the worst language ever but if you hate JS you just don't know it enough/are bad at it... [end]
[start] Assembly ia superior [end]
[start] You should see the apps we have in Java, serving more than 2 billion requests daily with 8 machines and a potato, executing business logic of thousands of lines of code in less than 1 ms and streaming all the data to the warehouses. Java is a powerful and cool language if used correctly and with modern techniques, frameworks and libraries. Of course it's horrible if you have to maintain a 90's applet or a desktop app but if you are using Hadoop stacks for example I think it's quite cool and powerful. Would rather code in Java than in node, python or php for example. Easier to understand and onboard new people, adapt and add features in my opinion. [end]
[start] It's also weird the assumption that you always have a say in the matter of picking a language or can go around switching jobs to accommodate your programming tastes. Lastly, how is it programmer humor if it's mocking programmers who work with or even like Java. [end]
[start] The iOS version of this:  If you have extensive (5-10+ years) experience developing iOS apps, do it in either Objective-C or Swift.   If you're new and want to learn, use Swift.   If your boss tells you "do it in React Native or you are fired", outsource it to China and look for another workplace. [end]
[start] If you need a portable application where execution speed is moderately important, then use java. If you use C then you’ll be rewriting the code for every target platform, and if you use python it will most certainly be too slow. [end]
[start] - If you want to shoot yourself in the foot, use C.  - If you want to blow your leg off, use C++.  - If you want the virtual machine to explode, use Java.  - If you've written software for a while, get D&D insurance. There is no best option. You know something will explode.  edit: If you want to see it explode from orbit, deploy it to the cloud! [end]
[start] No one should be writing full applications in python. [end]
[start] So how does C# fall in this list? [end]
[start] Java is the best. [end]
[start] What about LUA? [end]
[start] Here is another Java hatter [end]
[start] In my experience ppl that are making jokes about Java usually have no clue about programming in real life. No real developer I know makes those jokes but always script kiddy’s or college freshman’s. [end]
[start] Is Java not good enough? [end]
[start] My university progamming course teaches us C and my prof says that she hates C++ because "they took a perfectly good progamming language and ruined it." [end]
[start] Java is terrible, i have javascript [end]
[start] That's why I code in C#. It's a lot like Java, but everyone just assumes Bill Gates has you by the balls. [end]
[start] I don't understand why people are mocking Java, still it's one of the best programming language for cross-platform development and for enterprise application development. [end]
[start] Eh I like server side java. The new spring boot framework is amazing and can handle the ecosystem in a really structured way. I guess if you are talking about the older applets and jsps its a different story.. [end]
[start] I loooove java [end]
[start] I have had jobs coding in all 4 of the languages mentioned. You can write bad code in any language, but I would take coding in Java over C++ any day. C++ has 50 ways to do everything and gazzilon ways to shoot your self without realizing it.  Java as a language is fine. It is all the over-engineered, enterprisy, Spring based gigantic code bases that give it a bad rap. [end]
[start] Like ItsBoris once said... 'If u start learning to code and u begin with Java, it's like learning to ride a bike. But you are only 2. And there are not support wheels. You have to ride uphill all the time and ur bike is on fire. On top of that the wheels are deflated... But it gets better... Once u know it better u get a bell.' It's the most accurate explanation I ever heared. [end]
[start] Hey, quit picking on java! I like java [end]
[start] Java bad [end]
[start] Imagine writing C  This comment was made by Nim gang [end]
[start] Rustaceans triggered by the C and C++ use cases [end]
[start] Simpllyfied: They hate us cause they ain't us!  On a more serious note... Java has been a araound a long time. It changed and adapted over time. It competes with all other languages, Frontend/backend/typed/multiplatform... And it's pretty good at competing with all of them. In each category the specialized language will win. Bu if you include multiple, sometimes comüeting concepts, java usually comes out on top. That's why it's a usually a good management decision, but might not be the best toool that available for one specific job.  I think thats where a lot of developer frustrations comes from. Because they want to use one of the best tools to solve a problem. Not he one tha's  pretty good at solving all of them.   As an Ops dude that'sthe reason why stuff like Microsoervices is a pleasure. Everyone get's to use his/her optimal tool, and you yourself gotta make sure your build environemnt works. If it runs in a container we're good (Though I still won't get off your back if you don't pin your package dependencies...) [end]
[start] I’ve heard that Flash is all the rage, these days. [end]
[start] I love java :( [end]
[start] what about c#? [end]
[start] After reading all of this I'm confused. I'm 15, no way near a real programmer, but I know Java, Koltin, Swift, Dart and Javascript and out of all them I still prefer Java. Is it really that hard to update your Java version as stop using deprecated shot? You can't hate a language because 10 years ago applets made you cry lol. [end]
[start] Depending on the compiler C runs faster than C++ Also depends on how it’s written [end]
[start] Okay I'm barely out of high school but have been attached to java for a long time but formally only for 2 years and seeing this makes me shit scared . Am I wasting my time learning it ? (PS I do have intrest in building Android apps (the reason I started with java in the first place)) [end]
[start] I personally use Java and I encounter no problems with it. I just think that it's too complicated for a programming language. [end]
[start] I had a job as a UI developer and I was tasked with designing implementing one of the most complicated UI I've ever even seen  My boss made me do it in GWT, which was googles idea about how to compile JAVA INTO JAVASCRIPT  Just thinking about it makes me want to vomit in my mouth a little bit, and I left the team shortly after this  I created that feature almost a decade ago, and nobody has the guts to try and replace it, and GWT? Google has completely taken it offline, my former company now has to maintain their own copy of the framework internally, because it was that bad  I actually took JAVA off of my resume because I never want to work with it again if I can avoid it [end]
[start] Java OP [end]
[start] FIRST TECH CHALLENGE v i b e s [end]
[start] My university decided the primary language we ought to learn was Java, and so far it seems like they didn’t do us any favours lol. [end]
[start] I personally love Java. The way it does object-oriented stuff is great. At least that's been my experience. [end]
[start] Jokes aside, honestly, use any language that‘ll allow you to become fucking invaluable.  I’d rather a genius Visual Basic .NET geek come work for me than some half-assed Dart poser.  Your direct reports will thank you for hiring someone who is competent and knows what they’re talking about. [end]
[start] Java-ecosphere has the best IDE, best build and depency tools and best open source server, fight me. Language itself is ok, at least it requests you work with OOP principles. All performance issues have become mute because of hardware improvements. [end]
[start] I interpreted that as changing jobs because of a hostile work environment, not for Java’s fault. Java’s not even a bad language. I don’t even use Java and I will still argue assembly is 20x worse. [end]
[start] Nah fam we use Rust now [end]
[TITLE] This guy knows what's up. [TITLE]

[start] > 3 Billion Devices Run Java  That's the only time I've seen a warning message being displayed with pride. [end]
[start] Java device can literally means a security token, a smart lock, some sharing bicycle, hell, even a automatic cake baking machine.

[start] Some companies fucked up when they followed the open work environment band wagon.  [end]
[start] I worked at home for a couple of years.  My wife couldn’t understand why I dreaded snow days and spring break so much.  The younger a child is, the shorter the gaps are between the moments where they have to ask you something.  I would be a nervous wreck on those days; on the edge of my chair dreading the inevitable interruption. [end]
[start] And that's why managers have secretaries, as a director I always have a full line of people on fire, if it wasn't for my secretary it would be absolutely impossible to handle it.  What she really does is answering all request immediately and prioritize and schedule them so that te guy making the request at least knows immediately when he'll get the answer and if something is truly urgent it's actually her call to interrupt me.  That requires at least as much understanding of the company and the workflow as I have. She makes half of what I do. [end]

[start] This hit way too close to home [end]
[start] It is for this very reason that I started separating the engineering / architecture process from the coding. I use a whiteboard or paper for the former so that interruptions are not as disruptive. Because the mechanics have already been determined, the implementation requires far less working memory in the brain so that interruptions are, again, not as disruptive. [end]

[start] Me playing "Into the Breach" [end]
[start] While I understand this feeling, and it's clearly common enough since this idea gets reposted all the time, it's indicative of flaws in workflow more than an inescapable reality of programming.  If someone wrote 300 lines without saving and then the computer crashed and he lost it all, you'd call him foolish for not backing up the work as he went.  Why then wouldn't you divide complex problems into small manageable chunks and write/diagram your progess while you work it out?  If an interruption knocks you back to square one, you really need to be taking some notes.  Likewise if you're trying to write code and it's taking 15+ minutes to understand what it needs to to, you probably haven't broken the problem into small enough chunks and the code you're writing is probably going to be tough to maintain because it's doing too much in one place and requires too much mental effort to unpack. [end]
[start] i love the little guy in the second picture he looks so focused and cute lmao. [end]
[start] I even experience this as a graphic designer.  I had a boss that never understood this. When I'm balls deep 6 hours into a project adding things, moving things, rearranging things, undoing and redoing shit, locking objects temporarily to edit other objects, creating complex effects that require 25+ steps to get there, layering objects in front of and behind eachother and you want me to "just come help with this thing for 10 minutes" I end up getting back to my desk and have no fucking idea where I was. [end]
[start] This is why you keep a small whiteboard by your computer and draw things and note things down so it's not purely in perishable mushy brain memory.  Stop punishing yourselves, youre only slowing yourself down and then blaming everyone around you. Software engineers are not special snowflakes with a uniquely difficult problem to solve. Many disceplins and fields are just as complex or more so with higher stakes and they just don't work stupidly. [end]

[start] psychology likes to talk about short and long term memory, similar to ram and hard drive space, but they neglect the fact that in practice there are several intermediary steps.  what you are using when focusing on the task is short term memory. which you then dump upon hearing you are being requested for a new task that will take your attention and short term memory to process through.  the real trick to bypassing the loss of this memory is to take advantage of the second stage of memory storage to hold onto what you were working on, before allowing your short term memory to dump and free up for a new task.  i'm not saying this is easy, but it is a thing the brain can do; it can be practiced to make it easier, and more natural.

[start] Stick your tongue out of your mouth slightly, it's theorized to be an evolved behavior to communicate concentration. Also it weirds some people out and they'd be more likely to go back to their desk and send an email. [end]
[start] This is why I love working remote. Mute slack notifications after 10:30 and manually check them whenever I come to a natural pause. [end]
[start] This is why open plan offices are _such a good idea_.   We should have more of them. So we can all get less done.   I used to go work in the art library at my university for this reason:   a) wasn't interested in books, and  b) nobody I knew so no interruptions, and  c) no wireless (at the time).   Now I just flat-out tell people that I don't answer emails or other requests when I'm in the flow. There is no such thing as an emergency email, and I don't send those, either.  [end]
[start] I have had a surprising amount of luck combatting this problem by:  1. Establishing an official process for how support-related questions should be handled.  2.  Training several reliable people in most of the non-programming things that I know, and making them part of the official process.  3. Scolding people when they don’t follow the process and come straight to me anyways. This includes telling them straight up that every hour I spend with them is an hour that isn’t put toward whatever bug or new feature they want. I’m not mean or cold about this, but as calm and direct as I can manage.  4. When all else fails, closing my door (thank glob I have one!) turning on my music, turning off email notifications, and signing out of IM.  It’s not a perfect system, but it’s better than it used to be for me. [end]

[start] This happens in an open floor plan office every 10 minutes. It’s quite the rage at my company but finally some teams  are seeing what it does for personal productivity and are reverting to personal spaces. I loved my own office. Door closed; deep concentration for hours. Now I’m in an open space with 30 folks constantly talking. Very hard to do any work that requires an extended time of concentration. [end]
[start] Legitimately had to check if that was posted here or in r/ADHD, a sub which I also frequency is equal to the inverse of wavelength. Isn't maths interesting?  Also, I I legitimately had to check if this was posted here, or in r/ADHD. We feel your pain, programmer bros. [end]

[start] for all the larpers from /r/all:   automate a process that attempts to access a competitors website using Internet Explorer 6, the oldest shittiest one we can still pretend to run, via a virtual machine.    if they notice it in their analytics, they will decide they need to make their website accessible on this dinosaur software. it will not go well for them. [end]
[start] I remember a web app I had to use for work that wasn't fully compatible with any browser. If you wanted to use feature A, you'd have to use Chrome, feature B would only work in Firefox, feature C would sometimes work in Edge and sometimes in IE but it seemed to be a coin flip as to which one.

[start] What is an IE6 VM? [end]
[start] Use curl and change the user agent on the request header, a lot easier than spinning up a VM. [end]
[start] Pure devil :D [end]
[start] I look at IE6 traffic numbers and laugh thinking of other people's misery as they attempt to browse the web on some ancient corporate  or government PC with no other approved browsers and locked down software. [end]
[start] Whenever I'm on our competitors website I click randomly around the screening. I can see they are using hotjar so I'm slightly throwing that off (really slightly 😂) [end]

[start] I worked for a major IT firm and was sent to a client site to work for a while. I worked for them remotely and would visit every month or two. Their internal businesses applications were all forced to support IE6, and IE was the official company supported browser. :-( True, this was years ago, but I'm willing to bet change has been slow.

[start] Every now and then I like to go to a site using Lynx just for the lulz [end]

You're the leading expert in the field. You must be because no-one else has a clue. That's why they're telling you to Google. Try not to collapse under the pressure, because there isn't any. It's OK. It's not like anyone's going to try to beat you to the punch.  Put a note somewhere online that mentions the mediafire URL, the fact it wasn't on archive.org, and your findings. *Especially* your findings.  Oh and maybe donate to archive.org anyway. They're doing good work. [end]

[start] *"Use the search feature you moron!! This is my awesome forum where I demonstrate iamverysmart!!!"* [end]
[start] The one that infuriates me more is when I post a detailed explanation of my problem including explaining that I've already tried some other solutions, *abc* and *xyz*, I found while searching.   Then the first answer is "Have you tried doing *abc* or *xyz*?"   I wanted to shove my hand through the internet so I could physically slap the face of the man who last did this to me on the Microsoft Answers forum.  [end]
[start] 2027 - an aging StackOverflow begins shuttering after its purchase by Yahoo three years prior. Within weeks, 176 independent archives of the full catalogue of SO questions and answers appear online.  2028 - over a million copies of the SO archive exist. Only three or four sites get more than a dozen hits a month, but StackOverflowArchive.com takes most of the traffic. SOA has a strict policy of Archive Only for reasons only the devs can fathom, and sites such as KeepItGoing.ru can't seem to get the same loyalty or return traffic.  2030 - KIG.ru is shut down due to lack of funding. Only 200+ copies of the 2027 archive exist online in any usable searchable form.  2032 - SOA.com's only server maintenance person is killed in a tragic traffic accident caused by the newest Edison X autopilot software beta deployed to every car worldwide that morning. In the confusion, SOA's server bill doesn't get payed because no one knows which Bitcoin wallet to use.  2033 - traffic is splintered heavily between the remaining ten StackOverflow archival sites, with no one able to capture enough traffic to pay the bills.  2034 - the last publically accessible SO archive shuts down. Some traces exist in caches, buried in archive.org, or represented in XKCD archives as images of text. If you happen to have one of the problems captures in one of these places, and you have the skills enough to dig them out your problems might be solved, but for the little people the problems start mounting up, cascading.  2035 - devs worldwide finally admit to the world during the year that had become known as "The year of no new features" that no one really knows how to program any more, and that they've all just been treading water since the shut down of StackOverflowArchive.com. A taskforce is set up by the WHO to find and piece together every SO question and answer they can find and rebuild.  2036 - the taskforce hits a snag when they can't figure out why the parser they're using is throwing an error. Ironically it's stuck parsing the very same question that they currently have, but there are no answers, the question is sitting at -1 and the only comment is of someone posting the "not a good fit for StackOverflow" notice.  2037 - civilization ends.

[start] "Here is a python library I cross compiled for the raspberry pi zero before the PIP bug is fixed"  *clicks link*  <library_for_x86> [end]
[start] My favorite is when the forum migrates to an updated database.  "Sorry, those links are dead because we changed our forum and didn't see the need to move all the old answers over. Besides, those are old, so if they still have the problem I don't think they need it answered any more."   rage [end]
[start] Fucking mediafire  [end]
[start] "Error: Only members can see this link. Sign up today, it's free!"  And then you sign up.  "Error: Your account must be approved by a mod before it is activated."  Last post was in 2012. [end]
[start] On Reddit now it's   >This comment has been overwritten by a script to protect the users privacy. [end]
[start] Then there's the reverse. When you find a thread by a guy explaining a common error. Then you have people throughout the years saying "[Current Date] and this post is still helping people". [end]
[start] "PM'd you the solution" [end]
[start] This is actually better now that there are more popular dedicated sites like stack overflow and git, etc. Not like years ago when it was just bbs and forums.   But... let's see what happens when all our stuff is archived lol take that next generation! [end]
[start] Or when someone asks a question and there's 25 replies and six pages of telling them it's the wrong thread for that question or that it was answered elsewhere instead of just telling the fuking answer again [end]
[start] One time, I ran into a really unique issue I've never seen before and googled it. Clicked the first link Google gave me.  Turns out, it was a link to a post **I** made like 5 years ago asking the same question. I got the solution from my past self. [end]
[start] My personal favourite is "uze De serch function omg"  [end]
[start] Don't forget about all the Photobucket images that are now locked behind a paywall for third-party website hosting. [end]
[start] \> Opens new SO issue  \> Closed as duplicate, linking to archived thread [end]

[start] Nvm I fixed it [end]
[start] That fix isn’t valid for the current version anyway [end]
[start] Jesus yes. All the fucking time. [end]
[start] I've had a few of these scenarios where it was *my* question and *I* had solved it in the past and found *my* post.  There are a few questions I've had (mostly with modding games) that I am apparently the only person to have EVER wondered, because I've come across them a few times.  [end]
[start] User 1: I’m having an issue with <problem>  User 1: nvm i fixed it  ARCHIVED 2/23/2011 [end]
[start] At least you know it's possible.   If I'd get a penny for every open source program that is really cool but *NOT AT ALL DOCUMENTED* where you have to go through thousands of lines of stupid interface stuff and other people's code just to find out if what you want is even possible.  Edit: Then I'd be rich [end]
[start] Even if it was up, you'd have to contend with Mediafire, with all of its popup blocker evasions and ads all over the place. [end]
[start] GitHub user: "Hey I'm having problem with x"  Dev: "Confirmed problem, fixed in new patch"  GitHub user: "Thanks it worked!"   Me, 5 months a four patches later searching for the exact same problem:"fuck" [end]
[start] “Have you tried this? <you must login/register before viewing any links> [end]
[start] "JUST FUCKING GOOGLE IT YOU LAZY MORON!" Yeah well what do you think did I try to do all of this time? But all I stumble upon are unanswered questions from 1999 on the same forum. [end]
[start] "nvm solved it"  "how?"  "I pm'd you the fix" [end]
[start] This is why it's super important to be a good guy programmer. Next time you fix a bug or figure out one of these horrors, make sure to revisit the places that gave you inspiration and in the event that there's no solid answer, take five minutes and help out all dem future devs :) [end]
[start] Me: searching google for issue with my computer  "Oh a forum post with the same exact problem i have."  All of the responses: "Google it!", "Do you know what google is?", "Have you tried google?" [end]
[start] Had something like this on DreamInCode.net a while back.  I posted a question years ago to which some kind people posted answers and someone posted a link. I thanked them and that was basically the thread.  Until I believe roughly 8 years later someone posts to say that the link is dead... I hadn't been on dic.net for so long I had to reset my password to log in and tell the person that the thread was 8 years old so links were likely outdated.  I believe the DIC admin even replied to the thread saying it made him laugh.  Good times. [end]
[start] This joke is older than 1995. [end]
[start] The other thing I hate is when you start talking to someone who knows something you want to know, but when you ask they just tell you to Google it. If Google answered the question as well as another human-fucking-being, I would have already had my answer and not asked you! [end]
[start] My absolute favourite is  Q: Hello, I was wondering how to do this thing?  A: don't do that [end]
[start] Or it's a download link to done download site where it's blocked behind a fucking survey that doesn't do shit to "unlock" your download link [end]
[start] If the user posting the fix isn’t banned and his post deleted. [end]
[start] "No problem! I'll PM you the solution."  This makes me want to track you down and murder you. [end]

So different companies have been taking the reigns, and subsequently dropping them. Looking up who the fuck I’m supposed to call is going through 8 year old forum pages and calling businesses that no longer exist. [end]
[start] And whenever I get so desperate as to ask myself, I usually find a solution or workaround myself.  [end]
[start] "pm´d you the solution". I have unironically seen this multiple times. [end]
[start] Then when you ask again someone tells you to piss off and check the archive  [end]
[start] Forum user 3: Hey I have this unrelated issue, can we derail this thread and solve that and leave OP answerless?  Forum: Okay! [end]

[start] Reminds me of when I was having controller issues while trying to play Furi.  Found several threads with the same issues but no answer. Made my own thread, still no fix. But then an idea struck, and when I tried it the problem was fixed.  I hurried back to the other threads (including my own) to tell them the solution. No responses.  I then spent a couple of hours of the course of a few weeks to make a video tutorial.  The video currently have 3 like, that means I was able to help at least 3 people. Completely worth it.  Link to the video in case anyone is wondering: https://youtu.be/u4ggTegnkYc [end]

[TITLE] What SHOULD happen. [TITLE]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Not sure which is worse, these people, or the people who post links to other forum posts instead of answers, and then you click the link and they're dead, but everyone else who had that problem stands by that being the solution. [end]
[start] "I have problem X."  "Why don't you google it?"  **Two Years Later**  Post becomes top result on Google [end]
[start] "The solution is right here [longdeadlink.com](http://unintelligiblegobbledigook.net/) google it before asking."  Can get fucked as well. [end]
[start] Also, I google how to solve X and find this kind of thread:  Question: "How to solve X?"  Answer: "What are you *really* trying to do?"  Reply to answer: "I'm trying to do Y"  Reply of the reply: "Oh, so here is how you do Y"  WHAT? NO X? FOR FUCKING SAKE I NEED FUCKING X, TO THE HELL WITH YOUR Y! [end]
[start] Wait I don't get this post...   Edit: oh wait, I figured it out. Nvm, it's cool.  [end]
[start] Kind of related but I really hate when I am searching for the solution the the problem and all the comments are like "use the search function next time this has already been posted" I fell personally attacked like THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING ASSHOLE!!! [end]
[start] Relevant XKCD: [https://xkcd.com/979/](https://xkcd.com/979/) [end]
[start] If it was me, it just started working again and I had no idea why.  And then a year later, it happens again, and I'm reading through my old notes hoping I wrote down the solution to it. Nope. And this time it doesn't "just start working again." [end]
[start] The worst is when you realize it was your post and you forgot how to solve it. [end]
[start] *"Can someone help me figure out this problem?"*  *"Omg yes I have the same problem"*  *"Me too"*  *"Help pls"*  *"Bump"*  *"Guys, anyone know yet?"*  *"Rly wanna know, I have the same issue"*                             Page 1 of 34    [end]
[start] Obligatory [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/979/). [end]
[start] He did provide 1 piece of useful information:  His post shows that a solution exists in polynomial time. [end]
[start] I personally hate the classic "this thread gets made once a week" posts. But google literally directed me to this one first why are you like this? [end]
[start] In 2 hours?  Come on to fix a basic problem i take at least 2 days. Why? Because im incompetent! And a shitty programmer! [end]
[start] At least when you struggle with your Iphone all you find are threads with people who never figured it out. [end]
[start] I used to love going on older Reddit threads getting info. Now they all say "this comment has been overwritten by a script to protect the users privacy". [end]
[start] Nah what’s even worse is when literally one person ever has experienced the problem you’re having and their question is from five years ago and unanswered. [end]
[start] Its the same with people who answer on a post with „i have this problem too need help“. [end]
[start] I don't mind this as much as the idiots on Stack Overflow.  At least in this case, you could theoretically PM the guy and ask what he did. Whereas on SO if the answer isn't there already, you're shit out of luck. [end]
[start] Or the worst addition anybody could make "Works fine for me" [end]
[start] Literally worse than Hitler. [end]
[start] I always post working code when saying it works now. Maybe others can improve it further. And it's annoying when I read an entire solved thread without solution included. [end]
[start] I would absolutely vote for ANYONE who promised to make this a law. [end]
[start] you got 2 hours to figure it out or TitsMcGee4782 is a better person than you  the clock is ticking, poser [end]
[start] Like when you're helping some folk on a misterious bug that starts to bother you... And he goes "ok solved" and disappears [end]
[start] Stack overflow is moving in that direction. :)  While I rarely ask questions there, it's rather amusing to search for some rare, hard to solve problem, and find that the only response in the poster himself, either NOT responding, or responding and not giving details.  People like that need to be banned from the internet.  EDIT:  By rare, I actually mean 1 time since SO was launched, and my \*\*\* \*\*\*\* question was never answered.  By anyone.  It turned out to be a CVE. [end]
[start] You can call it cruel, but you cannot call it unjust. [end]
[start] StackOverflow. [end]
[start] Yeah well you know I posted a solution to my problem that I discovered and my solution and question both got downvoted and then I got a comment from some moderator saying don’t answer your own questions, so now I just don’t ask questions at all. [end]
[start] Tits McGee you little shit [end]
[start] > This has been asked many times, just Google it  This was the first result, unhelpful Stackoverflow user.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] It is justified [end]
[start] Is this a rage thread? Because that's what I'm feeling after I read half the comments. [end]
[start] Then you go on youtube and find a kid with a shitty mic who fixes that problem in less than 5 minutes [end]
[start] That’s Article 13 in a nutshell  [end]
[start] He needs to be Skinned, raped and killed in that order. [end]
[start] hey can you help me out with this issue  "uses google and software of usb"  There you its fixed  wow your good at computer stuff  Yea im in IT  "makes it look like he is a software engineer" [end]
[start] He's getting off light. [end]
[start] How am I supposed to get my CS degree with this guy around, smh [end]
[start] Hang him [end]
[start] What should happen is I should not get a random useless notification  [end]
[start] This has been a thing for a while, and I have made so much effort to create accounts, post followups, do whatever I have to do to say "Hey, I figured this out eventually" when I ran into a problem that I could not find any sort of answer to other than some ancient forum that disabled replies to posts years ago.  I try to quote the original post in my "new" post so that maybe, just maybe, Google will pick up on it.  I don't know.  I try to be the change I want to see in the world but people who do what the guy in the comic did can die in a firepit that reaches directly into Hell. [end]
[start] twaz my same exact experience the first time i switched from an HDD to an SSD, a lot of discussions but very few users bothered to do a complete explanation about how they made it [end]
[start] Even worse is when you find a post where someone has the same problem as you, the answer is completly unrelated but a mod locked the thread as "solved" anyway.  "How do I do x?"  "To do Y you simply... 'describes how to do Y'"  Locked.  :( [end]
[start] As a non-programmer as soon as I understand a problem and find a solution my first thought isn't "lets help the other non-programmers!" as it should be,  it's "lets duck out and hope the programmers didn't notice how dumb I am!" [end]
[start] Screw them people . [end]
[start] This is any software. We all suffer equally [end]
[start] # [This](https://i.redd.it/nykw6xtjg9v01.png) sums it up [end]
[start] This literally happened to me yesterday on reddit. [end]
[start] I'll PM you the solution. [end]
[start] 10 people replied.  "I have the same problem"  "I have the same problem"  "I have the same problem"  ... [end]
[start] Jesus Christ, this really does bring back memories from the dark days of the internet....   "Need help with problem"  "I'll DM you the solution"  "Mod here, locking thread because OP's problem has been solved"  [end]
[start] And now back to...Tits Mcgee  [end]
[start] And on all the other questions on the same problem:  "Just Google it" (only Google result is the "nvm fixed it")  "This has been asked before" (link to "nvm fixed it")  "Did you try restarting? If that doesn't work throw away everything you own, change your name, move to another country, start a new life and buy everything all over again. That will solve your sound card issue." [end]
[start] Fuck yeah [end]
[start] i agree with this. [end]
[start] Vote for me and we'll make this happen.  [end]
[start] And then when you post in the same topic 4 years later to ask what OP found out, the moderator will lock the topic for necro-ing. [end]
[start] Thank you. Ha-ha. I hate when people do this. If I solve a problem on my own, I always go out of my way to make sure I share the solution. [end]
[start] Information technology technology support Edit: technical? [end]
[start] Man there is a special place in hell for people that do this  Know the answer great just post it rather than being an ass saying its k guys figured it out even though others are having this issue  [end]

[start] Why do moderators lock threads anyway? Do they get kickbacks from Big Lock?  Unless a thread has devolved into something toxic, what are the benefits to locking it? [end]
[start] I'm getting a little angry reading all these anecdotes [end]
[start] I hate when you google a question and you see a thread with loads of replies so you think “oh cool this should help me fix the issue” and then literally every reply is another person saying “I have the same problem. Help!”  [end]
[start] **WHAT DID YOU SEE, DENVERCODER9?** [end]
[start] That's a redundant form name [end]
[start] Fake: the post was marked as duplicate before [end]
[start] That escalated quickly. [end]
[start] Amen [end]
[start] But then you’re killing the only one in the world with this forbidden knowledge. You’re sure you wanna do that?  [end]
[start] Off with his head! [end]
[start] New meme format? [end]

[start] I occasionally Send emails to my internal company group of techies when I am stuck with a problem and eventually when I find it (either by myself or by someone's help), I try to make sure I do a final reply all to the email to let everyone know how the issue was fixed and what was the root cause.

[start] I'm going to make a reddit bot that gets the word count of every comment in a thread and takes an average, then gets a weighted count of all words used.   Then it will make a random post with an equal number of words using those words, and repeat the process.   Go back and check each post 3 days later.  Posts that were upvoted get some more weight added to their words.  Compare it against other comments it has made to find phrases that repeatedly performed well, and so on.   Eventually I should arrive at the optimum reddit comment to make for maximum upvotes.... right? [end]

[TITLE] I feel like one of these books is misleading me [TITLE]
[start] 'in depth' probably extends 'in a nutshell', it's all covered in my book 'c# in heritance' [end]
[start] Plot twist - the notepad contains the most info.  [end]
[start] What's the font size in both books? Thats the real question.  [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] I trust O’Reilly. When they say in a nut shell they mean fucking everything. [end]
[start] All of my "in-depth" books are small because they assume prior knowledge. I was amazed when, after going through calc 1 and 2 the book for 3 was a sliver of like 200 pages. My "advanced R tips and tricks" has about the same amount too. Those beginner books are always huge and lie by pretending it's "in a nutshell." [end]
[start] I would go with C# in depth, its by the God himself!! [end]
[start] Both author s are probably british. They love irony over there [end]
[start] Plot twist: the upper book actually contains a nutshell. A big one. [end]
[start] But In Depth is written by the great Skeet himself  [end]
[start] Thought I was in r/MusicTheory for a moment. 😂 [end]
[start] C# in a nutshell is longer because it's literally teaching you to write C# inside of a walnut [end]
[start] skeet skeet skeet [end]
[start] I love the “In a Nutshell” series, but they are poorly named. They are primarily reference books which attempt to cover the whole language while being more readable than the official language docs.  They aren’t meant to be read from cover to cover. [end]
[start] In a nutshell books are more like technical reference guides. It's in a nutshell because out doesn't go into theory. [end]
[start] Almost half way through this and am really enjoying it: https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Visual-Step-Developer-Reference-ebook/dp/B017A8UAEK  This guy's last name is SHARP, so you can be sure he knows his stuff!  Plan on checking out "In A Nutshell" after I'm done reading Step by Step. [end]
[start] Ok ok ok, do you pronounce that "C-pound"? [end]
[start] I can explain this: C# in depth is written in size 2 font and C# in a butshell is written in size 16 font. [end]
[start] Well, of course. It's "[C# In Depth](https://i.imgur.com/Dfz017F.jpg)", not "C# In Breadth and Height". [end]
[start] So many new features in C# 7 that both are actually true might be the obvious answer.. [end]
[start] This is the kind of person that says "long story short" then tells you the long version of the story... [end]
[start] big nut [end]
[start] >"skeet" [end]
[start] What are the odds of two different authors, working on the same book, having the same obscure surname?  [end]
[start] Serious question from non programmer here, is that pronounced “See hashtag” or “See number sign” or what?  [end]
[start] Difference in depth and breadth [end]
[start] You need to learn to swim before you go into the deep end. [end]
[start] The first book is sarcastic..it mocks you saying O'Reilly (Oh Really?)  [end]
[start] Could be a really big nut.  Additionally, the other book doesn't specify the degree of depth. [end]
[start] Maybe the nutshell has more pictures?!  [end]
[start] Tiny print [end]
[start] That’s one thick nut shell. And that one thin in-depth .... wait a minute... [end]
[start] Font size is everything! [end]
[start] Compression algorithms are complex and getting all of C# into a nutshell isn’t an easy compression problem.   Studying C# in depth though...not overly difficult.  [end]
[start] I have C# in Depth. It assumes a working knowledge of C# as a foundation. It's not there to teach you Hello World or how to build an array. It skips a ton of what is probably the majority of the C# 7.0 in a Nutshell.  [end]
[start] "I can't believe it's not Java"  [end]
[start] The "In Depth" book must be for C# 1.0. [end]
[start] What's a C hashtag?  [end]
[start] Is this an oxygen moron lol [end]
[start] The nutshell is a really big one [end]
[start] Jon Skeet will never mislead you. [end]
[start] how to get a C in college: the textbook [end]
[start] I guess the novice has more to learn than the veteran. [end]
[start] I like C#. I should get those books too [end]
[start] This is right. In Depth is assuming you already know everything in In a Nutshell and goes into specifics without having to explicitly describe everything. [end]
[start] The in depth book is written in QHD [end]
[start] They both are. The only way to learn programming is to program [end]
[start] O’reilly? [end]
[start] Also one of them has skeet on it, so I wouldn't touch that. [end]
[start] At least one of the books is misleading.  [end]
[start] Nah, it's just like how some people spend 10 minutes to get to the point, and others are efficient. [end]
[start] well, the indepth is probably defragmented. [end]
[start] Are those books dull? [end]
[start] Has to be the one which feels the need to mention the author's name twice :P [end]
[start] Why not both? [end]
[start] TIL C# programmers have big nuts  [end]
[start] C# "in a nutshell" is probably a purposeful misnomer. [end]
[start] hmmmmmmm [end]
[start] We're talking big nuts here! [end]
[start] at least one* [end]
[start] It's both. [end]
[start] Skeet [end]
[start] Its obviously the NUT one. [end]
[start] Kind of how Lord of the Rings seems like a short read, but once you open that tiny ‘som bit** up the font is very tiny lol [end]
[start] Well diving deep into something is always contextual. We can read an in depth analysis of Marylyn Monroe, but none of us have actually gone deep into Ms. Monroe is you catch my drift  [end]
[start] Big goddamn nut they got that shell from. [end]
[start] I just read the same exact book but it was called Db in a nut shell. 554.37 pages. [end]
[start] BUT WHICH ONE IS WIDER? [end]
[start] Well obviously you don’t trust the one written by a, no _the_ skeet. [end]
[start] Jokes aside, these are both great books. “In a Nutshell” reads more like a reference book, while “In Depth” feels more like a tutorial about commonly misunderstood/advanced features of C#. [end]
[start] Finally a joke on this subreddit that I can understand.  [end]
[start] C# comes after C and before Db. How hard could it be? [end]
[start] skeet [end]
[start] Only one of them is lying  [end]
[start] C# in depth contains a CD with all the problems on an annoying website that doesn't know how to count digits [end]
[start] Font size matters. [end]
[start] see the pattern? the notepad on top has everything you need to know! [end]
[start] Top book written by brothers? [end]
[start] I own both books along with the early access C# in Depth 4, I've read both cover to cover. C# in a Nutshell covers for more about the language than any edition of C# in Depth, while C# in Depth doesn't focus on language features. Instead it covers topics like concurrency and design.  [end]
[start] Pick the book that tells you the other one will tell you has everything you need to know  [end]
[start] wow, C#7 is pretty cool but how the hell do you write 500 pages on it? [end]
[start] Nah man, the top one is a picture book [end]
[start] I didn't read the sub this was on and thought "damn, what's the deal with C Sharp"? [end]
[start] I'd trust Jon Skeet [end]
[start] So you start with In a nutshell and if you still feel you need it go in depth.  Why someone would is the question though. /s [end]
[start] You see c# in depth’s font is two times as small!! [end]
[start] C# is huge and not deep? ;-) [end]
[start] Surprise! Both are. [end]
[start] labeling a book "in a nutshell" is the most generic act one can make [end]
[start] 7.0? Oh wow just today I randomly looked at a C# 2.0 book in my bookshelf and reminisced about the past.  [end]
[start] These are actually just the prequel to the much anticipated philosophical series, IsNullOrWhiteSpace? [end]
[start] Plot twist: it's both [end]
[start] Why not both? [end]
[start] Bahaha I understand programming humor now! I am the smartest dude around! [end]
[start] Looks like a stack [end]
[start] digital proletarian [end]
[start] It’s all about that font size [end]
[start] I love how big the "In a Nutshell" books are. I want to collect them all just as a conversation piece. [end]
[start] I feel like both books are misleading you [end]
[start] Is one in comic sans? [end]
[start] Shout out to Bajirao on the spine  [end]
[start] I'm starting a new line of books called:  $programming_language *On Weed*  The content writes itself, but since the jacket design and title go into what dominates this space, I will fucking win. [end]
[start] Ummm how is the “in depth” one of less length than the “in a nutshell one” [end]
[start] Or someone's a really shitty writer. Might be that.  [end]
[start] These types of books are borderline predatory  [end]
[start] i agree. no way that book is in a nut shell. [end]
[start] Skeet skeet motherfucker! [end]
[start] Does anyone actually use programming books? Usually I can make do with google. 🤔 [end]
[start] I think they both are. [end]
[start] Christ we’re already up to 7 eh. I’m coding in 5 still for work. Only thing I actually want is $ instead of string.format() [end]
[start] The author of the in-depth book is probably using single and double character variable and method names, like a true asshole. [end]
[start] Something something mustard seed something [end]
[start] It’s just like you find out in a nutshell has 50 real pages and the rest are multiple copies of the bee movie script [end]
[start] One is poorly written the other is efficiently coded   [end]
[start] Haha introduction to books have possibly the most misleading titles, [end]
[start] Plot twist: the bottom book is twice as wide. [end]
[start] Needs a nutshell for scale. [end]
[start] Skeet. [end]
[start] It's just the two part story of a C# in a sunken nutshell.  [end]
[start] Big nutshell [end]
[start] It's just a really big nutshell. [end]
[start] In a coconut shell, maybe. [end]
[start] Coconut shell [end]
[start] That’s a big nutshell [end]
[start] What is this "book" of which you speak? [end]
[start] Nutshells can have depth [end]
[start] LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS  NUTSHELL!  https://youtu.be/jKMK3XGO27k [end]
[start] That’s a big nut. [end]
[start] C# isn’t that hard, it’s just a half-step below D [end]
[start] Oh the bottom one is in-depth, it just goes down only one branch of the tree. [end]
[start] I’m in law school and every subject has a corresponding Nutshell book. The SMALLEST Nutshell I’ve read has been 580 pages. Such a misleading name. [end]
[start] Hmm, best in town, or best around... [end]
[start] It’s that book on the top with no title.  [end]
[start] It's just got those really thin pages. Duh [end]
[start] "I've never seen nuts so big" cit.  [end]
[start] I'd buy the bigger one [end]
[start] Font size matters [end]

[start] *Image Transcription:*  ---  Stacked on top of each other, from top to bottom:   - A note block;  - Two books lying on their sides:    - A large book titled "C# 7.0 in a Nutshell" (seventh edition, written by Albahari & Albahari, published by O'REILLY®);    - A book that's the same height but only half as thick titled "C# in Depth" (written by Skeet, published by Manning)  ---  ^^I'm&#32;a&#32;human&#32;volunteer&#32;content&#32;transcriber&#32;for&#32;Reddit&#32;and&#32;you&#32;could&#32;be&#32;too!&#32;[If&#32;you'd&#32;like&#32;more&#32;information&#32;on&#32;what&#32;we&#32;do&#32;and&#32;why&#32;we&#32;do&#32;it,&#32;click&#32;here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index) [end]
[start] Is c# prominently? Curious  [end]
[start] Smaller books are always preferred over thick books. Too much crap grows exponentially. Just think of Bentley's perls, and forget about Knuth for a while. [end]
[start] Its all about the font size [end]
[start] The lower one in printed in 8 point type, the upper one in 24 points. [end]
[start] a lot has been added between C# and C# 7.0  a lot [end]
[start] Are O'Reilly books any good? Read one before I got into programming so I made 0 progress, so I forget how they're like. [end]
[start] In Depth, not In Breadth. You get very detailed instructions on how to use C# for a very specific task. [end]
[start] In depth is using smaller fonts.  [end]
[start] Skeet [end]
[start] Anybody else noticed that the NUTSHELL volume is thicker than the IN-DEPTH one? [end]
[start] Back when I learned they were written on the Dead C# scrolls [end]
[start] Why is “in a nutshell”  so much thicker than “in depth?” [end]
[start] The Twist:  There is a third book at the bottom of the pile.  It's actually just a single sheet of paper with one line:  "C# for dummies:  just use Java" [end]
[start] Why C#?  Edit: Apparently asking this question is the equivalent of kicking Bill Gates puppy... [end]
[TITLE] AI you say? [TITLE]
[start] At my job it's more like:  If(user.stepsAwayfromDeskMoreThan5minutes()  && user.hasUnsavedWork()) { update(); } [end]
[start] They used **coding** and **algorithms** to detect when you’re working. [end]
[start] [deleted] [end]
[start] Most of these bad uses of the term AI are at least talking about a series of if statements, but to get the updates as “smooth” as possible would be one if statement. If computer is on DONT FUCKING UPDATE [end]
[start] "There's an update" "Oh okay. Let me finish what I'm doing so I can save then—" "*I SAID THERE WAS AN UPDATE*" [end]
[start] "How would we fix this?"  *hires consultant*  "I got this, move over amateur"      if(user.isDoingStuff() && user.hasUnsavedWork()) {         update(later);     } [end]
[start] Mine has a GPS tracking algorithm that decides whether I have to present something in front of class [end]
[start] The real problem comes in the hasUnsavedWork() method. For example, if I'm half done typing this comment on Reddit where it won't save, does that still count as doing work? Or if I'm- [end]
[start] ~~&&~~  || [end]
[start] Why the fuck do we need AI for this? Literally on restart/shutdown just ask if the user wants to install updates for next time they start up. It doesn't have to be convoluted.  [end]
[start] Relevant: https://youtu.be/sxXs0Yy5-0Y [end]
[start] This isn't really fair, [Microsoft is actually using machine learning algorithms](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/06/14/ai-powers-windows-10-april-2018-update-rollout/) to determine the best rollout schedule for updates based on analysis of how the update is working on real world machines. [end]
[start] You know what would be great, not having to reboot to install an update. I wonder if there are any operating systems that let you do this... *cough* Linux *cough* [end]
[start] So everyone complains about Windows 10's auto updates, but I never get those. It only updates when I'm turning off my computer. What gives? (I have a surface book 2) [end]
[start] This is probably the only think keeping me from switching from 7 to 10. I like having complete control over Windows Update, thank you very much. [end]
[start] i would recommend using OR || instead of AND && [end]
[start] Where "AI" stands for Automatic Interruption? [end]
[start] These days any piece of code is "AI"  ^ was written by my keyboard AI [end]
[start] /r/linuxmasterrace [end]
[start] || would be more fitting [end]
[start] I'd be careful that Oracle don't sue them.  ``` if (display.IsFullscreen() && user.DoesNotWantUpdates()) {   window.Alert("A java update is available"); } ``` [end]
[start] I fill my hard drive to the brim with useless content so every time Windows tries to install an update on me, a message will pop up instead asking me to free up disk space. Not this time, Gates [end]
[start] While Microsoft really does need to make it more convenient to update, a lot of users just can’t be trusted to install security critical updates on their devices. The AI should take into account the intelligence of the user. [end]
[start] I don't care what they do as long as they add back in a "no" option.  "No" meaning "Fuck off with your updates I actually don't care.  I have no idea what you're changing but I guarantee I don't need or want it.  Please leave me alone forever I'll happily use this version until my PC shits itself." [end]
[start] Windows crashed Fallout 3 last night to tell me there is an update [end]
[start] Update and restart in the middle of a WoW raid... M$ really knows how to f*** me hard... If only M$ were my girlfriend  [end]
[start] Literally just had a PC located in a store do this in the middle of a business day to 1803. This is with capped data turned on and the registry scrubbed. How in the actual hell.  [end]
[start] I’m skeptical it’s an AND in that logic... [end]
[start] Apparently, incompetence is the only form of humor.  If a computer becomes sentient, that is not artificial intelligence.  Artificial intelligence is as simple as an alarm on a wind-up clock.  A human could be watching a sun dial and scream when the shadow reaches "7 AM", or we have a contraption that synchronizes with a set time each day and releases a hammer to repeatedly strike a bell when a position in a time keeping gear matches a set position.  An if statement is AI. [end]
[start] That's what the dark blockchain does! To know when you're updating. [end]
[start] If (user.IsUsingCPUIntensiveApp()) { RunTelemetry(); } [end]
[start] If you have more than 3 nested **if** statements, it's AI. [end]
[start] ||* [end]
[start] I love how it always says "Update & Shutdown" when really it means "Partially update and we'll make you wait ten minutes when booting in the morning while we finish up." [end]
[start] More like:      if AutoUpdates.disabled == True and Update1803.installed == False:         try:             Update1803.install()         except:             Update1803.install()          AutoUpdates.disableAbilityToDisableAutoUpdates('haha you fuck')  Found out the hard way, a last night. I am pretty sure I disabled Automatic updates yet fucking 1803 got installed.   I've been slacking off way too long, tbh. I'm moving to Linux [end]

[start] Set all networks you use as metered connections, downloading updates trough them is disabled by default (IIRC) so that's one step to never worrying about automatic updates (only downside being that you have to manually check for them every now and then if you want to stay updated) [end]

[start] Windows 10 is a fucking travesty, Windows 7 till I die  [end]
[start] Eesh opening the curly braces on the same line as the if [end]
[start] How many of you still use Windows 7? Go into updates and delete the KB3035583 update and block it. That’s the Windows 10 updates and launcher. There a few others but that’s the main one that starts the launch program.  [end]
[start] I really HATE those update pop-ups! [end]
[start] Windows: Oh, you have a 2k monitor. Would be a shame if someone fucked up your resolution.  *updates [end]
[start] Wouldn't this joke be funnier and truer if it used an OR operator? [end]
[start] *laughs in Linux* [end]
[start] Using Windows without being forced to is a textbook example of natural stupidity. [end]
[start] If that is what they are doing they done screwed up, my terrible updates are noticibly worse.  [end]
[start] Sometimes when I'm playing a VR game, I will get ~~elected~~ *ejected* out of it so that Windows can tell me that I have a Java update. The alert even pops up in VR.   Also sometimes I'm in the middle of something and it all goes dark. I take the helmet off and it's updating. This is why we shouldn't upload our conciousness to the cloud. One badly timed update and your mind is a worthless corrupted file.  [end]
[start] `if (user.asksYouToStopTheUpdates())      dont(); ` [end]
[start] for (int i = 0; i < 1; i--)      {          update();     } [end]

[start] Fuck Windows (10). But mostly fuck the fact that games are mostly made for the trash and continues to be in a vicious circle. [end]
[start] A PC is limited to the knowledge of its user - and that's sadly often not much. [end]
[start] Not gonna lie, the second I upvoted this my laptop decided to update itself... [end]
[start] Linux is way ahead on this front, it offloads the responsibility of choosing when to update onto an advanced biological computer, it's called "the user".  [end]
[start] I never had any problem each time windows 10 need to update I got a message and I can choose to do it later  Edit: autocorrect was in French  [end]
[start] The way I got around it is I filled my c drive, now it can't install updates. Muahaha! [end]
[start] The best part is now it seems to restart your running programs after it updates (but doesn't login). If you were on a page that plays a video, like YouTube or Netflix, but it was paused, when the page loads, it starts playing where you left off -- which for me tends to happen in the middle of the night.

[start] I'm probably going to get blown up for this but why leave the opening curly bracket up there? [end]
[start] Pretty much.  [end]
[start] I found the file that prompts and schedules updates. After it was deleted, I can proudly say I have never gotten another update notifcation and my computer has not updated.  [end]

[start] I feel like Microsoft is going to bring about the singularity just because they don't want to have to interface with their users on a human level.  I just imagine some roundtable, like:  "Alright guys, we're having a lot of complaints about updates. We need to figure this out."  1: "I propose that we update more!"  "Edgy, I like it, but updates are the thing people are having problems with."  1: "Oh, right."  2: "Faster updates!"  "Interesting, I like the sound of this. Can we manipulate the speed of light to make it go faster? Is that a thing? Anyone? Ok, I'm just embarrassed now. Tell me if my ideas are out of scope here guys."  3: "We can't manipulate the speed of light. We can optimize a little, if we-"  "Ok, got it."  3: "If we just focus on-"  "I SAID I GOT IT. Any other ideas?"  4: "How about we communicate with our users and establish a sense of respect between customers and business, so that when updates happen, users will feel like their needs are being respected and they aren't being treated like a small child by an impersonal machine?"  "Pack your things and get out."  4: "But I-"  "OUT!"  "Now, if anyone else would like to propose a solution that involves talking to other human beings, you can pack your things now. Meeting adjourned. If there are any other ideas, you can message them to my AI receptionist, who may or may not decide to let me see the ideas based on an algorithm we're trying out. Toodles!" [end]
[start] "Your updates have successfully been installed. New updates are ready to install."  - Windows [end]
[start] So I was playing Counter strike global offensive, was in middle of a very important clutch situation and suddenly this pop came (your window needs to update) out of nowhere. Good job microsoft ruining my game. [end]
[start] why do you people always have unsaved work out?? [end]
[start] update); [end]
[start] A...I...  What's the A stand for again? [end]
[start] AI stands for Algorithms and If statements. [end]
[start] By making updates smoother do you mean waiting until I'm AFK so I can't press the "do not update now" button? Cheeky bastard does that a lot. [end]
[start] My mother is a computer science teacher and, when I showed her this post, said, “I would like to add user.isGivingImportantPresentation()”  [end]

[start] Sometimes I wish writing code was this easy [end]
[start] To shreds you say? [end]

[start] BS they will just use AI to find out if the unsaved work is important. If true restart. [end]
[start] only thing I wanna know...  How did they get the gradient in the start menu. shit looks dope. [end]
[start] Never said the AI is friendly [end]
[start] Annnnd good thing i kepy my windows 7 install disk and license at the ready for when my eyeballs came across a pile of shit a lil to smelly . . .  [end]

[start] What are they going to do though? Run the AI and have it randomly choose when to update, and each time the user rates how good of a time it was? [end]
[start] if   if  if  if  if  if  else   [end]
[start] I haven't had windows update without my consent since options to schedule and confirm when the update happens were added. Before that I used group policy to require my interaction to update, but I get it that's not an idea method to be required to use.  [end]
[start] They could be using AI for their updates. They already have the code for [Tay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot)). [end]
[start] Lol this is why mac are *definitely better* than windows. /s [end]
[start] I've never had a problem with Windows 10 pro updates. It always asks me if it's a good time to perform an update and if I said no, I could either have a reminder or schedule it at a time I'm not using my PC.  [end]
[start] AI will be the new buzzword for the next five years, just like cloud was. There's no true AI yet (publically), just better analysis. [end]
[start] Windows 10 is a nightmare with its updates. What happened to the good old days of pressing a button to allow and install updates and one to pause and stop them all together.  [end]
[start] Everyone's missing the worst feature of updates: Update and Shut Down.  I tried this last weekend when I was was done working for the day and thought, stupidly, that Windows would update...adn then shut down.  However, I was greeted by about two more hours of updating the next day when I flipped my PC back on.  This is the real problem they need to fix. I have no problem updating overnight if it actually works.  [end]
[start] I lost a five page college english paper do to this stupid ass automatic update, now how are noob ass professors gonna know how beat skyrim as a pure mage on legendary difficulty? [end]
[start] I use my laptop mainly to give presentations at work. Turn it on, Windows decides to update, laptop is unusable for 45 minutes.  I don't understand how Microsoft can make something so actively bad.    [end]
[TITLE] Biggest lie [TITLE]
[start] that means: I solved a bug and created two more [end]
[start] It's not a lie - it should have worked before and it should also work now.  It doesn't, but it SHOULD. [end]

[start] programmer indicators   "Okay, I fixed it" - 5-10 bugs left   "It should work now" - 2-5 bugs left   "I have no idea, let's just recompile and hope it works" - 0 bugs [end]
[start] The bug isn't on *my* side. [end]
[start] I always use that sort of language, or "I believe it should work", after manually testing and writing automated tests.  The reason is because there's always some sort of user requirement they didn't actually tell us about... [end]
[start] Worst lie I've heard: "it's not that hard." [end]
[start] I feel personally attacked. [end]
[start] "I agree with timelines you have given me for this task" [end]

[start] My programmer teacher in high school said this:  "Don't worry if you don't know every fucntuon. Programmers will always comment their code for the next developers to look through."

Still not finished and the bill was 450k so far.  Last I heard the bill reached a million and was still not functional.   I recommended that we not used this specific company.   I was IT manager.   The CEO liked the salesman.   I was vetoed. [end]

[start] I feel personally attacked [end]
[start] "I think I know the problem" [end]
[start] "it'll be ready in about 2 weeks"  The actual release date could be in a week, or maybe a month, or maybe 5 years, or maybe never. [end]
[start] Just restart the system. [end]
[start] I mean its not a lie but still. [end]
[start] It doesn’t work because of your antivirus... never actually true [end]
[start] We’re going to use the agile methodology of development [end]
[start] A bit too relatable... [end]
[start] Now I understand what it is doing. [end]
[start] It's not a lie. It's a prayer [end]
[start] "Sure I tested it."  <20 minutes later, I'm back at his desk>  "...well?"  Me: It doesn't run. It won't even start.  "Really? Hmmm, let me see..." ... "oh. No, it doesn't run." ... ... "I guess I didn't test it, did I?" [end]
[start] "That's what the business want" [end]
[start] I have never done this [end]
[start]  It worked on their machine. [end]
[start] "It just work" [end]
[start] Eh, sometimes I have to provide estimation on how long something will take to implement. It's like playing russian roulette with a loaded… tank. [end]
[start] I've ran several tests. [end]
[start] "I'll have it done by the end of the day" (not really including bug fixes) [end]
[start] This is the exact reason I choose to say "should" and not "will". [end]
[start] Keep in mind that, when programmers say this, they're also lying to themselves. [end]
[start] I'm gonna go with, "your code ran just fine" after I sent the wrong version of a Matlab file containing nothing but a commented-out Python implementation of the algorithm. [end]
[start] I feel attacked. [end]
[start] Almost done [end]
[start] “proprietary algorithm” [end]
[start] When blizzard reviews are good. [end]
[start] Somethings wrong with the server.  Its only a coincidence that the site went down when we loaded new code. [end]
[start] Not able to reproduce it in the test environment [end]
[start] The biggest lie I tell myself. [end]
[start] A fellow developer asked me about some code I wrote 4 years ago.  He said he found my code in BaseController and wanted to know why his didn't work.  Looking at his his code on the spot he had the setting "Item".  I said I thought it was "ItemName".  When he checked the code in to fix the setting his comment said it was to fix a typo.  He hadn't tried the code prior. [end]
[start] Any claim of a firm time line is at best an optimistic guess. [end]
[start] I'll add "it'll be done by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_". [end]
[start] “The change I’m about to put in shouldn’t break anything.”      QA person here.   I get that all the time.  :) [end]
[start] I say this a whole lot in my work I now realize. [end]
[start] "It's not a bug, it's a feature." [end]
[start] It works on my machine. [end]
[start] It was working yesterday [end]
[start] Oh crap, this sounds exactly like Friday [end]
[start] Just comment a couple lines out and add do a little debugging (i.e add some print statements) and suddenly it’ll start working as the programming gods recognise the extra 10% of effort. [end]
[start] Yes, I comment my code. [end]
[start] Yesterday it was working [end]
[start] There was a french website giving all the excuses from devs  excusesdedev.com  But it is offline now -_- The best were:  "If you want some magic, just call Gandalf"  "It works on my engine"  "I'll see if i have time the next week"  "This feature has not been developped yet"  "I dont' read the report mails where it is not written  "Emergency" or "Deadlock"  "I've done it a friday at 6pm" [end]
[start] It's not a lie.  It's an appellation. [end]
[start] I know exactly what I'm doing; no sweat.  Since this is a lie I tell myself every time I write code, I know for a fact that it's a big programmer lie. [end]
[start] It works on my machine so [end]
[start] 🙏🙏 [end]
[start] This hurts me on a deeply personal level. [end]
[start] Woah, Paul Graham on the front page of reddit!  What is this, 2006? ^(I wish)  If you liked his essays back in the day, you might be interested to know that he started posting new ones several months back: [essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) [end]
[start] I always add "theoretically" to make it technically true LOL [end]

PHP can't cause a 500 error, it'll either just crash out or display an error message, obviously JS won't throw a 500 error, so what language if any could actually do this? I know it's meant as a joke and I am being pedantic but still, I am curious if anything could do it.  Thanks, have nice day.  Edit: so I've been knowledged, I'm stupid php can cause 500 errors.

[start]     try     {         //Everything     }     catch(OutOfMemoryException)     {         Application.Restart();     } [end]
[start] Mega brain, store all your variables on the hard drive. Then use the recycle bin to collect the garbage. [end]
[start] How about just letting RAM fill up, have the program crash, and reboot it? That's been my strategy. [end]
[start] If (segfault) don't; [end]
[start] If a programming language has a built in garbage collector, you can bet it's full of garbage. [end]
[start] Game idea: you collect garbage. More and more garbage is coming in so you have to collect faster. If you can’t keep up, the game will use more and more RAM until it crashes [end]
[start] Galaxy brain: No memory recovery, mount google drive as swap [end]
[start] "Just turn it off and on again" [end]
[start] At my old job there was a production program with a known memory leak.  If you used it too long it would crash and you’d lose your work (couldn’t save your work till the job was done).  The solution was to add a UI button to trigger garbage collection (really it killed the program and relaunched it, but Java was the hip new thing at the time so they labeled the button Garbage Collection).  When I started there all the users were trained that if your computer or application crashed and you lost half a day of work then it was an average Thursday (seriously, Thursday had a 80% crash rate with this application and no one knew why).  Surprisingly when we retired/replaced that application the customer satisfaction surveys for the help desk jumped to an all time high.  Its predecessor was a buggy mess that turned into a multi-million dollar lawsuit and still seen as a major upgrade. [end]
[start] The top and bottom are the same [end]
[start] How about let the compiler handle that? [end]
[start] Is there a difference between 'no garbage collection' and 'let the programmer decide'?  Am I being stupid? [end]
[start] Hire somebody to collect the garbage for you. Kind of like how “computer” and “compiler” used to be job titles [end]
[start] So... memory leaks everywhere and it's up the user to deal with them manually? Sounds like a perfect fit for the amount of effort I want to put into memory management! [end]
[start] Today is trash day for me and my brain was stuck in literal trash collection mode... Then I saw the subreddit lol. Was confused for a sec. [end]
[start] This tickled me a lot, especially the fact that the implementation effort does increase top to bottom [end]
[start] Ive used an IDE that had a button to free memory, if it ran for a while it would up then there was this button with a ram chip icon that you can press to clear some up. [end]
[start] C-- goes brrrr [end]
[start] And then there is the white house: The garbage collects itself. [end]
[start] Does the software come with a broom and a dust pan? [end]
[start] So basically modern web frontend development. Looking at you, Reddit autoscroll feeds. [end]
[start] Found the Java developer. [end]
[start] On my calculator, if your program moves a variable from memory to storage, it literally pauses your program (breaking the graphics) and asks the user if they should garbage collect. Ugh. [end]
[start] There’s actually an ide code composer that has a button for “run garbage collector”. [end]
[start] yeah users must collect the garbage they create👏👏 [end]
[TITLE] Mentoring in a nutshell [TITLE]

[start] And then I'd raise a crooked eyebrow as I wonder why the candidate is now interviewing me. [end]
[start] Ah, my favorite childhood pokemon, c++. [end]
[start] Why is hadoop there twice [end]
[start] [I use it daily.](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/) [end]
[start] i code  on "metapod" [end]
[start] ah yes, the rare C# pokémon [end]
[start] A good recruiter also notices he has hadoop on there twice. [end]
[start] Well now I'm going to name a library after a Pokemon. [end]
[start] i now want to know which presentation this is from [end]
[start] Ekans and metapod are pretty useful [end]
[start] Shiny is the double agent [end]
[start] Metapod is a great naming for a container orchestrator. [end]
[start] I once called someone to mount a sink for me. He refused to do it because I didn't have all the correct couplings when he came the first (and only) time.  Expecting recruiters and employers to know languages and technologies they are hiring for is pretty much the same thing. [end]
[start] Someone once did a "Tolkein character or drug" thing once.  I got them all right, not because I'm a doctor, but because I was a Tolkein nerd.  I hadn't heard of half of the medications on the list.  I definitely knew all the Tolkein elves (or at least, recognized enough of Tolkein's stems to realise it was Sindarin/Quenya) [end]
[start] I'm pretty sure there's javascript library for those pokemon. Edit: found a javascript library called metapod [end]
[start] ONYX is actually an online examination tool my university uses. [end]
[start] Onyx.. metapod.. lmao [end]
[start]  Recruiter: HTML is a Pokemon [end]
[start] C#/C++ gives me heebiejeebies [end]
[start] [This site](http://pixelastic.github.io/pokemonorbigdata/) let's you guess which terms are big data and which are pokemon [end]
[start] I still love that numpy and pandas are both actual things. [end]
[start] The best way to harden your security is by using metapod [end]
[start] Ditto is a wonderful copy-paste application tho [end]
[start] Charlie from its always sunny in philly? [end]
[start] Haha hadoop is mentioned twice. [end]
[start] But can't you name your own Pokemon now tho? So couldn't they all be Pokemon? [end]
[start] I don't know my pokemon that well but it seems like some of those are both. [end]
[start] Pys Park? [end]
[start] I count 4 pokemons. 😛 [end]
[start] it should be Sawk right? [end]
[start] "How many frameworks do you know?" 42  "How many are you good at?" 3 [end]
[start] “I must say sir, my nuzlocke skills are phenomenal” [end]
[start] Only plebs wouldn’t find sawk [end]
[start] Throw in a "Lehder" and say that one of them is a deceased notorious drug trafficker. [end]
[start] haha, nice! [end]
[start] Metapod totally needs to be something involving dockerized deploymnets [end]
[start] r/RepostSleuthBot [end]
[start] Why does hadoop appears twice? [end]
[start] Reminds me I need to refresh my Vulpix for my next gig [end]
[start] hahahahahah [end]
[start] Is he Jose Valim? [end]
[start] Aren’t most of these just packages in R? [end]
[start] I spotted 4 [end]
[start] are there different hadoops? ;-) [end]
[start] Ditto, sawk, vulpix, feebas, ekans and metapod are pokemon [end]
[start] Ditto being both is the best part of this joke by far... [end]
[start] wow he has double the hadoop skill [end]
[start] Also, Hadoop is on there twice [end]
[start] I specialize in feebas. [end]
[start] I can’t imagine half of these Pokémon but I still know what ones are Pokémon [end]
[start] Ditto is the best clipboard manager I've ever used... [end]
[start] Ditto Op [end]
[start] ~~I also...~~  #_Ditto._ [end]
[start] Well tbh Hadoop is a great name for a pokemon. [end]
[start] How effective would listing individual libraries be on a resume? Would it be seen as obnoxious or appropriate by hiring managers and interviewers? [end]
[start] You got Hadoop listed twice? [end]
[start] As an interviewer, I'd ask why you listed Hadoop twice. [end]
[start] Thats a trick question.  Recruiters don't have time to play Pokemon [end]
[start] relevant: [https://pullrequest.typeform.com/to/Y8o6Bk](https://pullrequest.typeform.com/to/Y8o6Bk) [end]
[start] My favorite parts are the jobs listing several front-end frameworks that do the same fucking thing like React/Angular/VueJS/Svelte.  And it's even funnier when the project is already in development. Do they really have multiples frameworks strapped together or they just wait until the end of your technical test to say they needed Angular instead of React ? [end]
[start] let's see:  Certain is a programming concept: R, python, Javascript, ggplot, d3, canvas, sawk, pyspark, sparklyR, boostrap, git, flask, numpy, pandas, scikit, pgm, bayes, h2o.ai, sparkling-water, tensorflow, hadoop, scala, unity, gc, c#/c++ (why are these combined?), neo4j and hadoop again.  Things I'm certain are a pokémon: ditto, lodash, vulpix, feebas, onyx, ekans, metapod.  Things I'm fairly sure are a pokemon, but not certain: keras, krebase.  All the rest I have no clue. [end]
[start] Hadoop [end]
[start] Hadoop is on there twice [end]
[start] how dare they group c++ with c# [end]
[start] Feels when the recruiter just happened to collect them all [end]
[start] Me: I've been doing artificial intelligence and machine learning for 3 years, specializing in computer vision.  Recruiter: Have you ever used pytorch or tensorflow?  Me: ... yes. [end]
[start] Nfl ditto clipboard manager is probably the greatest thing since sliced arrays. [end]
[start] Childish and immature. Comes across as extremely smartass. Would not hire. [end]

[start] Typescript warns you about airplanes when you're accidentally crossing a runway instead of the street you thought you were crossing.  You find the street you're supposed to cross and then you're hit by a truck because they're still allowed in the crosswalk structure even when `light` is set to `red`. [end]

[start] It's weird how people get so heated over this. No one is suggesting that because HTML is not a programming language that means it's useless or it makes you a lesser developer if you know it well. If you think otherwise you have some insecurities there buddy.  Look at it this way, SQL is not a programming language either. But there is not a cult of weird people trying to say that it is, people just learn it and allow it to be apart of their knowledge base no problems. [end]

[start] bullshit, all my gang use  server side rendering (👁 ͜ʖ👁) [end]
[start] I have 2 jobs and work with both, fight me [end]
[start] I work with both as a living. IMO Angular is the superior of the two, only if you have the ability to start from scratch, however React is nice if you need to retrofit. But I couldn’t imagine the difficulty of using react for a large enterprise application. However, React owns the web now, and Fortune 500 companies are starting to launch flagship products in the React (Disney+ for example), maybe because of performance, ecosystem, not sure. So it’s hard to argue with the majority. I’ve noticed from my team as well, React is more intuitive for veteran front end devs while Angular is more intuitive for newbies and backend devs. I think a good analogy too is Angular is visual studio (everything you’d ever need to develop) and React is vscode (barebones, add what you need as necessary). The latter seems to work better as a general paradigm. [end]
[start] Clearly Angular won [end]

Then in the acceptance testing they decide they want it to work a completely different way that requires reverting most of those backend changes. [end]

[TITLE] People using Raspberry Pi be like [TITLE]
[start] To be fair the Mac M1 looks pretty sweet and performs unlike any ARM computer I've ever seen. Even the recent Windows ARM machines. I was a little skeptical at first but now that's I've seen a few reviews from reviewers I trust, it looks like a pretty good product. I still won't ever be buying one because I can't stand Mac OS but for people who use Macs its looks to be a good machine, especially as more programs become native. [end]
[start] Yeah Microsoft Surface Pro X is one of them, however, Apple would be the one to pull it off just right. Changing to ARM requires developers to built apps for that new SoC. However most businesses or software companies won’t really rebuild their app for that new platform if they don’t have to. Most Windows users are using x86 not ARM and will probably stay that way thus not many developers will move or port their app into the platform and there isn’t much Microsoft or PC manufacturers do about that.   In contrast, Apple has more control on Macs and macOS in general. So whatever move Apple makes that affect all Macs from that point and to the future. So developers will have a reason to make their apps available for that platform    Plus, Apple has never been the one who “did it first”. They just have good marketing alongside good enough result to make that new thing a big deal. [end]

[start] 1980's is a bit late IMO. 1970's C already had if statements AFAIK.  But well, in Assembly you use code like `bne` (branch when not equal) to perform a conditional jump to a different part of the code. [end]
[start] oh just wait until you find out about assembly. [end]
[start] I used IF in COBOL and that thing is far older [end]
[start] You'd do a branching compare instruction in assembly (beq or bne). There are typically greater than, greater than or equal, less than, and less than or equal instructions as well. [end]
[start] Yandev before 1980: [end]
[start] booleans was introduced kinda late, if i know my computer science history right. And before that programmers would just use 1 for true and 0 for false.So maybe something like this:      for(int i = 0; i < capture; i++)      elem.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId); [end]
[start] John McCarthy would like a word...   He created the formal mathematical basis of conditional computation. (Was only informally defined until that point)  He sent his proposal to the committee developing Algol 60...   But it was rejected, instead the "if ... then ... else ..." syntax suggested by John Backus was used instead.  Becoming the basis of what every programming language used after it... To the disappointment of LISP programmers everywhere. [end]
[start] Technically I guess some of the earliest machines from Zuse does have need for it, so when they needed to transist from hardware modifications code changes to some changeable code.  First glimpse revealed, they did something with "Freiburger Code" with a Zuse Z22 beginning 1957. [end]

[start] Is this really that uncommon??  Aside from the inevitable syntax error that will come from writing a ton of code at once, if I thoroughly thought through everything (everything is relative...) then I’m typically just a syntax error away from some working (correctly) code.    Side note I just added a feature into a project today that did not work on the first, second, third, or fourth try however I think that was due to a lack of planning on my part.   Maybe I’m just an old school “if it doesn’t make sense in your head or on paper, don’t you dare start coding” type person but I’ve found it saves me sooooo much time. [end]

[start] Gonna guess this is posted by the friend with no money and no coding skills. [end]
[start] My friend offered me 50% stakes in a company he wanted to start. All I had to do just build rival website & mobile apps to Amazon single-handedly.  When I asked his budget, his reply was this.  "Don't worry about budget.. I have enough money to buy website domain name and playstore developer fee. Just build the app. It's groundbreaking. We will be millionaire in no time.."       We are not millionaire BTW. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 [end]
[start] He will give you 10 percent commission for building his app.  *Let's yéet ourselves off the face of earth* [end]
[start] How does someone run out of side project ideas? I'll never understand [end]
[start] There's currently someone's app project at work that has been bounced around several people including me for nearly 4 years. The idea sucks and nobody will tell the dude.  He tried to rope me in for a second time and i had to outright tell him he can't afford my time (his budget was $500 for several months of work), and that he should do it himself in gamemaker because he can't pay the motivation cost to make anyone do what is essentially data entry for a very boring app.   Now he's unleashed it onto devs he isn't friends with, and I'm sure I'll get to hear alll about how unfair it is that they want at least $50 an hour.  If anyone's curious the app was for an IP he has no rights to (Star Wars) and will absolutely get smacked by a legal team for if he does it. Yes he thinks the idea is genius. [end]
[start] Why is this so relatable lmao [end]
[start] Ideas are worthless. If a friend comes to you with an idea, be very cautious. They might be the kind of person who feels entitled to part of the work you will produce despite not bringing work himself.  The second thing to be cautious about is that ideas != business. Unless you have checked that there is an actual market and proved that it can bring in money, this will *probably* be a failure. [end]

[start] How to refactor crappy code:  Are there any known issues?  Yes: no time to refactor. Fix the bugs first.  No: don't touch it. You might break something. [end]
[start] In my experience, the biggest obstacle to writing good code has not been *changing* requirements, but an outright refusal by management to define them at all.   "Okay, what do you want the system to do?"  "Everything"  "Is it cool if we demand that this 'IPAddress' field be a valid IP address?"  "No, sometimes we use that for storing arbitrary, comma-separated strings that we can use to 'tag' things. And other times it's a phone number." [end]
[start] Let me introduce you to flexible and modular test driven development that can meet the demand for AGILE requirements...  ...  ... I'm fired? I haven't added features fast enough? But everything I've written is modular, scalable, modify able and scalable!  Fuck these people. [end]
[start] For me, it goes like this: -Let's write some good code, make sure all good OOP concepts are followed, use proper design patterns, make classes more logical...  <One feature not working>     Ok, for the time being, let's write some spaghetti code... will check later...  <After one day...>     You know what? I think I didn't follow good programming practices and I had to twist the code... Let's rewrite the whole code so that feature starts working again...       <Behind the scenes, literally copying the old code into the new modules...>  <Attempts to make a library out of it, realizes that it is not so efficient... dumps the project and visits after 2 months while searching for some interesting things in his computer>  < Can't understand shit because of no comments...>  Let's restart the whole project...

[start] Lol, but photo is flipped horizontally. [end]
[start] VirtualBox releases the cursor with the Right ctrl key. so it gets used just as much as the left for me. [end]

[start] Back in the days before WASD was a thing, Right CTRL used to be the shoot button on FPS games (Wolf3D, Duke3D etc) [end]

[start] I forgot that one even existed [end]
[start] Unless you are doing touch typing! It avoids the really awkward movement of having to stretch your fingers to do some key strokes. More people should touch type [end]

[start] Thanks virtualbox [end]
[start] Except the image is flipped... [end]
[start] Sounds a lot like the US media as well. [end]
[start] Pssshhh right CTRL is a conspiracy, it doesn’t really exist. [end]
[start] The real question is: why is there an "ISO_Level3_Shift" and "ISO_Level5_Shift", but no other level (except 2 which has only a latch)? [end]
[start] Ctrl + arrow keys is very useful, especially together with Shift. [end]
[start] I use right `Ctrl` but rarely [end]
[start] This key can get important when you're using virtual machines, but even tho I'm a programmer I never used it outside of vms xD [end]
[start] Wait, I have never noticed this key. I'll just take the good switch from it and put it in my faulty left control. Thanks. [end]

[start] Is it running yet ? [end]
[start] this is, in fact, how to do the thing [end]
[start] Don't worry the code is self-documenting! [end]
[start] So you do, and you write up a readme.md, and several months later a newer dev comes along and tries to follow it, and that's when you find out that a senior dev restructured things and didn't update the docs with new gotchas.  No I'm not speaking from personal experience why do you ask [end]
[start] All jokes aside, lack of documentation fucks companies so bad. You destroy your ability to onboard new people, and exponentiate the amount of debugging time needed.  Write documentation AS you code. Rewrite the documentation as much as you rewrite code.  Rant over, back to your memes! [end]
[start] Haha memes based on my pain [end]
[start] Yeah, this happens all the time, really. For decades. [end]
[start] This exact thing happened to me, when I had to ask for help the senior dev sent me a youtube search query, not even a video, like I wasn't doing that for days before finally asking for help. [end]
[start] But are they going to open me a Jira for this?? [end]

[TITLE] He is not qualified what so ever to teach CS [TITLE]
[start] Plenty of CS teachers/professors are amazing computer scientists but God awful programmers. That's why they work in academia when they could otherwise be bringing home the big bucks working for a modestly-sized tech company. [end]
[start] the answer to that is that you use the language that is better suited for the problem you are facing. if you have a small input it doesn't matter write at whatever you can develop correctly faster.   if not and speed matters as much as the answer then you search what is faster at the problem you are facing. basically their you have 2 option.   the old reliable c++ or you are a wakky youngster and you want to try rust (hey i am only talking what i know, if anyone wants to add and educate me, feel free, i really want to learn as much as i can).   ofc if a special library is needed then you use what you have to.   it really depends are you programming applications or solving algorithmic problems. [end]
[start] I can beat that.  One of my college professors didn't know the difference between "and" and "or". [end]
[start] So you're assuming he is bad when his job is to teach you algorithm and logic ?     I mean if you don't understand this then yeah go learn one langage, be expert in it and lose your job when the language start to be replaced by another one.     Language is just a way to express algorithm and logic. [end]
[start] Well, different languages are geared towards different things. They all have drawbacks, they all have advantages (most of them!) And each tool in the toolbox has its use. [end]
[start] I dont know your teacher but I wouldnt say he is wrong. There is no language which is the ”best” and you could technically do most things that one language can do in another. CS isnt about in which language you do it in. Its HOW you do it... [end]

[start] I prefer Materialize than bootstrap [end]

[start] utility classes.  utility classes everywhere. [end]
[start] Do you have time to hear about our true savior, css grid? [end]
[start] w3.css is an effortless way to make really nice websites [end]
[start] Went from bootstrap to tailwind. I really love it. Simpler than plain css and so flexible compared to bootstrap. I learned a lot off css but just using tailwind. [end]
[start] Bootstrap looks ugly and cliche, change my mind. [end]
[start] Bootstrap, making medium difficulty things easy. Easy difficulty things medium and hard difficulty things impossible. [end]
[start] I must be the only developer who finds bootstrap hard.  How tf am i supposed to remember so many classes.  What's the point of even having so many abstractions when I can just set the widths and properties myself [end]
[start] Me: front end developer, I hate bootstrap and most CSS frameworks with a passion. [end]
[start] every time I tell someone that it's great to have bootstrap/jquery as a backend guy, I get trolled for not using react/angular/vue with native js only. [end]
[start] As a beginner I ditched bootstrap and started using html and css. Bootstrap is huge and I don't like nested div classes. [end]
[start] I try to avoid using stuff like Bootstrap because I want to know how to do it myself...maybe that's why I never finish anything. CSS is freaking horrible and I hate it. But I feel like I'm kind of stealing with stuff like Bootstrap. I know it's there for use, but I just can't get past the thoughts.  I'm not a designer but I can code kind of well. I enjoy just about anything that isn't the beautifying of the project. [end]
[start] My problem is opposite. I want to make a pornsite but I don't know a shit about backend. Especially, where to start. [end]
[start] Despite the fact that bootstrap exists and you can cobble together a simple clean functional mobile first scale out website with less than a weeks learning...  Most sites are still utterly aids. [end]
[start] Bootstrap Studio 😇 [end]
[start] Thanks boobstrap! [end]
[start] Yup.  Am backend engineer recently converted to full stack and bootstrap is my go to when I need something quick and functional and I don't feel like fucking w/ a new js framework or what have you. [end]
[start] As an infrastructure person, I'll take a frontend written by a backend dev over a backend written by a front-end dev any day of the week [end]

[start] Despite the fact that bootstrap exists and you can cobble together a simple clean functional mobile first scale out website with less than a weeks learning...  Most sites are still utterly awful. [end]
[start] thank you bootstrap chain [end]
[start] Is there something like Bootstrap for frontend developers? [end]
[start] This is exactly where Bootstrap shines and I have on problem with people who use it in this context.    I'm a front end developer and I hate Bootstrap.  I'm given designs that weren't created with Bootstrap in mind and I have to match them as pixel-perfectly as possible.  If I use Bootstrap I end up fudging the margins and padding and columns so much to try to make them match the design that it's always faster to just code the HTML without it.  Plus I've gotten several designs that just flat-out could not be done in Bootstrap.  And besides, that way I also don't end up with DIV inside of DIV inside of DIV inside of DIV inside of DIV just to make a row of something.  I stopped programming with tables like that years ago (except with emails, ugh).  I don't want to just replace my tables with divs. [end]
[start] Ditch bootstrap. Give bulma a go. [end]
[start] This was exactly my day. [end]
[start] Overwatch and programmer humour, I like this. Tell me more about you friend [end]
[start] Happy cake day mate! [end]
[start] When I started learning web development, I used Inspect Element and ...borrowed from Bootstrap and adjusted things until I understood what I was doing.  It's a great way to learn. [end]
[start] There are few things scarier than a website made by a backend engineer. [end]
[start] I still can't believe the hubris of someone to call their project "bootstrap". [end]
[start] Foundation is better [end]
[start] I enjoy front end work and still use libraries all the time.   If you to have everything look really unique and clean you'll need custom stuff, but bootstrap 4 supports a lot of modifications to its components. Apps look very "canned" if you leave the components as they come, but adding some animations, changing colors and fonts, and some transparency can add a lot of flair if you need to make something in a hurry.

[TITLE] Fellow Freelancers will understand [TITLE]
[start] Freelancers need to learn the rate is the rate.  Determine your rate and tell that to clients.  If it is too expensive for them, they aren't your best client and you don't want the work because working for cheap doesn't do you any good.  You'll be too busy to accept the great client when they come along.     If your rate is too expensive for everyone, then you are overvaluing your services.  If you cut your rates to get a client, then that client will tell their friends and send you a ton of referrals... all at that substandard rate.  You want referrals from clients who will pay your rate, not clients who want a discount. [end]
[start] The first one who gives a number loses. [end]
[start] If my budget is $100,000 for a whole project, I pay the freelancer market rate  If my budget is $10,000,000, I pay market rate. [end]
[start] Even people who want to be employees should learn how to negotiate. [Great information](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) [end]
[start] I've got the quickest rates in the west! Pew pew. [end]
[start] Jokes on you. I get paid in exposure. [end]
[start] I pretty much avoid all freelancers that ask me what my budget is. [end]
[start] I'm making the next Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/TikTok/Whatever  What's your budget?  100 USD. I'm willing to give you 10% of the profits once it takes off, you'll be rich! [end]
[start] How to get exposure offers and kill your profession. [end]
[start] May I ask how u started freelancing? [end]
[start] This is why I only use freelance sites where a rate is required to be mentioned in the original post. Saves a lot of time. [end]
[start] As a freelancer, it's not just about pay.  The client has a problem they need to solve.  I need to know their budget in order to make sure I solve it before they run out of money for the project.  If they don't give me a budget, I may over-design and not be able to finish before they start complaining about cost.  With a budget, I can cut corners where necessary and finish what they actually need, and properly set expectations in advance.  On top of that, I don't think I've ever finished a project and not received repeat business out of it (maintenance, new feature additions & referrals on top of it).  Trying to squeeze every last bit of pay out of a project is short sighted.  But also as others have said: the rate is the rate.  Don't discount your fees. [end]
[start] Rate should be constant though right? That's the whole idea of a rate, it's based off the time necessary to complete a project not the project itself. Overall cost is what might depend on the clients budget. [end]
[TITLE] We All Are the Same, Right? [TITLE]
[start] I've legit not recognized my own code before. Completely forgot I worked on a project until I found my own name on it trying to find what simpleton wrote it. [end]
[start] I've written code so bad before that I've lost respect for myself.  One time I wrote a huge chunk of shit in JS that sorted my array of objects by their 'name' then sorted ties by 'date'.  Simple enough, yeah? I still managed to over complicate it, and what I wrote was so intricate that once I was done, I looked back at it with a feeling of dread... knowing I'll need to probably touch this code again at some point. It's the kind of stuff that, if a colleague had submitted this, would make you secretly feel smarter than them.  Having code that I dread to work on is my own personal measure of whether or not I'm doing a good job. And I wasn't, so I told myself I'd sleep on it, and in the morning I'd really hunker down to simplify this code so that I don't dread touching it again.  There's a certain shock to seeing your ugly rotten code from your past, even if it's from only 1 day ago. And with that shock comes a type of clarity that you didn't have while writing the ugly rotten code. It's your brain saying "what can I do to not work on this garbage right now?"  That level of clarity reveals the flaws that led to the rotten code... and it's always tunnel vision. For some reason, I was so determined to write my logic in JS that I didn't realize, that with minimal data flow changes, I could just do my sort at the SQL level and be done in an instant.  Erasing huge chunks of garbage code feels really good though. I keep a bookmark to that commit in Bitbucket as a reminder to not overthink. I would say that 90% of my own personal code issues are created by me overthinking the problem and being afraid that my solution wont scale. [end]

[start] They also keep their database sorted using random sort [end]
[start] I feel like the slider would be less frustrating than the arrows [end]
[start] Ah, I remember a couple years ago when this meme was popular. [end]
[start] What about the guy that generates the PI number until you find your phone number in there. [end]
[start] For some reason I read the last one like "Is this your card?" [end]
[start] The last one is the kind of technology old people used. Then they blame the technology for it being impossible to code a system that works well [end]
[start] And it only takes O(1) tries, because there are is a constant number of possible phone numbers! [end]
[start] [Universe brain] Send a different random code to *all* phone numbers and simply ask the user to enter the confirmation code they received. [end]
[start] I'd like to see the user's reaction on the last one, where it chose the right phone number on the first try. [end]
[start] Replace yes/no with lower/yes/higher and can enter your number in only O(log(n)) time! [end]
[start] My first unity project was that higher/lower game but it tried to guess your credit card number [end]
[start] How about an interface where the computer guesses and the user has to state how many numbers are correct but in the wrong position and how many numbers are in the correct and in the right position? [end]
[start] Wooow [end]
[start] Needs more machine learning. Maybe it can predict your likely phone number based on accepted phone numbers of people with similar inputs as you. "We think your number is XXX". [end]
[start] Go with the last one but also it has a route to the phone system and actually changes your number there [end]

[TITLE] Ah yes, a “fake” programmer [TITLE]
[start] Wait, it's all fake? [end]
[start] Imagine a world where people have to lie to get jobs. Where entry level jobs require master degrees at lower than entry level wages.      You have entered... The IT Recruitment Zone. [end]
[start] There might not be a law against it, but I’m fairly sure if / when you got rumbled for doing it you would be immediately terminated from the job. [end]
[start] yeah we all like to joke about how its all googling, but did this dude seriously think he could say this and people would believe him? [end]
[start] That's how someone got their job offer yanked at my place. Lied about their references, got found out when the HR person dug just a little deep, and that was all she wrote. [end]
[start] Very few programmers get a 6 figure salary. That will usually require some skills that you can't just fake. Good story though [end]
[start] This is bullshit. [end]
[start] Ever heard of fraud? [end]
[start] I've been so many former landlords [end]
[start] Sure it was your "roommate's friend", sure it wasn't noone? [end]
[start] Googling and faking it is how we all learn to program, yes.  However if you are making 6 figures and you have to ask how to do certain things you will be terminated instantly 99.9% of the time. Why the fuck would anyone bother teaching you shit if they are paying you more than 2 juniors combined while you require the same level of handholding??????   "faking it" is called being a junior because you still have many things to learn before you can call yourself proficient at your job, that comes with lower pay of course but also with help from your more experienced team-members or even tech-lead/"mentor". [end]
[start] Wait, googling and asking for help makes you a fake programmer?  Can anyone tell me if thats true so I don't have to google it? [end]
[start] There’s also no law that says you have to be truthful when they ask what you currently make. I know a guy who made like 40k and went into an interview and told them he made 90k. He got the job and they offered him like 85k. [end]
[start] Surely it's a form of fraud, no? [end]

We just downloaded .txt files from BBS's instead... or checked the tables in the manuals that came with our pc clones. Eventually we started using Archie, then Lycos and Altavista. [end]

[start] Mine is literally only the bottom left one [end]
[start] Yeah, no, I think only people living in a PowerPoint presentation debug the way it's told on the top :-D [end]
[start] I recently watched [machete-mode debugging.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcfPzxB3dk) I think my favourite new trick is introducing a 1/0 into your program.  The first time it reaches that line it causes a divide by zero exception and provides the stack trace. [end]
[start] Yes. [end]
[start] In Assembly you just add and subtract ones in random places. [end]
[start] This is a bad meme, “integration testing vs breakpoints”... what do you do when the code breaks at integration: you step thru the code with break points. These are just a bunch of testing and debugging concepts thrown together in an image. [end]
[start] I'm whichever ones are in production. I like the adrenaline rush. [end]
[start] I love the “docker?” in the top left image.  I think that’s how we all feel sometimes. [end]
[start] >docker?  lol [end]
[start] As a web dev with all these fancy debugging tools: I dunno why it doesn't work. I even tried console.logging. [end]
[start] Not sure what Docker and containerising have to do with debugging [end]
[start] It hurts that this is sooo fucking true for me.   Been using php for years in production. Still don’t know how to debug properly... [end]
[start] You forgot the duck [end]
[start] Imagine having a proper C++ debugger [end]
[start] Those bottom ones are a helluva lot better than what my co-workers do, which is just asking for help with literally zero effort. [end]
[start] There is still 129 instances of print “yeet” in my code, some of which are commented out and I don’t know what happened to the others [end]
[start]     .justfuckingwork {         background-color: red;     } [end]

[start] Oof, I am the breakpoints and print statements machine gunner [end]
[start] die('here');   ...   die('heresss');   ...   die('asdfsf'); [end]
[start] I'd use debuggers more if some of them weren't so difficult to configure. Took me hours to get VSC to debug a node application once.  Then of course, I finally manage to get it working, only to discover that, because I was debugging a jasmine test, the test was being executed inside a container, so instead of jumping to the next line in *my* code, it jumped to the next one in the jasmine code executing my code... [end]
[start] I lost it at `Console.log.out("FUCK32534")` :-D [end]
[start] Nothing beats the good old breakpoint minigun [end]
[start] Today I emailed a screenshot of an error to a coworker  for a laugh cause it was stupid and made no sense. After hours of trying to fix the damn thing.  Turned out his team had actually encountered that same error and he immediately told me what was causing it and how to fix it. Crazy new debugging option - talking to people. [end]
[start] The top is when the bug is the only thing on my task list. The bottom is when I have 5 deadlines to meet by lunchtime. [end]
[start] console.log > everything else [end]
[start] Mine is the print statement machine gun [end]
[start] print("a"); <line of code> print("b"); <other line of code> ... [end]
[start] I put breakpoints in every goddam line. Even blank lines if I can [end]
[start] Ha! Jokes on you. I only use print() statements so this chart makes me better. /s [end]
[start] SanS [end]
[start] Ngl I'm in no uncertain terms an expert at debugging and printf is my go-to tool. I've had to debug in a lot of environments where you don't have a debugger and it's an amazing tool.  Rank order your best tool is reading the codr from start to finish, checking your assumptions as you go. Your two best tools for checking your assumptions are printf debugging and break points.  Bugs are inevitable [end]
[start] `console.log('this shouldn't fire');`  `Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list` [end]
[start] I would say using breakpoints puts you pretty high lol. [end]
[start] For me debugging is just a binary search. Split the problem in half, find which half, repeat. Is it front end or back end? Back end, is it web server or database? Web server. Is it this layer or that layer etc. [end]
[start] ah yes the breakpoint gun with combined with print() [end]
[start] Who the fuck needs debugging tools if you have `console.log()` [end]
[start] Hahahaha love the breakpoint gun [end]
[start] I like how accurate the bottom right picture is. Because asking a question on stackoverflow is the equivalent of trying to get lucky and get an answer which will most likely be made some evil demon that curses you as a duplicate [end]

[TITLE] Vim for Gamers [TITLE]
[start] I despise the MacBook Touch Bar—but I wonder if anyone told them just to remap the Caps Lock key to Escape. Vim-like solutions for Vim-like problems. [end]

[start] Works fine on my MacBook [end]
[start] If it's vim for gamers, can you exit with `esc :q!`, oh wait [end]
[start] Something similar happened to me. I was in vim editing a configuration file and the touch bar crashed so I had no way to exit/save or anything. Absolute trash.  I ended up having to highlight/copy/paste into notes. And reboot to get the touch bar back. [end]

[start] Matlab: wish granted [end]
[start] But, disregarding the fact that it was that way since the beginning of time (or something along those lines), what is the actual use of starting at 0 instead of 1, which would be the natural way of counting indices?  And don't get me wrong, I love the fact that arrays start at 0, just to make jokes about how some other things should start at 0, just because "we are programmers" :D [end]

[TITLE] Mentoring in a nutshell [TITLE]
[start] Student: Asks question.  Me: Googles question. [end]
[start] Me, a junior dev working a bug report: Any idea how this happened?  Coworker: I dunno. Ask Senior Dev, he's been working with this for years, he's pretty much the god of this repo. He'll take one look and diagnose it immediately, he's that knowledgeable.  Senior Dev, God-Emperor of the Codebase, Keeper of All Knowledge: *(looks over the problem and all gathered info)* Wow, this is weird like wtf [end]
[start] This happens when the senior tries to continue down the junior's solution path. Sometimes you just have to crush their dreams and tell them to start over. [end]
[start] What are you doing, step senior dev? [end]
[start] Best thing a mentor told me was that he didn't think what I was trying to do was possible. Not that my approach was wrong, he thought the problem wasn't solvable. So naturally I solved the problem on my own. [end]
[start] That’s the point tho right? To ask questions? (Especially if they tell you to do so) [end]
[start] Ask away. This is how people grow! [end]
[start] Imagine getting a junior dev position :/ help [end]
[start] Oh no step doe [end]
[start] inb4 some degenerate coomer makes a step-sibling joke [end]
[start] Apes stuck together! [end]
[start] Both ask Project Manager for help*  30 min later he sees you forgit a Semicolin ; [end]
[start] And thank you for helping and I promise to ask again later because I was nervous the first time I said that I understood [end]
[start] Senior dev not only has to figure out the problem, but also how the junior dev managed to mess it up 🤷‍♂️ [end]
[start] \*Googles that anyway\* [end]
[start] Maybe it'll be me by next year. I just got hired to a new company as a Senior Dev, I got surprised since I'm expecting that I'll be just a mid level position since I have only 4yrs of experience, I asked the human resource who recruited me why I became a Sr. Dev and said that it was based on my technical assessment during the recruitment process. So f*** it! Good luck me! lol [end]
[start] It's 50/50 as a mentor. You either know the solution right away OR it's a bug that's been haunting the team for years and the PM threw it on the new junior because they are evil. [end]

[start] Now I understand why I have to close down chrome every couple hours to free up ram...  It was all part of the plan. [end]
[start] Mega brain, store all your variables on the hard drive. Then use the recycle bin to collect the garbage. [end]
[start] Game idea: you collect garbage. More and more garbage is coming in so you have to collect faster. If you can’t keep up, the game will use more and more RAM until it crashes [end]
[start] If (segfault) don't; [end]
[start] At my old job there was a production program with a known memory leak.  If you used it too long it would crash and you’d lose your work (couldn’t save your work till the job was done).  The solution was to add a UI button to trigger garbage collection (really it killed the program and relaunched it, but Java was the hip new thing at the time so they labeled the button Garbage Collection).  When I started there all the users were trained that if your computer or application crashed and you lost half a day of work then it was an average Thursday (seriously, Thursday had a 80% crash rate with this application and no one knew why).  Surprisingly when we retired/replaced that application the customer satisfaction surveys for the help desk jumped to an all time high.  Its predecessor was a buggy mess that turned into a multi-million dollar lawsuit and still seen as a major upgrade. [end]
[start] How about just letting RAM fill up, have the program crash, and reboot it? That's been my strategy. [end]
[start] Galaxy brain: No memory recovery, mount google drive as swap [end]
[start] Is there a difference between 'no garbage collection' and 'let the programmer decide'?  Am I being stupid? [end]
[start] If a programming language has a built in garbage collector, you can bet it's full of garbage. [end]
[start] Hire somebody to collect the garbage for you. Kind of like how “computer” and “compiler” used to be job titles [end]
[start] How about let the compiler handle that? [end]
[start] "Just turn it off and on again" [end]
[start] The top and bottom are the same [end]
[start] Today is trash day for me and my brain was stuck in literal trash collection mode... Then I saw the subreddit lol. Was confused for a sec. [end]
[start] So... memory leaks everywhere and it's up the user to deal with them manually? Sounds like a perfect fit for the amount of effort I want to put into memory management! [end]
[start] C-- goes brrrr [end]
[start] Yeah, the people who ask me to reset their password twice on a single call should totally be responsible for garbage collection. [end]
[start] Ive used an IDE that had a button to free memory, if it ran for a while it would up then there was this button with a ram chip icon that you can press to clear some up. [end]
[start] Does the software come with a broom and a dust pan? [end]
[start] So basically modern web frontend development. Looking at you, Reddit autoscroll feeds. [end]
[start] On my calculator, if your program moves a variable from memory to storage, it literally pauses your program (breaking the graphics) and asks the user if they should garbage collect. Ugh. [end]
[start] It's about time the users start pulling their weight around here [end]
[start] Download more ram when the program runs out of memory. [end]
[start] Imagine if computers literally have a garbage tray where trashed memory go and you can physically pick it up and throw it out. [end]
[start] Programming noob here. What's garbage collection mean? [end]
[start] Wait. What about the garbage created by the prompt that asks the user to collect garbage [end]
[start] This tickled me a lot, especially the fact that the implementation effort does increase top to bottom [end]
[start] Found the Java developer. [end]
[start] There’s actually an ide code composer that has a button for “run garbage collector”. [end]
[start] yeah users must collect the garbage they create👏👏 [end]
[start] Aren't "no garbage collection" and "make the programmer responsible" the same thing? [end]
[start] So it's no garbage collection then?! [end]

[start] Yeah but the assistant is disgusting to look at all the time. [end]
[start] I was expecting Angular joke from Ben, tbh. [end]
[start] C# is like looking both ways before you cross the street, but when you try to actually cross the street, you find that you can't because you're frozen in place, and the walk light turns into an up arrow, so you look up, and there's the airplane. So you have to start all over looking both ways *and up* and try again... [end]

[TITLE] Ah yes I'm a Ditto expert [TITLE]
[start] Is sparkling-water an actual libary/language? Im sure its not a pokemon... [end]
[start] All that and no inclusion of the Porygon line, who are canonically made of code. [end]
[start] Who lists individual libraries? Jesus, my resume would be 700 pages long at this point.   And "c#/c++" as if they're somehow related? Quite a bizarre mess. [end]
[start] Double Hadoop knowledge [end]
[start] ditto, vulpix, ekans, metapod. Am I missing anything?  I'm only sure about the first generation. After the 3rd gen, I have no idea. [end]
[start] Position requirements: - 5 years vulpix experience [end]
[start] I am planning to learn brainfuck just to put it in my resume [end]
[start] Almost counted onyx but spelling matters. [end]

[start] Ah, my favorite childhood pokemon, c++. [end]
[start] And then I'd raise a crooked eyebrow as I wonder why the candidate is now interviewing me. [end]
[start] ah yes, the rare C# pokémon [end]
[start] A good recruiter also notices he has hadoop on there twice. [end]
[start] Well now I'm going to name a library after a Pokemon. [end]
[start] [This site](http://pixelastic.github.io/pokemonorbigdata/) let's you guess which terms are big data and which are pokemon [end]
[start] I still love that numpy and pandas are both actual things. [end]
[start] The best way to harden your security is by using metapod [end]
[start] Why is hadoop there twice [end]
[start] Shiny is the double agent [end]
[start] [I use it daily.](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/) [end]
[start] i code  on "metapod" [end]
[start] Metapod is a great naming for a container orchestrator. [end]
[start] I once called someone to mount a sink for me. He refused to do it because I didn't have all the correct couplings when he came the first (and only) time.  Expecting recruiters and employers to know languages and technologies they are hiring for is pretty much the same thing. [end]
[start] Someone once did a "Tolkein character or drug" thing once.  I got them all right, not because I'm a doctor, but because I was a Tolkein nerd.  I hadn't heard of half of the medications on the list.  I definitely knew all the Tolkein elves (or at least, recognized enough of Tolkein's stems to realise it was Sindarin/Quenya) [end]
[start] ONYX is actually an online examination tool my university uses. [end]
[start] Onyx.. metapod.. lmao [end]
[start]  Recruiter: HTML is a Pokemon [end]
[start] C#/C++ gives me heebiejeebies [end]
[start] My favorite parts are the jobs listing several front-end frameworks that do the same fucking thing like React/Angular/VueJS/Svelte.  And it's even funnier when the project is already in development. Do they really have multiples frameworks strapped together or they just wait until the end of your technical test to say they needed Angular instead of React ? [end]
[start] let's see:  Certain is a programming concept: R, python, Javascript, ggplot, d3, canvas, sawk, pyspark, sparklyR, boostrap, git, flask, numpy, pandas, scikit, pgm, bayes, h2o.ai, sparkling-water, tensorflow, hadoop, scala, unity, gc, c#/c++ (why are these combined?), neo4j and hadoop again.  Things I'm certain are a pokémon: ditto, lodash, vulpix, feebas, onyx, ekans, metapod.  Things I'm fairly sure are a pokemon, but not certain: keras, krebase.  All the rest I have no clue. [end]
[start] how dare they group c++ with c# [end]
[start] Me: I've been doing artificial intelligence and machine learning for 3 years, specializing in computer vision.  Recruiter: Have you ever used pytorch or tensorflow?  Me: ... yes. [end]
[start] Nfl ditto clipboard manager is probably the greatest thing since sliced arrays. [end]
[start] does it go above 5th gen?  the newest pokemon i can recognize is sawk [end]
[start] i now want to know which presentation this is from [end]
[start] Ekans and metapod are pretty useful [end]
[start] Haha hadoop is mentioned twice. [end]
[start] But can't you name your own Pokemon now tho? So couldn't they all be Pokemon? [end]
[start] I don't know my pokemon that well but it seems like some of those are both. [end]
[start] "How many frameworks do you know?" 42  "How many are you good at?" 3 [end]
[start] I'm pretty sure there's javascript library for those pokemon. Edit: found a javascript library called metapod [end]
[start] Throw in a "Lehder" and say that one of them is a deceased notorious drug trafficker. [end]
[start] Reminds me I need to refresh my Vulpix for my next gig [end]
[start] Ditto being both is the best part of this joke by far... [end]
[start] Also, Hadoop is on there twice [end]
[start] I specialize in feebas. [end]
[start] Well tbh Hadoop is a great name for a pokemon. [end]
[start] How effective would listing individual libraries be on a resume? Would it be seen as obnoxious or appropriate by hiring managers and interviewers? [end]
[start] As an interviewer, I'd ask why you listed Hadoop twice. [end]
[start] Thats a trick question.  Recruiters don't have time to play Pokemon [end]
[start] relevant: [https://pullrequest.typeform.com/to/Y8o6Bk](https://pullrequest.typeform.com/to/Y8o6Bk) [end]
[start] Feels when the recruiter just happened to collect them all [end]
[start] Tensorflow I choose you. Learns the other Pokemon's move and take 20 minutes and give a prediction with 50% accuracy. [end]
[start] Ditto is a wonderful copy-paste application tho [end]
[start] Charlie from its always sunny in philly? [end]
[start] Pys Park? [end]
[start] I count 4 pokemons. 😛 [end]
[start] it should be Sawk right? [end]
[start] “I must say sir, my nuzlocke skills are phenomenal” [end]
[start] Only plebs wouldn’t find sawk [end]
[start] haha, nice! [end]
[start] Metapod totally needs to be something involving dockerized deploymnets [end]
[start] r/RepostSleuthBot [end]
[start] Why does hadoop appears twice? [end]
[start] hahahahahah [end]
[start] Is he Jose Valim? [end]
[start] Aren’t most of these just packages in R? [end]
[start] I spotted 4 [end]
[start] are there different hadoops? ;-) [end]
[start] Ditto, sawk, vulpix, feebas, ekans and metapod are pokemon [end]
[start] wow he has double the hadoop skill [end]
[start] I can’t imagine half of these Pokémon but I still know what ones are Pokémon [end]
[start] Ditto is the best clipboard manager I've ever used... [end]
[start] Ditto Op [end]
[start] ~~I also...~~  #_Ditto._ [end]
[start] You got Hadoop listed twice? [end]
[start] Hadoop [end]
[start] Hadoop is on there twice [end]
[start] Time to make a library with Pokemon names (or something that sounds like a Pokemon. Pls don't sue me Nintendo) [end]
[start] Metapod [end]
[start] You talking mad pokemon for someone in nerd distance [end]
[start] All of this, but then the recruiter needs AWS. Smh. [end]
[start] I know some of them ain't real! xD [end]
[start] https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/client-sdk-javascript.html  Everything exist as a js framwork 😂 [end]
[start] Pure relatable [end]

[start] LOL 2 times Hadoop [end]

[start] Sure, the first in might be first out, and the last in might be last out, but what about everything else in between? Nothing about FIFO or LILO implies all the elements will be in any order.  We need a new acronym to specify a queue is ordered by arrival time in the queue, and no element is jumping the line!!! 🤣👍 [end]
[start] I just read up on python queues and now I am mad, because it's name does not make sense.  A queue, naturally, is a LIFO structure, but the python queue is s FIFO structure, just like a stack.      Why? Just why? [end]

[start] A language is a language. [end]
[start] It's weird how people get so heated over this. No one is suggesting that because HTML is not a programming language that means it's useless or it makes you a lesser developer if you know it well. If you think otherwise you have some insecurities there buddy.  Look at it this way, SQL is not a programming language either. But there is not a cult of weird people trying to say that it is, people just learn it and allow it to be apart of their knowledge base no problems. [end]
[start] Html is similar to boiling water. For many recipes you need to boil water but that doesn't mean boiling water is called cooking [end]
[start] As for nowadays standards, being inclusive is cool. So, I accept HTML as a programming language. [end]
[start] Source tweet? [end]
[start] Twitter is the new Google. [end]
[start] ~~HTML5 is though, no matter how much this sub hates that fact.~~  I was misinformed, what is colloquially referred to as HTML5, is in fact a combination of HTML5, js, and CSS. [end]
[start] Recount! [end]
[start] It's a language without features like loops variables etc added on [end]
[start] The war on declaritive programming has entered the misinformation age [end]
[start] If HTML is a programming language, then XML and JSON are programming languages aswell!  What? They have the same structure. [end]
[start] Geez its in the name people, Hypertext markup language.... Ie. Not a programing language [end]
[start] All languages matter [end]

[start] I remember first programming lecture in uni when lecturer asked us with what kind of programming languages we are familiar already. Buch of people said HTML, I just wanted to scream but at the end lecturer did it in my place. [end]
[start] You spelled HTML wrong.   It’s spelled JavaScript.  Glad to help [end]
[start] CSS is a programming language though, because you can declare variables.  /s [end]
[start] With HTML you *program* a system (browser) to do particular things. Isn't that the definition of a programming language? [end]

[start] You got Windows and MacOS backward there [end]
[start] I have used all three and can confirm the mac and Linux panel. Windows users are more crying about dll errors and whatnots than actually doing stuff. [end]
[start] Um ouch [end]
[TITLE] Of course, the first answer is better than the second [TITLE]
[start] It’s probably disliked simply because the person didn’t bother checking that the answer was already there and just reposted the same thing for no good reason other than laziness or trying to get votes/points.  See it happen all the time [end]
[start] Based on every single time I've seen this, the top answer is from 2008 and the bottom answer is from yesterday. [end]

[start] Its always funny when your german speaking client demands you to use "german code" (So all variable and method names are german).     Biggest "problem" is the correct use of CamelCase, as you can easily make a new noun in german and no CamelCase is needed. It leads to inconsistencies as different developers use different approaches. (Its not a big problem, indeed)    One Example:   If you have an entity (no matter what you named it) and you have a "version" of that entity as own object. In english it would be:   Class Entity() and Class EntityVersion()   In german you could easily do "Entityversion" but some words require an connecting "s" when compounding them. Lets take "Vertrag" (wich means contract).   You would have:   Class Vertrag() and Class VertragVersion (CamelCase as its two Nouns) or   Class Vertrag() and Class Vertragsversion (No Camelcase as it is a german compounded word) [end]
[start] Compound words are a thing in many languages, though. Including English. [end]

[TITLE] Execute the Code! [TITLE]
[start] I don't get it.  You shoot your HTML why? [end]

[start] Html is not code [end]
[start] I doubt anyone binds their Enter to compile and run. More like shift-F10 or something. [end]
[start] `$ killall -s KILL code` [end]
[start] Execute html lol [end]
[start] `sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root`   is how I execute my code [end]
[start] Enter won't run any code... Standard shortcut to run code are F5 and Ctrl + B [end]
